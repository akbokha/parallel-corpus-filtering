Munich 1856 : four cards that change your view to the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people are to meet with young people .
a p@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle , where it is du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers to generate the lon@@ ely reason of pe@@ as@@ ants .
the oldest official map of Mün@@ ch supports exciting stories about days .
there are nervous when maps are not currently underway .
everyone knows everyone who had to exc@@ it@@ ated because the car Nav@@ i had to display a green me@@ adow .
the historical map maps of the digital Bayern atl@@ ases , an offer of ge@@ op@@ ort as the Bavaria of the state government , are all other than currently - but just very easy @-@ to @-@ end .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then , the cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of Munich Mercury has changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern Atlas is a flip @-@ epp@@ ing , whom you don &apos;t know as such .
into the large map map for cities and municipalities with more detailed maps , so @-@ called urine sheets , were incorporated .
these were produced according to the Bavarian publisher of Bay@@ erns between 1810 and 1864 and sk@@ ip the first survey of Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader in Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second coalition war with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops entered the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 1801 : there were today &apos;s neighbours that created the idea of a country @-@ wide Bavaria @-@ card .
Kur@@ für@@ h Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian failure .
the prehistoric sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is how to find out all others on the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of early / today is the case of the state capital on the most impressive .
the town has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is Unter@@ send@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
ship@@ ling was born 21 years after the map , in 1877 as a Munich district .
today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the H@@ ouses are concentrated around 1856 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which only named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the Bavarian pe@@ as@@ ants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where the Western park is , you can see nothing as a fields - at first glance : when in @-@ zo@@ oming appears a small @-@ part map with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten entries from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ absorption , &quot; which was derived from the fundamental tax .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are no farmers there today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
the Theres@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , in the 19th century , was still a me@@ adow , and there was no concrete desert in the 19th century .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map shows an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the urine sheet we read in the area of today &apos;s au Hai@@ d@@ hausen area &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the guest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the height &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also in big letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ Field Road , one had once used people with mad@@ ness .
there was in 1858 / 59 the Munich circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ge . &quot;
in 1872 Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den managed to set up the establishment of a psychiat@@ rist who is associated with King Lud@@ wi@@ gs II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; he was advanced for his time and ended for example the t@@ apes of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
in addition , he has taught the staff to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt .
it was first place for 280 patients and later was extended to 500 seats .
sometime , this capacity is not enough - the reason for the construction of the circul@@ ated plant in hair in 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of the largest psychiat@@ ric area of Germany .
at the area of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people gathered in Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order bought the building complex in 1920 and turned him to a youth center with training .
situated to the west , the soccer field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built in the archit@@ ec@@ torate of origin of the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ al , which was destroyed during the Second World War . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Marien@@ platz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was recorded as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the merchants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger street &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Mün@@ ch .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies broke out many holes to the downtown in December 1944 .
a big remained until today - on the Marien@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages , where these days are working on the Marien@@ hof , where these days are scheduled and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony will take place for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be easily compare with the aerial picture of today - and the hole on the Marien@@ hof .
Civil Rights publishes travelers for Missouri
the National Association for Promotion of Far@@ ms has issued a warning for colored people who travel to the state @-@ discrimination and racial attacks from the state to Missouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Advisory Committee for the State of Missouri , which is scheduled to come into effect by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a series of frag@@ mentation that occur in the entire state and will be noted here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group .
a recently built @-@ in law of Missouri , which makes it difficult to win discrimination against discrimination , as well as the criminal prosecution authorities , the group led out the travel documents , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have injuries of the civil rights to pass through . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they will be put together because of their skin colour , they are defeated or killed , &quot; said the president of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are listening complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the group spent inci@@ dents like r@@ um@@ ber@@ nation against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died in frag@@ ile conditions at the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol more petrol , and from the police in custody , was accused of accused of accused of crimes .
the Council also indicates a recent report by the Office of the General Prosecutor of Missouri , in which it will be shown that black drivers are more common than wh@@ it@@ ers in the state 75 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that human beings are aware and their families , friends and employees about what will happen in Missouri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people must be ready to bring it to the money , or have the relatives knowing that they go through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Missouri was in the year 2015 100 Hass@@ elt , after the latest numbers from the Hass@@ ver@@ break @-@ report program of the FBI , which regul@@ ate the state in relation to the number of injuries to the 16th place of the country .
the travel agent is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it difficult to acc@@ use a company due to residential or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ al Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) travel dates for Texas and Arizona , after the States decided to commit local prosecution authorities to dec@@ eive people because of immigration fraud , which will contribute to the survey of AC@@ L@@ U .
travel documents are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , but in recent days , stakeholders have contrac@@ ted the measure as response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
Wei@@ z@@ aun@@ ting project is Elem@@ ental
the fisher@@ man Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bundest@@ ag@@ s@@ men Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have a picture given itself on the spot .
in the rec@@ ov@@ en@@ hof of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fisch@@ erb@@ acher CD@@ U county joined together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ uties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann also granted insights into its operations in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young people and houses in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative way for him of the world &apos;s alternative solution for the milk of its cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the table of the guests there is a Regional Office .
since he is also the BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , he called the &quot; Elem@@ ental Project as &quot; Elem@@ ental Project . &quot;
I can do not generate on der@@ art steep surfaces .
the green past@@ oral care for much work , much shots with the brush@@ cutter are mach@@ ined .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here with the terms and conditions of the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the el@@ ter@@ nal operation and management of these without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it does not lead a bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the Wei@@ z@@ aun@@ ts and is delighted about leader promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , the farmers will have to be supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope that the power of the land could still be cast out for a while . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure that we have , are the people who work in agriculture , and imagine thoughts , as they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers are often in criticism
in 2013 , about 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the dis@@ closure area is thus 40 hectares , which will not be for@@ ged until at least 20@@ 23 .
it was funded by the total cost of 71 500 Euros , half of the leader was funded by the municipality of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach .
thus , the farmers stayed 12 610 euros which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not make a really good job , without farmers and farmers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter White , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best food is produced here &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Constitutional Court ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ t@@ emberg enables the state support of wheat fence .
the aim is the dis@@ closure of the Black Forest .
a prer@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR recorded funding .
in addition , the enclosed area should not be bad damage ( hang@@ ar over 35 per cent ) and must thus be threatened by issu@@ ance .
for the 2018 i@@ fi@@ aun@@ ting project 2018 , the application currently runs from eight participants with 24 pitches , which would like to build almost 16 kilometers of fence .
the dis@@ closure area corresponds to 35 hectares , with a total cost of more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes off the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est signs of a regime change is to attack the statues .
the Americans estimate the same as any other - therefore the carefully taking Saddam Hussein &apos;s place on the Fir@@ dos place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he did a symbolic battle with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CNN &apos;s proposals for dra@@ stic restriction of legitim@@ ate immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ ilers and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have it gel@@ yn@@ cht when he had done it .
but he took their significance , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to the famous po@@ em of Emma Lazarus , 17 years after the completion of the mind , its base was added .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom , which enligh@@ tens the world .
the po@@ em , which you refer to which later was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is objec@@ tively true , but how he formulated it itself , is not really about history .
it goes around the contemporary reson@@ ance of Lazarus , the only thing in which a state is not just any old immigrants , but the poor of the poor : &quot; your poor , your poor , and your afflicted masses , which is to bre@@ athe free , / the afflicted waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there never had a time in which the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; el@@ ong@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better to see on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller committed themselves not in literary criticism - it clearly did that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps USA .
this conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate : it is in fact a conflict around the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after her death on the basis - did they knew a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Repub@@ lic@@ ism by combining the female subjects of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in its po@@ em is the female figure no more abstract - it has received a voice .
and there is one another name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ants .
the combination of the painting with the picture is a brilliant femin@@ ist Cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just like Lazarus the significance of the statue , the people wanted to change the people from right wing as long as long .
the big Schrei@@ h@@ as Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was con@@ serv@@ iced , but rather an early neo @-@ con@@ serv@@ atives , which will bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues .
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom of the United States in the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not shine in the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh click here to something .
the meaning of the statue is quite a question of the perception of perception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great imag@@ in@@ ative perc@@ ei@@ ving of Lazarus was to see how they saw from the exhau@@ sted , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s true sens@@ es to see the world from perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their statue says to them the words of hope and of the will they hear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to detect .
their tor@@ ch shall not shine on the way , but the hat@@ red , which is their only source of power .
world Championships 2017 : Neil Black lo@@ osed Scottish Members of the Great Britain
Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle participated in a time when only two Sch@@ otten belonged to the UK team .
the power director of the United Kingdom of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member of Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship &quot; have a solid contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for 2017 , which will start on Friday .
black believe that &quot; in Scotland something special was developed &quot; and the athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue to continue until we &apos;ll need to figure out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I speak with people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athletics Men : it &apos;s something to do something to do what they have done .
and also with the type of street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5.000 m track while Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle was elected to the team .
&quot; Eil@@ id@@ h is quite modest .
their capit@@ als was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or exercise , went out of the room and felt very motiv@@ ated and were very motiv@@ ated .
the passion and the real feeling of course the Eil@@ id@@ h was very natural . &quot;
the Commonwealth of silver med@@ alli@@ sts who will compete with its fifth world championships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dles , says it &quot; incredibly &quot; is that 16 Sch@@ otten are in the British team .
Scotland has previously been the best total number of athletes at the World Championship in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mu@@ ir &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; centre of Mu@@ ir &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leads to this path and placed two European records last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be able to participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m of rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , which runs 1,500 m , is another Sch@@ otte that one should see the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of her first world championships as the only other Sch@@ otte in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the capit@@ als says that she is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enormous pro@@ ud@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the fact that many of their farmers are not only for the team , but in some cases also with medals and fin@@ anci@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so special about the team capit@@ als , it is that it was voted by the other members of the team , so that my team mates voted for me and voted me to something very special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously , I &apos;m very proud of all the vill@@ i who belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes , who want to go to Po@@ ships .
what my speech concerned as cap@@ turing ?
Yes , I think it was good .
I just pointed out that in this situation , we are very happy because we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back in the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go and compete , and it will be just like a great atmosphere because there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block yourself from critics over Facebook : Be@@ ver@@ b not to carry out a public office if you don &apos;t use voters from voters .
the father of our country knew something from bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of the interior policy until his political principles .
he imp@@ lied with criticism , safe .
but he did not bring his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the year 1783 Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the expression may be taken away - and , du@@ m , and dum@@ b , we are led as sheep for the slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland Larry H@@ og@@ an who has to work to work more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans employees have blo@@ cked the contributions from at least 450 people and cleared their opinion on its official Facebook page .
and the American Civil liber@@ ties Union accused him of this week .
the staff of the governor left the law@@ suit as the fri@@ ar , and the online @-@ comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like h@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is no re@@ ac@@ tionary p@@ inion .
he has shown a strong hand on the leadership of his state and strict observ@@ ance of the principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary funds to connect to his voters and play his hair@@ less head towards chemotherapy on his side .
hence , the block@@ age of people who are on the side of the govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , which is officially designated as officially , and of employees that are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and finally dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post def@@ ended H@@ og@@ an &apos;s spokesperson for Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse , argu@@ ed the actions of the govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that the block@@ age of the comments may not be more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of trol@@ ls or chambers or water filled people which force the wh@@ ip online .
the post spoke with some of the real people who were blo@@ cked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders , a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no consol@@ ation .
they all said that their comments respec@@ t@@ ful , think and not prof@@ ane .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and app@@ eals to H@@ og@@ ans &apos;s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani von Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ole , but she demanded of Hass@@ elt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to Hass@@ elt and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote in the commentary area of the news &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not believe this idea if a number of people take on the same theme , then they are mis@@ regarded as a so @-@ called collective use , and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the employees of the govern@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; others probably would call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blo@@ cked a critic or negative comment .
it is much more clean than in previous time when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical conductivity and dis@@ assem@@ bler or dis@@ assembling , and to silence .
but just that happens just digitally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials , who critic@@ ises Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users who have been blo@@ cked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to the US District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when it appointed a voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit to AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter .
that should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiply between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous post@@ p@@ ens on his leadership .
and then , Washington had anonymous Tro@@ l@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people , the pseud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pet@@ itions that had critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with the UK , according to the historical documents , which were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project .
but he did not bring it to silence .
freedom of speech , opinion of opinion and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means that to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort at Renaissance Club
former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days at home comfort , since the Renaissance Club is held at East Loth@@ ian , the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who was last year in the arch@@ er@@ field links until the end of the end , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is joined by the new venue and performs as a tournament sp@@ ies in the name of the Club &apos;s founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he reaches his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Raphael . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best side , it is in a good condition .
Jerry has made a great job when he established this place .
he is a jeal@@ ous disc@@ ol@@ oration of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although it won in his 32 @-@ year career in both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels particularly to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , as it was in the year after I won it out of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one who will always estimate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary OR@@ R who was born after his 50th birthday in this year at the European Senior Tour , returns to the ground .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s always a little more if you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want it well , but you felt this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed it again , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad , as far as it went . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer by passive smoking
in the past two decades , less people are dead because of passive smoking on lung cancer .
scientists meet at the University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer accidents are attributable to passive smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said study director Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he moved to this topic in the subject of 1994 .
at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer due to passive smoking a year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; .
house@@ keeping connections can be seen as a very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße is in full swing and &quot; are acceptable in the time , &quot; then the leader of the Bau@@ gate Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of house@@ keeping connections , the situation is more complex than suspected , since the under@@ floor is much hidden , what is not in the plans .
the traffic , which is always handic@@ apped to the construction work , represents a large problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ ms of drivers in front of red lights and lock@@ ers are enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hein@@ ze &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the bus buses are right .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from the St@@ ump@@ p company has been working with working on the bridge since weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were very nice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but fortunately we have looked at our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Marvin Des@@ or@@ z .
poverty and death in Indonesian Gold@@ land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cooked dinner , uses no cooker .
they even use just rarely a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ aries in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife normally lays a sweet potato , locally as &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly into the chim@@ ney .
after half an hour the carbon@@ ated Kn@@ olle will be taken with eggs , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed up .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also has its daily work , e.g. dresses with cloudy water from the nearby s@@ umpf .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lan@@ tern .
as the youngest of four wives of her husband , you have not assigned any fields .
poly@@ gam@@ ie is common here .
of course I can work too late for working hours : most vill@@ men are unemployed , and many are heavy , and there &apos;s the soldiers here .
&quot; nobody ch@@ ased it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; says her .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversi@@ al referendum in Indonesia than 1.0@@ 26 oldest in front of the occupying troops should vote .
an existing movement , touched the independence of independence , turned out quickly against the government of Jakarta that maintains control of foreign journalists and foreign journalists or legal status of them .
in 2003 , the province was officially opened in Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea as the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so far as it is br@@ ittle . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a mor@@ dial 5 @-@ hour drive with car rental .
there are no public transport .
the town with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by b@@ am@@ bo@@ ot@@ ers , and from corrugated ro@@ ofs that were converted by rust in different gel@@ b@@ brown tones .
only very few of Indonesia have done their journey here , for@@ ge journalists and practically no foreig@@ ner .
before Christian mission@@ aries , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans came to a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not p@@ am@@ per@@ ed to bear this clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and indicates their lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , its dar@@ ker shirt and their bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we only had leaves in our body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s largest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the biggest and most profitable gol@@ mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort reached US $ 3.1 billion of gold and copper only .
in addition , Papua resources has a value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
however , these riches are a spring of affliction for the Papua , who ensure that Indonesia became a first military presence in Indonesia .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local Mil@@ itä@@ ran@@ ge@@ ons and units paid almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150.000 US dollars to one single officer .
pap@@ acy recei@@ v@@ ables after greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden g@@ ans and are treated gn@@ at .
according to the activists , more than 500.000 of Papua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed by the Indonesian army , tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 .
massacre in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tri@@ es@@ land in 1970 @-@ 34 years were executed in the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for genocide .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful protest@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;ll lose all things &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in a report of the year 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture , rape and electro@@ supplements are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s difficult to count the number of victims per week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bolts have reinforced , as Pap@@ u@@ as Resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development changed itself as Muslim economic immigrants from the popul@@ ated island of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra , and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ning ch@@ urch@@ ins sell chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ us@@ c@@ ce served .
local people fight for here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants began to sell chick@@ ens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua New Guinea , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ eth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local , which moved to the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has the native Papua New Guinea &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - their market costs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the crow@@ ds and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , said during his election campaign , the in@@ equ@@ alities and the legal proceedings in Papua
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .
but in Papua has little changed , and today the loc@@ als will feel betrayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts have broken , because we have agreed in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with anticip@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a deep point for two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is in October .
on 7 December 2014 , there was a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle .
the dry children said to them that they should switch their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers participated in their sound and later came back with four soldiers , the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , pursued and struck the group with their tissue , they were victims and witnesses .
then , one of the soldiers into the group of children .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so bad@@ ly struck that he fell into the Com@@ a .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission set fire on fire and the things put on the next day .
about 1,000 young people , women and children gathered themselves together at a soccer field before the local police station and the military police centre to request justice .
they carried cer@@ v@@ oni@@ ously hunting fighter and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a bird @-@ proof - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to overcome stones at police and military po@@ s .
when the atmosphere was heated up , a command was sent over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three resistance , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it is not released in an official document by TI@@ ME , which was not released in an official document .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ pping risk and called for peace and demanded the amount to return home .
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned back , I was shot in my left hand in my left hand , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colorful wooden house .
Kay@@ ame knows not yet , who has devoured , but says that the ball came from the rows of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was over@@ crow@@ ded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was taken three times , so his c@@ ousin , the Wit@@ ness of the revival was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I went to him and instru@@ ct his body to go safely , that he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ oh@@ anes , who , like many of Indonesia , only bears a name , the TI@@ ME &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I have kissed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tro@@ ug@@ ging of the Papua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said rep@@ lied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to secure his station only &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because they were attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people are threatened to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua Police , Commissioner Pud@@ ong Su@@ ff@@ i@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it goes around life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more viol@@ ated .
the news about the k@@ illings came first on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jakarta .
three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i stayed in Jay@@ ap@@ ura a passionate talk given in the sympath@@ ies of the victims of the victims of the victims of Papua New Zealand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to be solved in this case , so that it will not pass in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
security minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 to establish an extra@@ judicial mechanism for settlement of historic human rights violations .
but the expres@@ sions began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred before long time .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the early 2000 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed to face these violations , but there are processes that have to be passed through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he did a withdrawal when he spoke with TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jakarta with TI@@ ME and said , he had no plans to create a complaint mechanism .
instead , &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , accused of crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been buried in Papua New Independence , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were contrary to these alleg@@ ations with fierce dis@@ believers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times four times , but there was no progress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I have afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid to be arrested by the military , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai was afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was defeated by the military , after he helped four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I was buried the dead , the military sought after me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bre@@ wer@@ ies have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on village residents in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ front@@ ation between village residents and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drunk in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital .
displac@@ ed vill@@ agers protest@@ ed in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones into officers , having responded by the warning by using warning shots .
but the loc@@ als say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian par@@ amil@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the amount and killed one .
&quot; we were so in pan@@ ic , we have fear that there is reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives and witness close to the hospital , as the last here is the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to withdraw officers to withdraw the government and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a quiet place for the Indonesian government .
the lack of sen@@ su@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family @-@ affiliated to Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the Reb@@ ellen@@ istic Army , who claims to defend the rights of Papua , having spor@@ adic attacks and demonstrations by Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Y@@ og@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ oya .
in response to the past few years , thousands of people were arrested in pan@@ i@@ ai and arbitr@@ ary in custody , under the pre@@ text of the &quot; securing of national so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty . &quot;
some dive never again .
among men in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tra@@ gic , For@@ gotten Place &quot; .
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is for loc@@ als too expensive .
bread is just above reach .
the people here build everything they eat : especially emergency and fruits and vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of the sweet potato
they retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces emer@@ ge only 10,000 in@@ dones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 cents ) .
during the time , economic in@@ equality between the loc@@ als of Papua and the new migrants have grown that Nab@@ ire has arrived in bigger number since the opening of new flight routes .
the few jobs , which are in the region , go to the better trained and prosp@@ erous migrants .
in Papua , the capital or the necessary skills to lead their own company competitive .
&quot; young people are not interest to stay in the village ... for here there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the headquarters of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes from Papua New Guinea .
Moreover , limitations of international media will remain vulner@@ able .
at the beginning of the year the French journalist Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported by lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they had given the rare permission to films .
according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the convic@@ tions of Jok@@ ow@@ is , were to raise restrictions on the reporting to promote transparency and development , not realized .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists , trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Papua and West@@ pap@@ ua , and a black list , &quot; he said in a declaration .
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains limited to the immediate neighbours Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six pairs of Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine and the Salom@@ one islands - the UN Human Rights Council to examine the &quot; various and widely used injuries &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have histor@@ ically seen the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir pointed out the Group &apos;s accus@@ ations and said journalists in Jakarta : &quot; in Indonesia still has a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to prevent the evidence of human rights violations . &quot;
people want to know that more foreign governments should take this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right @-@ ambassador , Ke@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that participated in the session , but would like to remain anonymous .
in 2019 , Indonesia left another presidential election , but the Papua say that they are probably not able to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Council .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , in addition to that it is among the constant threat of a her@@ ber@@ ian military , in arm@@ ist@@ ical education and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai men , like others of Papua , consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt , &quot; which he must pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want only righteousness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of thre@@ ats and en@@ dow@@ ment , families of Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uss@@ aud led to the last symbolic act of the dead : the cor@@ ks of an op@@ sy was buried on a site exactly compared to the police and the military station .
they perhaps know that they might never get righteousness , but at least they will not forget the responsible persons responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us , with his head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers from Dubai for the second time
a fire was found on Friday in one of the highest residential doors of the world in Dubai its en@@ book and forced hundreds of inhabitants , from the 337 meters high , 79 @-@ story building .
it is the second fire which is located in just two years by the high building , which is called by the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we are involved in the fire alarm and the cry of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran@@ ce the stairs down , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; told a inhabitants that called his name as George attacks , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais civilian protection authorities told that the units of fire fighting is 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 p.m ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they work on the provision of shel@@ ters for the person concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident may be asked questions about safety of materials that are used in external areas of high buildings around the world , revi@@ ve .
a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch @-@ building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage caused by the cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation .
in Britain , the police , they believe that the system of records for the insulation and the fair@@ ing at the London Gren@@ ada tower in June to the spread of a Bran@@ der could have been killed in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis courts ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through its large Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , the for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup @-@ single was only supported on two winning sets , hood is not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
although they often have very long , but also very estimated five @-@ sentence classic remain the traditional way .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the members voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore just missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not received the complete reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historical con@@ tests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work , improve the application .
not only for the vote , according to many claims before the proposal , the finals has come to a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be able to have the host right in the following round .
in order to reduce costs for the organis@@ er , the requirements in terms of training kits etc . and players will need to complete the official media event before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring along the airplane , a survey carried out
a survey conducted among airlines found that more than 20 percent conscious un@@ conscious items on the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which ended the aircraft , while they had forbidden knives or other objects with blade .
less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered that they were ir@@ resi@@ zed with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey conducted at more than 1.000 people - who was conducted by a jet Char@@ ter@@ service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , conducted by younger trav@@ ellers rather than the rules .
of the respon@@ dents , that they might have tried to fly with something to fly that by T@@ SA was 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , members of the generation X were .
the most commonly used objects which were inten@@ tionally covered by T@@ SA agents were food and fluids .
more than 3 percent gave to know @-@ related items with clin@@ ches caused by security control , whereas 2.2 percent of women survey@@ ed and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents had confirmed that they had ab@@ normal@@ ized drugs into the aircraft .
the company said , they have asked travelers in the whole country to find out how many hidden dirt @-@ ware caused by the airport security , and how many would have done it .
no surprise , it is no surprise that people who carry out the most common dirt - know who were most common in the most common .
however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often un@@ certain that can take them or how much of them .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest quantity of the T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated objects are prohibited .
a long time thought the people , the T@@ SA could watch books as dirt .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla clients
electric @-@ thous@@ and@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far , he has under@@ estimated that a part of the customer has already withdrawn its obligation .
in addition to the always triumph@@ ant numbers on sales growth and more gig@@ antic sales targets , Tesla CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k also betrayed the latest quarters of balance : the cancellations made at the new mass market model 3 .
in the past few months , Mus@@ k frequently asked more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose extradition starts just .
now Mus@@ k is a : of the total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders have been withdrawn back to 63@@ ,000 .
critics always had pointed out that it is only adequate for reservations .
at a cancellation fee of € 1000 ( in the US $ 1000 pounds ) and in the UK 1000 pounds ) pay a reservation payment .
at present , 45@@ 5.000 of these suggested reservations , Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with anal@@ ysts .
that the cancellation of so far were about twelve percent of all orders to be problem , the Tesla CEO does not believe .
his argument : the challenge at the ambitious growth target is not in demand , but on the production site .
Tesla 84@@ ,000 cars delivered last year .
in 2018 , all models have been merged - 500,000 being one million .
the demand is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , a day of 1800 reservations are currently accepted .
if you are ordered today a &quot; Model 3 &quot; must be delivered in the second half of 2018 , when Tesla manages to drive its n@@ ag@@ el@@ new , still never in practice @-@ tested production lines without greater interrup@@ tions .
many experts doub@@ ting that it is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it comes to larger del@@ ays , then the in@@ firm@@ ities of the reservations may be made for Tesla . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for then , the company is not able to hin@@ d the company un@@ satisfactory customers .
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt draws together because of the withdrawal of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after he had been accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the environmental protection authority , his previous decision returned to reduce the implementation of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g caused by smo@@ ked air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency proved to meet the needs of the state environmental authorities , compared to re@@ jection faster than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit against his previous job in a federal state court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it comes to a deadline that ran for countries on 1 October for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; standards for &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would carry out the observ@@ ance by one year , to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid the economic decisions in local decisions . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s Prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent of environmental protection regulations .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed to block , regul@@ ating or delayed , the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal feedback for the P@@ ru@@ d@@ regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Constitutional Court decided that the EPA stew@@ ards had exceeded his authority when he tried to adopt the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas company to monitor the monitoring and reducing methane emissions .
in a position published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ sted ordered that his swe@@ eping force in o@@ zone is simply simply the read@@ iness of EPA for cooperation with the states through the complex process of legal fulfil@@ ment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often observed the dead@@ lines for the implementation of activists and others , and in an agreement the appointment of the execution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who claimed the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in a regulation by judicial proceedings , and we assume dead@@ lines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nonetheless , the opinion of the EPA reported that P@@ ru@@ ined sometime his &quot; powers to the delay and all the other legally available &quot; will make use to ensure that the rules &quot; on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Congress falls on a more comprehensive re@@ iter@@ ate of the O@@ zone rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one last month &apos;s permission is to be delayed by at least eight years for implementation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the measure was not set up in the Senate in the Senate .
the New York Secretary @-@ General , Eric Cut@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition led to the EPA in this week , said the group int@@ end to just@@ ify the statutory pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the return of the EPA - according to our buyer - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.7 million Americans that are affected directly from smo@@ g which flows directly from smo@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said cutting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York included in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil @-@ o@@ zone arises , if pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refined , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the smo@@ ked smo@@ g can cause serious bre@@ aches of people serious breathing problems , and contribute to thousands of premature death cases .
representatives of the public health system and the environment for more than P@@ itts surprising course change .
&quot; it &apos;s un@@ pleasant , as much pressure it needs to get this sensible step by the responsible for the protection of the air which we bre@@ athe , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d of Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting the ide@@ ological cross @-@ train of the Tr@@ ump government , focusing on environmental protection and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

organisation wants to check approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sees no legal requirements for the construction and has therefore turned to the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; has asked &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) promp@@ ted its approval to the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen , only at the time limit of Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal exists a wind power concentration zone .
within this concentration Zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are possible in principle , at the same time the concentration Zone however delivers an exclusion of wind power use for the rest of the town .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ver@@ aging &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of the city had a few days earlier due to a change of land plan for a second wind power station in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but which was not approved by the Düsseldorf District Government , because of a failed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of approval is the authorized approval of per@@ taining to such un@@ lawful and therefore , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
state of the things : the city council has decided once again the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a approval of the district government is still standing .
Er@@ kens : &quot; in this point , it is excluded at this point of approval for the construction of wind turbines . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the collection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding writing has been received since the last week of the circle &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said one speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes it to the occasion to test the matter again .
however , they do not expect that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a look at the ongoing procedure for the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle was unable to express with regards to the arguments of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans on a surface at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four per 200 meters high wind turbines .
last year , the company had already involved , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is involved , P@@ acht@@ deb@@ ars with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of great terrain .
with the erection of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of approximately 11 400 households can be covered , which corresponds to approximately one fifth of the power requirement of all four thousand households .
NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
in the past summer there was a green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen and a shar@@ ehol@@ ding in a wind turbines in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .

tran@@ scription between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and Dri@@ vers of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump in a telephone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto on the occasion of the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto would not hear that he would not pay for a planned border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US President imp@@ lied him , because he had publicly den@@ oun@@ ced the wall in public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press can &apos;t say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his Presidential campaign with promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ ware , Mexico for the project .

Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activ@@ ist activ@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ seater Ford Mercury went through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ inking beyond Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver , the bridge could reach the bridge , a group of white men came up with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the Mo@@ bs - a man of medium @-@ aged @-@ aged men - took a long train to its cig@@ ar and looked after the wind@@ shield .
inside woven the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ aring the man .
&quot; H@@ ol it from the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams rent the silence , when a young black man was crushed by the passenger seat .
fortunately , this awesome scene was played on July 22 , only one night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if a loop is thrown by the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all in the audience is very real sig@@ h . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , citizens came back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to follow the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was charged with murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is truly unbe@@ atable that in all these years , although we see them in our churches , although we know who are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Congress of State of Georgia and a life of civil rights .
it serves as a dramatic call for him as a dramatic call for action , and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that there was never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to be prosec@@ utions , we want to cure , but we want reconciliation , but first we need to receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to cure and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a judicial medi@@ ator puts a beg@@ gar on the bodies of one of the victims of Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ne on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI files that were received from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding county were suspected .
but none was charged ever .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot since decades , Citi@@ zens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch campaigns in the whole city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision made by the Supreme Court of Justice made the black citizens in Georgia to aband@@ on their voice in the summer .
approximately at the same time like the FBI &apos;s choice , Roger Mal@@ col@@ der Roger Mal@@ com had a white base owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - allegedly at a woman .
Bro@@ oks said that rum@@ or had been in the city that H@@ ester had lain with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy , and that the baby she had brought them not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white farm owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ col@@ t from prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cou@@ sins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey in prison .
but when she was away from prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge is approaching , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b reached the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it looked out , it was Harrison who prepared the mur@@ ders and arranged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; includes a FBI &apos;s report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a witness between the state and local criminal prosecution that had not only been involved in murder , evi@@ den@@ oun@@ ce evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks formulated it even more fun .
&quot; it was a voting rights , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost one decade Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene headed the annual delivery of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their presentation is vivid , po@@ ign@@ ant and is justified in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many believed that he did not exist in America .
it &apos;s hard to look , and more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we are con@@ fron@@ ted in all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot establish any relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or listen to what I have made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest black - in a room and l@@ ur@@ ged , when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ split overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ enes co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the b@@ oss cl@@ an member since years , but he said that I never become easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to get this story in life because we would not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , playing Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester to play their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the h@@ ester cri@@ es and it pressed him that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my own property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ all@@ y@@ er@@ wi@@ es the fire .
there is a break .
and every ( at least all the black actors ) occurs in laughter .
Gre@@ ens laugh@@ s at lu@@ k@@ est .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked sh@@ all@@ ying .
he is al@@ arms and conf@@ used .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still k@@ ich@@ ern@@ d .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t believe that white people back then &apos; n --- &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yet , funny one of the other black dar@@ ker .
&quot; you only need to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly there are the energy in the room , a feeling of camera body replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy , this is correct but not only because of the game but also because of memory to the four killed people .
the scene begins once .
this time , when Ras@@ ch says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no laugh@@ s .
this repe@@ ating is violent and quickly .
there are scre@@ ie , nuts and then silence .
a woman , dressed with a wedding dress , is about the cor@@ p@@ ses of actors and leads Billi@@ ons holidays tru@@ ern@@ de Lo@@ bre@@ de &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; .
their voice breaks out every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it is a group of about four dozen people swe@@ at swe@@ at and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost evenly between black and white .
a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many are only down the road .
they experienced almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as inhibit@@ ing moisture , when Bro@@ oks she runs on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point the Mor@@ de has remained one A@@ ne@@ k@@ d@@ ote , but now when we found on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air felt down .
if the last notes of the songs , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer to inspec@@ ting the dead bodies .
children cur@@ ls to their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and st@@ akes body and whis@@ per@@ ing one another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ dered by a little boy , than that he would remember it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene the amount - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ x eil and wi@@ pe her tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw embra@@ ced Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit which the cl@@ an@@ member has played .
Nick sh@@ all@@ im@@ pover@@ t two of his fellow @-@ player and breaks out in their arms , and the emotional load of performance breaks finally with him .
&quot; it is okay , whis@@ per@@ ed one of women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this from a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience reli@@ es together with the actors for dinner together .
at a table , a white pair of Atlanta was stim@@ ulated about the follow @-@ up with a black pair which they had just learned .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fighting words to find words , which has left the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to listen to these terrible words and deeds ... of people who like yourself and they do that , because they look like , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really do I do with me , I believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police shooting is called &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks stops on his table , he will eat and remin@@ is@@ cent of the civil rights .
he said , he already started planning the performance in the next year .
&quot; the delivery is inspir@@ ing in a certain way , because it describes the terror of what we bear , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s so if we do nothing from it , then it will happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own story who doesn &apos;t know his own story , is sentenced to repeat them . &quot;

the performance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ et@@ eam .
he had to leave a g@@ ell@@ ous pipe concert in 2013 , there were five years later , there were five years later , in which the single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Fest@@ spiel@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have pleased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we noted that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience was not just a form of peace with cast@@ orf , but it is also an understanding of its vision .
I draw a positive conclusion .
Max amount works as volunteers
they work in several sites in their volunteer year .
where to everywhere ?
amount : normally in stone furt in the furniture exchange , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked in the open full day at the school .
how are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a nice , broad spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late volunteer volunteer .
how does that come ?
lot : I made S@@ LC .
and then a civil course , we &apos;re talking to successfully .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have known for me that it is for me , and I want to do something else to work with people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then I asked what are you doing .
do a social year , there is an insight , since you can see how it is on site , in the focal point , maybe even , really .
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my study in the winter semester .
I will dual study dual study , probably in the youth office Her@@ ne a social worker and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not something unusual to have several different fields for volunteers ?
quantity : Yes , it is very variable .
it &apos;s always on it , where you will be his FS@@ Y .
you can do it from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ettes of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I also was in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care .
for me , it was exactly what the right thing pleased me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it is really running .
differently than in civil engineering ?
quantity : well , here it is not how to calculate St@@ ati@@ ken .
one always has other people , each other , each other history behind itself .
whether a refugee , whether a youth who has been picked up from the family - one must always go on it .
very interesting .
and you had no contact anxi@@ ous ?
quantity : for this I am not the type .
there is a field that gives a lot .
great love , much kindness .
there are also negative moments , but so is that life .
Pear@@ son over@@ thrown 3,000 jobs and over@@ thrown the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will build a further 3,000 jobs and their intermediate dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be started to overcome the pressure , with which the company is con@@ fron@@ ted .
the Stell@@ bau , Director General John Fall@@ on , announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which already lost 4,000 jobs .
Pear@@ son announced a plan for cost reduction in May in a third cost reduction by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business by the fast step towards digital learning .
the company that had sold his participation in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after it achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds .
con@@ voy Attack by Kabul : NATO @-@ soldier killed by suicide attacks
a suicide con@@ voy attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital of Kabul , a soldier of NATO and several others viol@@ ated officials .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter have been viol@@ ated , an explanation of Nato .
un@@ approved local reports were killed during the incident in the district of Q@@ Arab , three civilians .
the bombing is the last violence that met Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ bed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of Nato , the explosion occurred on Thursday evening , when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people of impro@@ vised explo@@ sives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement is estimated that all the last in a stable condition and in the U.S. military hospital will be treated at the Air@@ field Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and group which is known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ Arab , is a concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to UN United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July a suicide motor@@ om@@ be killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kabul .
the Taliban said they had been executed this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the center of the city increased more than 150 people with the killing of milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US forces seized the Taliban by force in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the pre@@ m@@ ise safety situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering the number of U.S. troops to assist the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government to have caused politics and especially in the call of President Ash@@ raf Gh@@ ani .
EPA returns to the delay of the smo@@ g rule by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to prevent the government of Obama &apos;s government , that the states are obliged to prevent smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions to prevent smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 states accused the agency because of the st@@ ep@@ per .
the EPA announced late in Wednesday the decision to describe the &quot; o@@ zone Rules 2015 &quot; in advance , and said to show them the obligation to the agency , together with states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our State partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt was announced in June the intention of EPA , the o@@ zone rules - in which part of the country &apos;s pollutants are to be determined to determine where inj@@ ections are to be delayed by stric@@ ter air quality standards , to be delayed by a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed a law@@ suit and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to put a wide range of environmental impacts on the former president of Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda that is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of Democrats and reserves , who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EPA website says that the in@@ hal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function and intensi@@ fy the lung function , such as As@@ thma . &quot;
Municipal Council wants a common room
at the end , the decision was clearly : in two counter@@ voices , the Municipal Council of River @-@ Win@@ ke stim@@ ulates the establishment of a community space in future senior citizens .
in front of the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing property is signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although there will be still last until now the church community is owned by the community , but there is now no planning event for a private investor to st@@ em@@ its project .
there is a discussion regarding a shared space .
one of the two investors who are still in the ship , offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor he would provide a living space of approx . 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with all 70 square metres of space available for a special price .
the administration and majority of the Municipal Council , such a common room is not just a meeting point for the inhabitants of sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ righteous living room , but open to the municipality .
as an example , the word of &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision will be decided by the provision of funds for the current household already in the past fall , by funding options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
construction is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a shared space would be reported that T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent .
the decision sees to sign@@ alize the investor that you can &apos;t throw any b@@ ill@@ el between the legs that is due to him in this regard , as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - what the tr@@ amp @-@ height reduces and the construction of economic power - it is possible .
unnecessary , so not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this addition .
if it helps : unanimously it happens the panel .
it is not so easy to enter the community .
Daniela Call to the many own building , with whom you get not so well before the common room is in the window , says : &quot; I do so bad@@ ly so . &quot;
Y@@ v@@ onne Sta@@ iger is absolutely recommend@@ able for the common room - but absolutely against the public participation .
it looks behind it a covered payout at the same or even Foreign Invest@@ ors .
this is not so , because with the acquisition of the area you give no grants , but get a real , in a bi@@ ble fall , the counter shall be contra@@ sting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ ig@@ er &apos;s application , the decision accordingly to the decision , finds three fears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , in two counter@@ parts at the original program , Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ ises , &quot; If we summar@@ ize the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

it was not good . &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes on a performance increase in the first official compulsory game of the season .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is a &quot; difficult , intensive game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the resin of Stern to star
in the Har@@ z , the nationwide first &quot; star arrow &quot; will emer@@ ge .
this is planning the association Z@@ ob@@ servatory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary route in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star@@ ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come to meet the information needs of many Har@@ z@@ visited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connector , science , movement , and sporting performance .
members want to present along the planned route panels and inform about stars and stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during the first phase until 2018 the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well achiev@@ able installations on five to six places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
demand for St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ e@@ ge@@ i@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be supplem@@ ented by the Internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the site selection .
accessi@@ bility is a crit@@ erion .
later the star train is to be expanded by train .
&quot; on the star path , the viewer experienced much knowledge about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association .
in addition , they learned different colors , or why a star swe@@ ep more light than another , although it &apos;s essential further away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , in which constellation can find out a selected star and when he was best to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has already been operating in the town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 at the highest the highest star in northern Germany .
the site is located in the middle of the National Park Har@@ z , according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the six dark regions in Germany .
frequently , from there the milk road and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 there is a little simil@@ ar@@ able to the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen initiative since 2003 .
beginning in front of the Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the inside of our solar system , the planet leaves up to Hain@@ berg and the ob@@ servatory , as well as an &quot; non @-@ underground &quot; location in Di@@ emar@@ den ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the st@@ els with the single plan@@ ets - including the d@@ warf @-@ sided p@@ lu@@ to the end point - exact distance between one and a scale of one to two billion .
the earth sh@@ run@@ k on a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the exactly 75 metres away , the sun measures 70 centi@@ metres away .
the total distance of the planetary drives is about four kilometers .
during the light from sun to P@@ lu@@ to about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour to st@@ ele with p@@ lu@@ to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than the light in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the march to the next fixation star would take another half year .

when the pair was pos@@ ed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is climate , that a possible show@@ down between fighting the &quot; perfect magn@@ itude &quot; would be .
&quot; I &apos;m a former fe@@ ather of spring , remin@@ ded Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I am risen to Br@@ oner &#91; at 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big .
I am small for 140 .
I want to download it for lightweight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he must move on light weigh@@ ted &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will demand the fans .
let &apos;s give it to them . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko voted .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
climate change asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko should be able to agree on the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after the light weight title in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; this struggle could take place in pay @-@ through @-@ View mode , because all fans asked after him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and pressed himself later to fight with the network that offers the best financial package .
we are the best .
no other names can produce this type of attention .
when ever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said that he sh@@ ak@@ eth Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko gave the generous praise to Gar@@ cia and said that he think the tri@@ athlon Champion from River@@ side looks very slowly , I &apos;m sorry for Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to get the K@@ o @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus is to show stroke strength , then boxing .
both said they could feel the Mom@@ entum , which he built for their own struggle .
&quot; this is the battle that must be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters and that is Mik@@ ey .
it will be a great struggle . &quot;
four last tire fin@@ er
in an accident on A7 Thursday , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was lost at 4.@@ 30@@ pm shortly before the connection station , probably , after a ty@@ re space he would take control of his vehicle .
the passenger car went right into the vill@@ agers , where he beat down and remained on the roof of the gr@@ ale .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured during the accident .
during the first power supply of the emergency service the A7 was locked in direction north for approximately one hour , then the traffic could be enclosed on the left side by the accident .
Fort@@ &apos;s Hoffmann : &quot; Dre@@ aming chain works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 season open@@ er to Braunschweig , that the optimization of the def@@ ensive information is bringing in Au@@ e points .
with the first half of the season , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , as there were not the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents to much , and we have to fit in au@@ e even better &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the def@@ ensive player from Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge the thresh@@ ing chain should also be further optimised .
and a fool &apos;s gate after a fre@@ eze , you don &apos;t want to talk about any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be no more next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will improve even after the experiences in preparation with the Dre@@ aming chain , than with the quad@@ ru@@ ette .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how we &apos;re in au@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says his trainer is safe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we just have just mounted on the half chain in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , we are still better harmon@@ ize and we don &apos;t aff@@ ord to aff@@ ord a lot of play errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also drives Hoffmann to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you cannot speak after a mis@@ sl@@ ant start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we can focus on Sunday with four points and we will focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk of a regular season open@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of them his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start into the season I evaluated only after six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm radio , who would not speak of an advantage to aud@@ e , only because the game of Saxony had to be canc@@ eled due to an un@@ certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player from Au@@ e maybe could be something fresh , since they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know as 100 percent where they are currently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the interior of the Fortuna . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhineland can finally go from the Rhineland as light favorite on Sunday to the En@@ counter ( almost ) finished stadium from Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we leave it , only because we have the claim to come under the first six , is nakedness of radio , whose balance is quite positive at only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga , which one must strike in the world , &quot; explains Fort@@ &apos;s Principal coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a statement would be ar@@ ro@@ gant and ex@@ travag@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so , Funk@@ el wants to experience his player on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish Asy@@ l@@ age evaluation tests published
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . however , everyone believes on the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for For@@ ens@@ ische Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ rate inal@@ c@@ et ) has begun with the implementation of the tests last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should be more precise during the asylum proceedings after the Swedish migration Authority ( mig@@ rations ) because of the correct age of some refugees were critical . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to now , Mig@@ rat@@ es@@ et 6,@@ 880 was sent to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31st July 2017 .
eighty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years of age . &quot;
the tests will only be conducted in cases where the age of the person is question@@ ed .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are durable in the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a great difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are rather constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged as over 18 years , does not necessarily means that the asylum seek@@ ers has been v@@ owed over his age .
in May , the Agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there would be 4@@ 42 cases that the fact that the person was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det published the 5@@ 81 published results , she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly so that they will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , which are made with the rays of white teeth and MRI images , which are analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ised in some areas .
a sc@@ ep@@ tics is the end@@ ocr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work has the assessment of biological maturity of people to see whether they were earlier or later than usually through the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t believe that the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biological age in this way is very un@@ certain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot tell you , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , def@@ ending the accuracy of tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is low .
the biggest risk is in this case , if the person is under 18 , this is approximately 10 percent . &quot;
full in Plan

but those who are already before the start of the event , don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ collectors but demonstrate it .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the town @-@ pic@@ nic was planned under the slogan &quot; All on a table &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place on the parking below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly before the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers .

the police arrested many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows its presence in front of the railway station , which is only a few metres from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually came to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel reports that he was ende@@ av@@ oured to obtain such an event and get the surcharge .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf was first asked to get there in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Laur@@ enti@@ us kir@@ mes are not enough parking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; well the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased to announce that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; overlooking the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does it : at 20 o &apos;clock on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle various Red@@ ner , among them the Rhineland @-@ p@@ fäl@@ ische Af@@ D leader Uwe Young .
in the room there are approximately 200 list@@ eners , which are waiting for the German Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k hold their spe@@ eches .

somewhat more than one hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests in the court have a longer breath , but also there is shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can g@@ aps - no special inci@@ dents .

Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her bis@@ exual
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese , and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I want to try everything , so Kri@@ sten Stewart completely openly about her bis@@ exual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I have in gr@@ illed cheese , I think , &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of the Hollywood stars was the way to her &quot; T@@ wil@@ ight &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , which ultimately went out to the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all the insured the brun@@ ette table opposite the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in very serious , whom I have seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you believe about , I would have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after its separation Kri@@ sten she had bis@@ exual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always lived for du@@ alism and believed seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never been conf@@ used or handic@@ apped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I liked it just never , not seriously treated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bang show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the school time , as they loved ones like a bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really was very viol@@ ated .
when I was eleven , the children , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I felt really attack@@ ing , changing and disappointed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public they don &apos;t like to live her love : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people expect you to be a certain way , and that off@@ end me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps I will describe me a few , but I don &apos;t like to just@@ ify me before the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as a population of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you when I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; he added Justice .
&quot; as a coach I would say that it is at the time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before@@ hand a great announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice has not been the democratic candidate in Hill@@ ary Clinton .

CO@@ E lo@@ ys &quot; hon@@ est &quot; Russian Dis@@ charge for D@@ oping sc@@ andal
the worldwide b@@ oss of athlet@@ ics , Sebastian Co@@ e , fi@@ anc@@ ée on Thursday , what he described as an open ap@@ ologi@@ zing from Russia to a doping sc@@ andal , but he repeated , it is not the moment to be taken into the sport again .
Russia &apos;s athlet@@ ics b@@ oss Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the athlet@@ ics world championships that the array of his country was correct and that he decided to fight the doping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , which were taken away in competitions for gold and silver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban , which was imposed in November 2015 after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) references to the state @-@ sponsored D@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very hon@@ est presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has experienced itself , that they experienced some rather hot times and will do anything to ensure that the Federation is redesigned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E said he is also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accept the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress does not support the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we must do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes of the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
ninet@@ een Russian athletes are competing in the athlet@@ ics world championships , which will start on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Andersen , said on Monday that Russia will meet some of the criteria for re@@ com@@ promises .
thr@@ illing tests are still in@@ adequate and forbidden coach , he said Rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .

&quot; &quot; &quot; they called the two drivers but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Can her expert &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tend to have given us this highest victims in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old staff from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday in front of a week in West Africa .
her chair@@ men were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a lam@@ ination of the Bundes@@ wehr in the F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er Cathedral St. Peter .

sad@@ ness , they put down in the l@@ il@@ ies , with an arm in arms to the sin@@ ks .
in front of the church F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Defence Minister of the Le@@ yen was decorated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first six @-@ educated Tiger drivers have been built in F@@ ritz@@ lar and one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his reg@@ im@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Kom@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the Reg@@ iment , said : &quot; if this crew could not turn off the crash , nobody could have been mo@@ cked . &quot;
doub@@ ts about the UN mission in Mali showed not : the use of the Le@@ yen is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country , from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral service , the S@@ ew@@ ge were brought out from the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the German army made no information .
Prince Hen@@ rik I want no tomb beside his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife .
this divided the King &apos;s house on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .

the Queen may agree with the decision of her husband , it was further notice in communication .
where Prince Hen@@ rik I will be buried , is still un@@ clear .
but he did not know the intention to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a Com@@ mit that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to be king .
in 2016 he retired and lays down the title &quot; princ@@ ess . &quot;

the native @-@ Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French noble family , had learned Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French Embassy .
during his future wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always had to flo@@ at , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand at the Dan@@ es in his almost 50 years old .
in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did .
my Danish wine was s@@ lim@@ ming , I preferred wine instead of beer , soap fl@@ ang@@ es instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco , which had to be the reputation to be the brand of critical intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not trust in view .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were two mist@@ akes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Because I want a re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP prior to possible majority in Lower Saxony
defe@@ ating Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green governmental organizations for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he spoke to the Parliament &apos;s dis@@ solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising exit of the Green MPs from their land fra@@ ction in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election the red @-@ green coalition lost their kn@@ otted one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former green members of El@@ ke T@@ ry founded a step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its elec@@ toral circuit in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hannover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U @-@ Fra@@ ction Commander Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend it to its group .
these CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony &apos;s Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the ratio was vice vers@@ a .
the new Parliament will be elected on 14 January coming .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government now decide whether they could continue to rule in this situation without a majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan Weil , however , is holding an incur@@ able , however , is that the Parliament as quickly appro@@ ached its self @-@ resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on a further notice on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state of the national decision also provides the opportunity to escape the Prime Minister &apos;s Prime Minister and elec@@ ts a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be legally checked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will answer all the questions if they are legally checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens Step &quot; but something cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the politicians in themselves said : &quot; I am not a betra@@ yer .
I feel very good . &quot;
they called itself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called the ab@@ dic@@ ation dep@@ uties for return of their land meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are course of course that she has received her land at the green state list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared the President Meta Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group &apos;s president Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regre@@ t the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have decided to lead no interpre@@ ter in the Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the background , there was no content differences , we cannot draw this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Socialist candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the death of the Lower Saxony Green @-@ dep@@ uties El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behavior of the former Gre@@ ens @-@ members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal to the voters and voters , but also the Council of Red @-@ Green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the B@@ und@@ esch@@ ef &quot; s &amp; Ds on Friday to Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he under@@ stands the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re@@ locate the land quickly .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politicians in their last E@@ it@@ el@@ iness and their personal interests in their personal interests in front of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Sal@@ vation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty In@@ tri@@ gen@@ game and tries to beat out the political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

interview in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ ern , Lord Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses on sigh@@ ed eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect consumers .
Prime Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the editorial of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , how can the consumers protect themselves from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de presents the Länder the latest news on the affected eggs .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if we know what we are at present , health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of recon@@ n@@ aissance from the Federal State Minister is not really perceived ?
the food monitoring is the task of the states .
nevertheless , my house has to be switched without delay and have since dis@@ closure of Germany &apos;s data in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade is the same as the manufacturer to ensure that the products sold traffic and health are un@@ think@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if in eggs the resi@@ sti@@ ff content of 0.0@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not traffic .
however , the un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
these times are not the establishments .
are production farms and consumers in the same boat ?
according to the class@@ room , production farms will be no immediate debt .
in particular , they must calculate illegal practices of services with economic damage due to suspected illegal practices .
as always there is a little control .
is it missing on the staff or also on the s@@ ender jurisdiction ?
but there were just the official controls that revealed the process .
however , to the truth , however , food and criminal energy can never be 100 per cent excluded .
just therefore , a consistent adv@@ ent of such events and hand@@ over to the public prosecutor in cases , in which criminal off@@ ences can be submitted , of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made several times that I &apos;m interested by the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular alarm @-@ mis@@ m really necessary for food sk@@ ill@@ aries ?
consumer goods and consumers have the right to get certain safe and traffic food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de is used in the food industry , consumer goods and consumers will be emp@@ iri@@ cal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by the f@@ ancy funds , manufacturer , dealers and consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are not necessary to come in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de Fi@@ pro@@ il in the attitude of life expect@@ ation is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
it has to be consistently consistently and worked with high pressure on all levels .
I &apos;m expecting from all competent authorities that the atomic fact is un@@ profitable and dis@@ closed .

PS@@ G can cause the money to loose with security , that N@@ ey@@ mar will teach and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , given by the financing of the team through the energy @-@ rich ruler of Qatar .

the FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had received tremend@@ ous debt in their stre@@ ches after success , effectively fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ging and ris@@ ed , when banks or owner returned their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P conf@@ essed from the concentration to debts of their losses .
the change meant that the model model , the novel Ab@@ r@@ amo@@ vich originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then invested in order to build the team and to build a global stamp - at a har@@ der matter .
during the current three @-@ year @-@ old FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs may take losses amounting to EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the presidency to the un@@ gn@@ ade in 2015 , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to re@@ loc@@ ust@@ s up to re@@ loc@@ ust@@ s .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P isn &apos;t dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for the invoice about the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year treaty so that the sol@@ uble sum for the next five years can be submitted to EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 , PS@@ G collabor@@ ated with Abu Dhabi owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to € 20 million , and it was limited to 21 players in the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players .
the UEFA is in search for clubs who could try to super@@ vis@@ aged their income by companies that are connected to the owners of a clubs .
while a cat@@ ar@@ act company could be spontaneous if the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ship should exceed the default market rates , the UEFA dies would not apply as legitim@@ ate income .
exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ing of the PSA Tourism Authority re@@ pro@@ stit@@ ched .
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could occur in Qatar about payments of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar was con@@ tested that N@@ ey@@ mar World Championship will be simply to find out and such a new man@@ eu@@ ver for the UEFA regulatory authorities .
the current sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA is still atten@@ tive , any attempt to observe the rules .
the UEFA had no prepared talks with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars transfer , legendary on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they said under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated sales of € 54@@ 2.4 million for a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last fiscal year need to be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars arrive a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing De@@ als , merch@@ an@@ dis@@ ing and Tri@@ k@@ ot@@ c@@ ues .
the association continues to increase sales by at least 30 per cent after the signing of the signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated , one of the best soccer players to see , and attempted to prevent N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars way to prevent them that PS@@ G viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear@@ er case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial doping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in terms of cat@@ ars .
Arsenal @-@ Manager Ar@@ s@@ ene W@@ enger , whose association is owned by an American sport @-@ ty@@ co@@ ons , divi@@ des the order of La League against a state that financed an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has complete the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
it will be very difficult to respect the financial crisis Fair@@ play because they can do different ways or different interests if a country has a great actor , to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new Sch@@ og@@ g@@ il@@ ant

now the association is co @-@ operation before a possible end : the airline writes the order .
Swiss @-@ speaking Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed on request of the News Agency S@@ DA on request of the newspaper &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclu@@ de a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be reviewed and subjected to quality control every two to three years .
&quot; we are very pleased with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson .
some 17 million small red @-@ white p@@ og@@ ging panels to 14 grams spread a year &apos;s flight lad@@ der before the landing to passengers .
by the cost , Swiss does not want to make any information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; industry sectors estimate the order volume according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is all@@ em@@ ally of the advertising effect : for a bu@@ og@@ gi@@ ants , it is a prestigious order .
as many applicants in the new call , Swiss does not want to betra@@ y the Swiss Life .
but only Swiss manufacturers are coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the Treaty on the spring of 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturers do not reach a position on position for the S@@ DA .
cho@@ col@@ ates tables distributed the Swiss Life since 2006 on board their flights .
before Swiss had completed a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut is delivered in cooperation with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets .
the possibility to place the logo , launched two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .

blow against drugs Mafia in the country
the police has succeeded in blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart there were numerous objects , like the public prosecutor &apos;s office on Friday .
between 25 and 77 years of age , 15 accused were arrested and already issued warran@@ ts for these arrest warran@@ ts .
in addition , the civil servants set up major amounts of mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand Euros safe .
at the same Raz@@ or in Italy , two persons were arrested .
there were German warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two will probably be extra@@ d@@ ited to Germany .
in the action , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the members of the Mafia is de@@ emed to be de@@ crimin@@ ality , severe violence , attempted murder and rob@@ ber@@ y and fatigue .
already since the summer of 2016 , the public prosecutor &apos;s office has been determined against organized drug traff@@ icking in the South German area .
between the public prosecutor in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo a real exchange and investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had nearly daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the grand@@ use was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
in the Vis@@ i@@ osity of investigations , Italian national nationals combined with respect to Italian Mafia .
there was also a incident on 27 May in th@@ igh , where several shots were fired at a restaurant in the morning , to go to the bank account .
a way compl@@ ains large g@@ aps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ Register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; information from citizens who should not occur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : a report that the foreign register shows considerable defects in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this lead to partly engraved failure to asylum procedures .
the federal government for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has been atten@@ tive to a media report on large g@@ aps in the country &apos;s ec@@ centric register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short@@ com@@ ings of the data collected here could lead asylum procedures and shi@@ fts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to partly gra@@ ce@@ ful mis@@ conduct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an analysis that lies the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; South German newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the register , ten million people with foreign nationality are recorded , including approximately 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data will therefore be managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been well maintained , the data quality in parts have not been well maintained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from people who have long not been in life , or by citizens who are become German citizens and should not stop any more in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in@@ correct data , recur@@ ring processes can slow down significantly , &quot; it is the report to the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the statistics of foreign people the EU citizens are captured , who would not have to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , such false orders were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a deliber@@ ate debate on the handling of immigration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is therefore in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently started to return to Italy with a 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they travelled to Italy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this goes out of an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the New Zealand back@@ wards newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper , the B@@ AM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding families with children - except for infants and small children - after Italy as of June 1 , 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible , the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site .
after the Dublin treaty is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach them first .
when a mig@@ rant mig@@ rant into another EU country , this state can return him into the trav@@ ail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the grounds &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministry has now write : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the recording capacity for families with minor children in Italy has been considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy I submitted for the recording and accommodation of families guaranteed .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EG@@ M@@ R ) is sufficient for this commitment .
there were also other EU states to return home in the context of the Dublin @-@ agreement .
the &apos; Political spokesperson for the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ized this decision : &quot; families with children are threatened with children due to lack of defic@@ ien@@ cies in the Italian asylum system of human illegal conditions .
second best results achieved

at the same time Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher reported the actions that will be carried out in the spring of Ober@@ su@@ enbach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we generated the second best result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K rotary leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have been subdu@@ ed over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they held interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fied pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Bank Committee ( M@@ PC ) , with 6 to 2 , with interest rates on 0.25 % , whereby the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened its support for an increase in this month .
in its fourth annual inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 at 1.6 % , and the inflation would probably continue to rise to almost 3 % in autumn .
but it claimed that in the next few years of interest rate would be necessary to trans@@ verse inflation of Bre@@ x@@ it , and it said that the loan costs may be more than expected to rise in financial markets .
the members also voted for a part of the Mamm@@ alog@@ y @-@ economic par@@ c@@ ets that was published before a year after Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time for the financial plan to provide for banks , although it was said that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , since pressure on the real income of households continue to be charged the consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the interest rates , they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain stra@@ ction of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required when the markets are expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets currently projected the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank emphas@@ ized that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the revised growth forecasts for this and next year , the Bank forecast recorded 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to May 2007 .
it retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the Po@@ unds fell to these messages compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
the decision to no change occurs after the recent dis@@ appointing year growth pay the rising expectations for a interest rate of 0.2 % and the GDP has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover from the Bank at the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that become affected by an increasing inflation and minor sem@@ esters , because the disappearance is first even worse before it will be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy is not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent the income of income in the next few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they added that wages for the end of their three @-@ year forecast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pounds , which is compens@@ ate a portion of lower consumer expenditure .
the decision comes to a year after lowering of interest rates on 0.25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the fun@@ dus .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until the prices and the economy will be fully reached .
prior to the last judgment of the Bank , the call has risen to interest rates , since the inflation increased its pressure on hard , with the three political decision @-@ makers in July a rise to 0.5 % .
inflation fell to 2.6 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank predicted that this was expected to put on again in the next few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aims at the relation to its goal of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ unds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Co@@ rec@@ o mort@@ gage bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent recovery of the s@@ wap rate , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , as the credit card was looking to end in positive way and end the year in positive way .
the market looks very well suited for those where the existing De@@ als run and close the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) should rub against HIV drug killing 10,000 people
in September following a fight against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS , patients will receive access to &quot; trans@@ forming &quot; HIV @-@ prevention treatment .
N@@ HS England announced that there is a first three @-@ year study at high risk analysis by around 86 percent in front of the sexual intercourse , a first three @-@ year study for 10.000 people .
he declared himself to finance the trial , after the Appeals Court confirmed a decision by the Supreme Court in the past year , to pay the death of the N@@ HS in spite of the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was announced by N@@ HS England CEO Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was welcomed during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) as a &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first belong to the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October 2018 before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 .
pre@@ ex@@ foli@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xes ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV samples which are taken before sex to reduce the risk of a HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduced the HIV transmission in inf@@ ectious disease .
Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines in the body of a person is present to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who are coming to question are pregnant or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners that were not successfully treated .
in clinics , appropriate participants are identified to vote , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who controls a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment .
people who live in England and registered at a house specialist , can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is signed at £ 10 million and N@@ HS England , signed a contract for delivery of medic@@ ations in this week after an international competitive proc@@ urement .
the study is to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by using clinical evidence as well as in a large scale , recorded and implemented .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should add the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in relation to one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive Officer NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted for needy and endangered people , the possibility to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled , and not with a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to improve many lives of many lives .
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chairman of the Ter@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be conducted quickly throughout the country , and that no one who has a risk for HIV is dropped .
now , as the Pr@@ EP @-@ Test medicine has been abolished , we are on the best way to protect over 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
Sharon Ho@@ dg@@ son , Shadow of Health , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP @-@ trial is due to months of del@@ ays and hes@@ it@@ ated implementation by the government and over@@ due .
the evidence show how to trans@@ form this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transfer of these vital infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the Adv@@ ant@@ ages of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is to protect people as soon as possible in the whole country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that it will be responsible for the termination of the preval@@ ence of HIV in society .
the big life @-@ life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks this small Ear@@ ls Court Apartment is transformed into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed in 2014 from a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne @-@ terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their bags and sold .
&quot; I lived with my former in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court , and had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love me in love with this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first tour the 1.000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a scra@@ per layout - one had to go through the kitchen to go into the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne dam and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted to have high ceilings , large windows , a lot of light .
this was my request , &quot; says it .
for this purpose she commissioned architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi in Notting Hill , the 12.5 foot high ceilings and a home that was not just a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms to place each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine , in which one could be .
Er@@ fan had to think creative to solve the advance .
&quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so arrange that they had to be stacked on each other , without having to decor@@ ate us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only because to build a simple platform , but to put the steel that it had the right height at the top or down the right height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement made it possible to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine looks a classic copper cable from Retro@@ u@@ vi@@ us about the gl@@ am@@ our@@ ous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
on both ends , a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to leave him longer .
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units offer space for all the corner and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
by perception of a smooth space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
composite kitchens are nothing new .
so special about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a little engineering art came in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel ampli@@ fied , vene@@ ered MDF door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not important so that if you push the door , very easy gli@@ des &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a se@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form a real estate bro@@ ker and calcul@@ ating a calculation based on the floor size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they made it to enlarge the floor space and use high @-@ quality materials that make room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and the therefore help to create an emotional binding in a home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electrical sockets in walls .
these are important , but they &apos;re not playing with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be turned out by good design and increased square met@@ ering of something standard into something very aston@@ ishing .
indeed , such as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate in real estate
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nast@@ y , in a con@@ front@@ ation due to one of the largest real estate imper@@ ial Vic@@ tor@@ ias worth over 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton football club &apos; and developer Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors of his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and its business can be split .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family company since 2014 , but a sharp con@@ front@@ ation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers 38 real estate tot@@ alled more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family purchased a business in the Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
in there , the West@@ co family founded Je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio by De Lut@@ is now encomp@@ asses offices in the city centre , Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sorrento , the apartments in gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler , as well as shopping m@@ alls in the subur@@ b .
according to an agreement with her de@@ ceased father , Colin - von Paul is as the main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the family De Lut@@ is described - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul is about one third .
a judicial file promised that Colin has been property valued at $ 316 million and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has been proven for Paul as a result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proposed selection of Colin proposed for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place last Friday .
the brothers also strug@@ gling for control of the existing business - of which Colin , as Paul claims that it is excluded .
Colin argu@@ ed that this is not true , but raises Paul before , some owners in@@ competent .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was submitted by Colin , he says he hope to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of businesses , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both parties received the law firm .
Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants to operate the dairy bars and dol@@ ik@@ at@@ ess@@ ays of the late 1950 @-@ he and in the early 1970s an business in Brun@@ swi@@ ck bought .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , opened in Colin the first je@@ ans@@ shop of the family .
Colin says that he began playing West@@ co where he was &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul had a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she died and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to pass her ownership to her sons .
&quot; Luigi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi said often to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never wanted that the brothers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brothers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no more part of De Lut@@ is Group , whereby Colin claims that Mark were rep@@ aid at the company &apos;s 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Luke as well as Mark should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin has kept very back , although it was a former AF@@ L member board and after a biography from Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire of the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took in touch with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ on with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Colin responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad , that my brother Paul decided to make me to acc@@ use me and our family names by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not wanted that Paul and I would say in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope still hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be finished .
&quot; our aff@@ air will be redeemed in the near future of the dishes , &quot; wrote Colin .
tr@@ umps new Chief of Staff is planning to restri@@ ct the Media @-@ Ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if yes , he will be the first .
POL@@ IC@@ ICO reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restri@@ ct the information flow on President Tr@@ ump - including the reports of the news media - in hope to hold the b@@ oss on a consistent course .
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , on his first day of work with leading employees , he exhibited his first problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House which he rep@@ ented : bad information that would fall into the hands of the president .
Kelly said the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in mail@@ ings - because the President would make better cho@@ ices if it would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys Diagn@@ osis is making sense , but others tries to count Tr@@ ump to monitor them his media .
President Tr@@ umps long relationship has been back for decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV is still strong .
&quot; when Tr@@ ump was delayed because of a un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places , &quot; said the former campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February versus POL@@ IC@@ ICO .
Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key , tr@@ umps Twitter hab@@ it consists of control , according to six former campaign civil servants to ensure that his personal media consumption contains a continuous praise prize . &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tr@@ umps Twitter hab@@ it ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaigns are something that we don &apos;t know that Tr@@ umps T@@ we@@ et would have to contain more ignition fuel without their inter@@ ventions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will probably never know anything about the T@@ we@@ et which has not been sent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if his employees were already made several times , trouble of him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but nobody can prevent it consistently , that Tr@@ ump Kon@@ tro@@ scopy is concerned .
a part of the problem is that people in a white house that emerged from competing parties , will always try to present their own agenda by adding dr@@ ump materials that possibly promotes their views from the world .
POL@@ IC@@ ICO - a deal with this history - reported in May about the pre @-@ love of the adviser , the president of strategic reasons .
this was an example of described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press cuts , especially such with damaged Lec@@ tures , and that it can get out to get out where these come . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly that happened at the end of February when someone accused a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Pro@@ v@@ ok@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who gave the source behind a bun@@ ch to his Lec@@ tures &quot; in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Johnson has been banned from Twitter or ordered that he has not declared false evidence or ex@@ presses it in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sed Self , and his advis@@ ors still continues to influence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these un@@ changeable factors make a mission very difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mei@@ st@@ requested publ@@ ishers receive mail from Europ@@ ol
since the address is unknown , the Mi@@ th@@ inks of the population will pray and hopes .
the police in all of Europe shipped during the summer ( virtual ) postcards to hazardous crimin@@ als on the run .
since the addresses of the requested heavy cr@@ ates are unknown in nature are subject to information from the population and to pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europ@@ ol reported on Friday from the promotion , which follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; season from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experience had shown that many vol@@ at@@ ile on holiday dest@@ in@@ ations , it was called by the Council of Europe .
we have compiled 21 postcards for requested crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed .
36 of the online partners could have been arrested , at least eleven of them due to the release on the website .
travelers negoti@@ ate over a tr@@ ench and return to the &apos; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s series &apos;
some of the we@@ al@@ thi@@ est house @-@ owner of the West Mid@@ lands are again negoti@@ ated with some ent@@ an@@ gled traveler , which have been drawn up by the municipality , in order to demand a field before their houses .
the trav@@ ellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside a we@@ al@@ thy street from Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called &quot; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s series . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transport , after they had only been published in May , without being turned off by a Council of excav@@ ated tr@@ ench to prevent their accidents .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defense plants and pressed its vehicles by a section that remained un@@ handic@@ apped to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the inhabitants have op@@ ted the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; us@@ eless &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous residents said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went off on Monday evening after they have been sent back from Bentley Heath , where they have cast a stone on the fit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by Sch@@ am to the implementation in fact , because it was us@@ eless in dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trav@@ ellers were moved in May , and we moved back again .
more yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to move with long signatures to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my members , if the Council cannot stop it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a people who would not be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , we just have seen the last round of this journey only to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesperson for the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and working with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we are taking the necessary legal steps to continue as fast as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to support our knowledge collection , it is very important that as possible , as many people as a social or criminal conduct in the police , call 101 to call .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we propose our case . &quot;
made of Birken@@ hof , Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is from the former hotel Birken@@ hof .
the house in front of Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1st March next year .
that is good news for the city .
because with the closure of the hotel Birken@@ hof by the former amb@@ ience of the company mbH about 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 nights were lost per year and also revenue through the tourist tax .
in autumn 2014 , dramatic rising numbers of refugees who arrived in the county , the hotel building is offered as a collective accommodation for controversi@@ al discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers through the placement of a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ bach near Julian Oss@@ wald def@@ ended the hotel location and spoke of serious people at the same time .
he should keep right .
the group of Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and will make it again a home of the three @-@ star plus category under the name of Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter Object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ s and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
they are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the previous Hotel Birken@@ hof , a long time of building @-@ container has been placed before the entrance , and when you enter the house , the extensive renovation work will be made .
the floors were taken out , ceilings to the part , old bath@@ tub@@ s from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still a lot to do until March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it actually is a nice place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sch@@ erer says in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything is supposed to be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with large @-@ walk showers , the input range is redesigned , it will be installed new window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois Near &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer is supp@@ ressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room include equipment .
you don &apos;t want to be positioned at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ house , but is emphas@@ ized on an elevated city level .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms would have a wide rise , explains Sch@@ erer further .
both individual guests , groups or business units are supposed to feel at the hotel .
convers@@ ations with O@@ B Julian Oss@@ wald and Tourism director Michael K@@ rau@@ se he already led , so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are equal with those of the Hotel Group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer would not want to be exact .
just under one million euros , he calcul@@ ates .
the external plants are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible .
a large terrace , which is publicly accessible from the restaurant that will be publicly accessible .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. Com@@ er@@ ti@@ ler sets a Grand Jury
in Russia &apos;s aff@@ air to US President Donald Tr@@ ump is supposed to have been a so @-@ called Grand Jury according to a report .
the board took the work during the past few weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; under appeal to the thing .
the newspaper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
CNN &apos;s CNN reported that there is already first pre @-@ charges of the Gre@@ mi@@ ths in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ umps and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. secret services accused the Kre@@ m@@ lin since longer , targeted in the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines if there were abstra@@ cted between Tr@@ umps Election team and Moscow .
in the investigation of the investigations , several men are standing in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republi@@ can .
according to the report , Mu@@ eller also increased more and more m@@ umps private and business environment under the magni@@ fying glass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote some weeks ago that the special inv@@ ig@@ ator Tr@@ ump personally run into the centre and the alleg@@ ation , whether the president may have disabled the justice as part of the aff@@ air . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand jur@@ ies is to examine and decide whether the indictment should be charged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore called the Trial Chamber .
mostly they are switched on if it is greater and controversi@@ al cases .
the procedure is always closed behind the doors .
the board may also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to invite individuals to the hearing below .
according to CNN &apos;s CNN , pre @-@ charges were issued to turn around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and an Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meetings were asked to be asked about a statement , called it in the report .
Moreover , they should provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. had also been tr@@ umps consultant and son in law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam@@ al@@ ous elec@@ toral campaign Paul Man@@ a@@ fort with the discussion .
right @-@ wing experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the fixing show that Mu@@ eller should not be sh@@ y in his work , and that he should be necessary to act fast .
but it would not be inev@@ it@@ ably called that the Grand Jury should be switched on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment .
nevertheless , the integration of the Gre@@ mi@@ um of the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason to concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the middle of the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday evening a speech made in West Virginia to present the Russia aff@@ air as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the subject give the Democrats a way to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good because they cannot have anything else that they can talk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in a statement that he was ignor@@ ing of a Grand Jury .
but these things usually work in secret , emphas@@ ized .
the White House advoc@@ ates all measures aimed at accelerated the work of the special procedure on &quot; f@@ aire . &quot;
the former FBI CEO James Com@@ ey said three times that I would not be determined against the president .
there is no reason to accept that something has changed , it was further on the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had been fired .
because of this gro@@ unded , accus@@ ations had become loud against Tr@@ ump , who want to disability the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump brought him to an investigation of the investigations against the then national security adviser to Michael Fl@@ ynn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the president stands for the investigation under large pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the presentation of US media , the White House material collected against the special exec@@ uting and its employees .
that caused spec@@ ulations about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller are dischar@@ ged .
unlike an independent special council of Congress like about in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate aff@@ air around the later president Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller could be fired at the president of the President of Justice of Justice .
several trans@@ missions of both parties want such a step forward .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators were issued on Thursday legislative powers , after which the special procedure could not be released so simply .
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : gig@@ antic Eis@@ berg is based in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
in the West@@ ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gig@@ antic Eis@@ berg has solved almost seven times the Berlin@@ s from Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
this divided the Bremer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ W@@ egener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the spread over a B@@ illion tons heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometer big col@@ oss is well cast into the north and will probably be two , three years , until it melted .
it is 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres one of the largest ice giant , researchers have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
to what extent the climate change played a role in the crash of the ice@@ berg , is un@@ clear according to research information .
a total of 30 years there is a series of unusual sw@@ elling of ice cream in the region , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) .
according to many researchers , it could depend on heating .
the Kol@@ oss is now a part of Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is so far .
Sh@@ el@@ fe@@ is floating on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it always grows on the sea and ends regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula .
north of this Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ eder was the equilibrium of wax and break down some years ago .
a complete Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is torn there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
it dis@@ agree that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is at risk , because the front edge is never withdrawn as far as the front edge .
in addition , the ice @-@ sla@@ b below voltage and could be broken down , if at a key place a piece of break .
the melt of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level , as they swim in the water , make ice so much water , as it emerg@@ es according to the melting .
however , the loss of the scra@@ p rate indicates that the gl@@ ac@@ iers can go straight into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in a low degree , the British research project is to examine the Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is the fourth biggest Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is of Ant@@ arc@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
on the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters .
there it breaks there regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is a natural creature , and there is no direct connection to climate change , the ice @-@ sign comes into a endangered position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is the most far re@@ treat since the beginning of the record &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under scientists may be controversi@@ al if the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is now again grow or long term , and possibly together , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even though these researchers do not return to climate change over the climate change , so in the past decades , the ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula are broken down in the past decades .
this long wave of Ant@@ arc@@ tic stretches towards South America .
according to data of the British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
reduce the temperature increase .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have passed over the past 50 years by around three degrees , and count towards the areas where the temperature at the fastest stei@@ e .
CD@@ U wants pet price for the staff
because it is always difficult to occup@@ y free places , the CD@@ U calls to compete out of the employer to be more attractive .
shortly before the summer break , the Kre@@ ist@@ ag has 41 new jobs in administration .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .

some 620 applications were to be recorded in this year .
nevertheless , the circle further missing staff to cope with the targeted requirements and tasks .
at the moment we have not occupied the circle M@@ ett@@ mann as before 50 .
among other things doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG from the initiative and compete for the promotion of the trade in the management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration should work according to the desire of the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concept for personnel recovery and personnel development &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term concerns of professionals , but to meet future @-@ oriented applicants , means it is .
the overall concept should focus after inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ boots and include a training offensive , CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this is already looking forward to a good approach .
because the circle has to do with a personal problems that one knew earlier than that .
other towns advertise good officials and employees as well as more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the address is from a right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also comes to a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ conditi@@ onally , from the service .
so the highest time for actions so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , continues to go beyond the common request with his party .
he had a long @-@ term surprise in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a fine @-@ up surprise , when he asked the staff open publicly in question , and the other parties are bl@@ oss@@ om .
people want to be verified that all the possibilities will be verified out of the municipal work association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfactory solution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Kreis@@ Administration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be in cooperation with the unions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - perhaps also in cooperation with the urban towns - a pet cost &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , the CD@@ U , the employees and officials tries better to pay better than the tariff for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money if one changes into a higher level , oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle are increasingly grown in recent years .
only few weeks ago , new rooms had to be established , in which employees take care of the new pro@@ stitute protection law .
not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and county director Martin Richter have a problem : you have too little staff .
Italy gives the sound to NGO Mig@@ rants li@@ mp@@ s
in Italy , Italy has warned the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they may not continue to continue their operations with new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs sign a new code of code , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said the Interior Marco Min@@ nit@@ i in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ nit@@ is warning came a day after the Italian authorities had a boat of the German charity organization &apos; youth ret@@ tet &apos; , because their team worked effectively with human traff@@ ic@@ ers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has been operating only since one year in operation , refused to express the out@@ ings of the Italian state @-@ forest Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we &apos;re sorry that we can not operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge any alleg@@ ations that can be collected , after we have collected all the information and judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat from &apos; youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , has been monitored since October .
it is thought that his occupation of infl@@ atable boat migrants will be delivered to them directly from the hands of men who can drive them directly from men &apos;s hands , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one of these reasons , only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast took place , according to the acquisition of the state @-@ forest , whose content was published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected of dig@@ nity through the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue elements in the zone of humanitarian grounds and not from any other moti@@ ves .
under the code of code , boats such as I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must provide an Italian police officers aboard , who monitors its activities .
just three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously been declared to keep the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered un@@ necessarily , but they would not cause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their lif@@ ec@@ tives &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refused to sign the Nobel Prize @-@ winner Organization Medical Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ nit@@ i said that the number of migrants who came to Italy came back to Italy in recent weeks that the efforts to strengthen Libya &apos;s coastal waters and co @-@ operation with local civil clusters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for more discussions with Libyan Citi@@ zen in this month with Ch@@ ad , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who deser@@ ted those countries in hope of Europe .

there were three friends guides .
the accommodation at Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for touring .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour started on hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed look@@ out points , partly on towers , of which you could find far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the down@@ stream levels .

console instead of grass - Bundesliga , for e @-@ sport
sit Sport @-@ Stars in future before computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating through wind and weather on the st@@ adi@@ on@@ phases ?
fact : E @-@ sport has long since become a serious sector , become a serious business - large stars , millions fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages .
this also known the first federal lig@@ ations , which are increasingly committed in this area .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals to the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; we hope to insp@@ ire all new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says the Management Board of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is safe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are still several clubs to rise in this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup to compete against the Gam@@ er of various clubs .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or PS@@ V Eindhoven are qualified .
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has become an agency for virtual football players in the meantime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football must meet in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that the young people will continue to go into the stadium , &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , mainly the Asian , conquer the Asian region .
with celeb@@ r@@ ity e @-@ sport drivers under contract you could be present online by more often on these markets , when only once a year the Federal lig@@ aments was sent to Asia .
what is it exactly ?
during the E @-@ sport , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends &quot; , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or even the soccer simulation at FIFA to competition at competitive level .
as long as normal sports , Li@@ gen is established , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in the Asia @-@ play 2022 , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but are there any kind of sport ?
for many , the performance is safe and needy .
also Ingo F@@ rob@@ ous has also been dealt with the question .
for the professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because he is competent and many organic and physical reactions , which can also find in classic sport , for example increased heart frequency sequences , hormon@@ al changes .
it also need cogn@@ itive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console but also to exercise their body and keep your diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
F@@ rob@@ otic but also problems : &quot; doping becomes increasingly a theme . &quot;
controls are heavy through online games , and in the scene the structures of classic Sports .
the scientists claim the high integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
players are internationally active , that &apos;s like a large global family , there is no intercultural shirts .
a study of business consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the E @-@ Sport a fast growth in advance .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ship and large tournaments .
in three years , sales have to be 130 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the soccer Bundesliga , this is little . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is not far away from the other well @-@ established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant .
International are many countries already .
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez takes part in the US team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher invests in the e@@ sports competition Uni@@ kr@@ n .
even in Europe there is quite a lot .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a class@@ room , F@@ rob@@ otic says .
in the Netherlands and France , the soccer league / league clubs are obliged to set up a E @-@ Sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison to Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Management R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in nost@@ algia to fall , and the old times are to be clear , is not enough anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s therefore to keep the tradition of the club , but the company also set up the modern market at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digit@@ alised world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is none to hold fast that only in the football , as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics that Conrad Roy was sentenced to suicide .
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because they encouraged her boy@@ friend by texts and calls to suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind them and were exposed to death in five years .
Carter was condemned in June for neg@@ ligent murder of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My family is unbe@@ atable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until appeal .
she was con@@ fron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives were argu@@ ed that both she suffered from psychological illness .
in red tro@@ users and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in eyes , folded hands and down eyes , when they were condemned .
&quot; their actions have en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed Conrad Roy , &quot; said the State Law@@ yer to the Court .
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she has not taken over responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has no Reu@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; horri@@ ble circum@@ stance that they regre@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , he did not found that their &quot; age or tire balance or even their spiritual disease have a significant effect on their actions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a state prosecutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no day , on whom I didn &apos;t use the loss of my beloved Son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would like to be proud of me , and as I go with all , I try to bear in spite of all my pain which we will bear for etern@@ ity with us , for his sisters there , &quot; says it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy said that they would never be persecuted by the knowledge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they will never be able to participate in the wedding of her brother or a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not any more person to have , with whom I was together for my birth every day , it is a pain that I will always keep my life for my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case seems to place a legal incident since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to claim another committed suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbohydr@@ ate po@@ is@@ oning in a vehicle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case moved national attention to himself after Car@@ ters procla@@ ims that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; hanging up , spring of a building , don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages which she had sent in two weeks before his death , while he was with his family on vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in sight of his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing that you must do the generator and you will be freely and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy , ordered that they should take advantage of any press from the case .
the case has the legal opinion .
to the few , the Carter belonged to Am@@ anda Knox , who was convicted in 2007 due to murder in their British worker in Italy , before she was acquitted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Knox , 30 years old , published in Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter earned compassion and help , not &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ i : learn from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of the FC Bavaria
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ i was able to run the Audi Cup as captain , is no co@@ incidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ ams the Con@@ centr@@ ate Cup winner a large season to - Extra motivation .
anything else was there in his place in the cabin , that Joshua saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ i immediately , even if the additional clothing piece was very small .
but as far as far as far as far as far as the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , there was no Philipp Lah@@ m and also had no Manuel New New York , he made himself the divided ties to the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach does not have announced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ centr@@ alized Cup winner will be back after his first use as Bavaria @-@ Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the one could have better run better than 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the character of the Coach could also be so de@@ pressed .
not the eight years older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was chosen from youth games , deb@@ ug@@ ging and just from the holiday given professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a game guide but he has chosen .
sugar is distributed in love to those who want to have a lot of herb that you want to keep at La@@ une .
so those who has chosen , an heritage of Lah@@ m can only be used to use a small extra @-@ motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ imm@@ ich confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want to do as player : responsibility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was as mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
right behind , this is now his position , the white Bin@@ d on the arm did you rest .
and in all , K@@ imm@@ i worked in this start@@ up as the one who can take the ru@@ d@@ der in hand too .
he gave orders to direct the tro@@ upe .
he had the sight for all , while many others were busy with themselves .
Vid@@ al thus to play its lack of fitness ( fol@@ ate hard ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches allow me to connect to the services of the Asia @-@ trip ( actually only conditi@@ onally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sweet with that in their first performance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ h@@ kot
this is all very good .
Sü@@ le ran next to K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y before the def@@ ences , both ag@@ ated sou@@ ther@@ ly .
the nam@@ ach@@ erous Napol@@ i @-@ storm frequently did so bad@@ ly , moreover , Sü@@ le tried himself up a few times in the game building .
his colleague Rud@@ y was to say that the result was not so how we hop@@ ed for us . &quot;
but he also showed an ordinary performance at the Debut .
game storage , Tem@@ po@@ ison : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
like un@@ lived this Bayern world still for the new length , you looked at the game to the game .
Rud@@ y has not given an example in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs one or two , but intended for six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ i passed after a few cr@@ isp@@ y statements in the back of his new compet@@ itor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting proposition from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happens here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bavaria you need to win any game . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all this he has to do no more . &quot; &quot; &quot;

company satisfied with Rhineland @-@ p@@ fäl@@ ische Minister : economy lo@@ osed W@@ iss@@ ings Tempo
it was often inde@@ struc@@ tive , the relationship between the country and regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( green ) still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this is how more than a year , in which the new Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V request from a change in economic policy - and t@@ aps at the same time the old minist@@ ries .
Frank Nat@@ us , President of the Association Tri@@ erer Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing g@@ alle@@ ys the wishes of the economy that Lem@@ ke has blo@@ cked . &quot;
the biggest K@@ ehr@@ t@@ wende sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the connection of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stood in the priority list of the country now .
even this year , the ministry hopes to a planning process procedure , until 2021 shall be the building law .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the western coast of Trier , which stands in the v@@ ord@@ al requirements of the Federal Financial Market .
the aim is to take the route in December 2020 in operation , says Minist@@ eri@@ ke MEP Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees a sign to support regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( Chamber of Commerce ) Trier is trying to increase the wine of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate Label , to increase sales volumes in supermarkets and exports to the trend of German exports since ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing a open ear to people who want to establish a own company , lo@@ ys the I@@ HK .
the Chamber of Cra@@ fts Trier sees an additional inc@@ enti@@ ve for young apprentices , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
the premium income of 1000 Euros is planned for the subscri@@ ber classes and 2500 euros , if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the master training .
the hom@@ e@@ work list for the country remains long .
when the planned road construction is to create quickly facts , at the same time it will be the country on the necessary staff , Jan Glock@@ auer , chief executive director of the Chamber of Commerce Trier .
of 56 new engineers , the Wis@@ sing on the state of mobility are to be able to set up only 29 places now .
the I@@ HK requires more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
CD@@ U Fra@@ ction vi@@ ze Christian Bald@@ an extension to calculations of the Court of Audit@@ ors , the country invested more than 20 million euros less in receipt of state roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects to be a concept of the country , as it wants to resol@@ ve the specialised bil@@ ingual guide in the region .
he remains the previous full range of broad@@ band in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had been rated power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a score of 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about stock@@ holders and break@@ through@@ s .
ex @-@ Economic Minister Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting on the Supervisory Board of the wind farm Pro Wind .

Audi is supposed to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers view con@@ fron@@ ted with a return reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to upgrade the software to more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW &apos;s chair said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gives more intelligent options as drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or restri@@ ct diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday , that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
k@@ one of the companies described the company as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nit@@ ric oxi@@ des , em@@ itting the diesel engines , are considered as car@@ cin@@ ogenic , and may cause as@@ thma .
the cost of automotive manufacturers , plants to neutr@@ alize the neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles and are also able to install which makes it difficult to hold the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel will also be charged to ign@@ ore the powerful autograph@@ s and the signs of the problem .
the companies attemp@@ ting to avoid the error of Volkswagen to avoid the use of so @-@ called @-@ off @-@ devices , emissions regul@@ ate , but when a car was tested , but when a car was tested , but for normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ik was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is not present before delivery and may be submitted in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi to b@@ yp@@ assing the emission regulations in Europe , and an inquiry that focused on the United States was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the study could be heavily loaded by Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer carries over proportional to the operating profit of Volkswagen .

for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which is to get to the chin @-@ off wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what they say , it is strange to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ dil@@ lo . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Lav@@ en@@ del is threatened with climate change
he became a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender is due to the d@@ rought remin@@ ding the conditions and due to the diseases of the insec@@ ts , the scientists and survey@@ ed insec@@ ts , which try solutions to find solutions , great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert by the agricultural research institutes CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ en@@ del in Provence is effective because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change , who brought much less rain in the spring and in autumn much more .
this has impact on the lif@@ esp@@ an of Lav@@ en@@ del .
there is also a small Z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the Zwer@@ g@@ zi@@ ades , and with very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil is not only suitable for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also suitable for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long vegetable oil with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
to the solutions that are considered to be considered , include a better water distribution and slow@@ down the slow@@ down from the ground , but also the approach of plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dry environments .

the assassination of a journalist emphas@@ ises the growing threat in Mexico
the employee of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce meet usually on Wed@@ nesdays , in order to check out their plans for the most recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ al@@ oa by the organized crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ audi@@ ble drug .
but on that day , in the shade of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about safety .
it was told to them that it &apos;s important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what is saf@@ er : they are supposed to take their children with the office , which were the objective of an attack with granite , or at home .
security experts have written three words to a panel on the front of the room : enemies , Neutr@@ als , Al@@ lies .
they ask the Rep@@ orter , name for each column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ eptions , and ab@@ dom@@ inal sex .
there are drug traff@@ ics , politicians , business@@ men , journalists , who are suspected to stand on the salary list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there are no rest break from violence , and throughout the country the dead bodies are always more journalists : at least 25 , since then President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto according to attacks and thre@@ ats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries .
under the latter , their publisher and its inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , who co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest error is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of its numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
its lack is deeply received , although its presence is available everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , which show@@ cases his medium @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; . two repor@@ ter in the three hundred years , Aaron I@@ barra and Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez , bear T @-@ Shirts , which show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and repor@@ ter discuss their shared subjects , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although in 2010 , a special edition of the German Office was built to process the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee to protect journalists , only two criminal proceedings .
as for most thousands of murder , which are linked every year with drugs and organizing crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists will be only rarely before judgment .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still consist on to handle the violence of Sin@@ al@@ oa , although they are still ir@@ radi@@ ated , although the terrain is still sl@@ ated .
without information about the mur@@ derer , without righteousness , has the meeting at the discussion of safety , says I@@ barra .
&quot; it is very stup@@ id , to turn my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why we do not understand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced out of two men before his car and was shot at him for 12 times , probably due to the name of the newspaper - who is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 12th River &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius in his car went away and damaged in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to be free in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but about Val@@ dez topic is virtually nothing to silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the last year and the extradition of the United States in January was Sin@@ al@@ oa for one of the bloody batt@@ les@@ ions in the country , as riv@@ alled fra@@ ctions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it does not make anything that someone may be shot in Sin@@ al@@ oa any day or more people on the street or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is filled with ench@@ anted , two @-@ story Maus@@ ole@@ um for drug ch@@ efs who are bigger than many houses for the Living .
forget for one minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only one box has the control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes into the United States .
nevertheless , and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the haz@@ ards of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the bl@@ ame that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understanding contributed to the murder .
first published in February the publication of a interviews with Dam@@ o L@@ op@@ ez , a leader of the riv@@ alled cart@@ oning fra@@ ctions held in war with Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s sons .
this publication may have the sons of off@@ ended , the power members purchased each copy of the edition , as soon as she was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second error was to force Val@@ dez not to for@@ cing Val@@ dez , after the capture of another newspaper that had published the same story , to leave the country to its own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long survived that his friends and colleagues knew that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars involved with five colleagues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ al@@ oa , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without cause the po@@ ison of po@@ ison problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the time , the newspaper served a call for the cour@@ ageous and hon@@ est reporting , and sales and advertising took part .
repor@@ ter loved it to publish hard tre@@ ad investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication that they could read stories that nobody else was to treat .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee on the Protection of journalists in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , where he also led them .
he gave himself up voluntarily , that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ al@@ oa &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to take the task that falls to you as a journalist - either the or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why did you not tell what happened before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team measures Val@@ dez , the fun vo@@ gel that could curse as a harbour man , the friend who was gener@@ ously with h@@ ugs and Rat@@ attacks , a teacher that knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ama , the bar opposite the office , go and sit there at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was his love for routine his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced her to ask her own attacks in question as they can do their work on the best , and live on the life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t like to deal with their wives , their children , their children , their clean shops , their secret start and run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cen@@ sored and self @-@ ster@@ ity .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it is wrong , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real , said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; od@@ our a sense that can be deceived ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then the thing with Javier happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others say , are not as well as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cas@@ ks , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for security training , suddenly there were no cell@@ phones allowed . days before it became known that Spyware , which is sold solely to governments for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen sought protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a middle class of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half of the sh@@ ear , some of the repor@@ ters asked if these officers belong to the 50 per cent of the polic@@ emen , who said the Governor itself as not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it is months ago , since the repor@@ ter went to the mountain area where the drug de fac@@ to have been under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has divided three main stories .
there was the assassination of the brother of the former known Box@@ er Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ al@@ oa .
they also had a pos@@ pos@@ é to the state spending , which concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the govern@@ ors .
and there was a group that was in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word that it was ab@@ duc@@ ted or as it happened , so it was careful when it was time to write something in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local news from drug traff@@ ic@@ kers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a polit@@ ician , who ruled the reg@@ ent Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( pr@@ i ) , who ruled the whole century all political levels .
recently , several pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of corruption of corruption .
in Vill@@ ar@@ real bat the repor@@ ter , to write about previous inci@@ dents in this loc@@ al , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went out a military attack .
only a few months earlier , readers of Val@@ dez had previously regarded as the best informed source about kidn@@ apping .
&quot; previously we knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickn@@ ame &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body .
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to storage space for signs and st@@ ic@@ kers , dedicated to the Mor@@ de by journalists , because the employees have become something that they never expected : activ@@ ist in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez made a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist at the office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officers say , based on DNA tests that it is his .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in all the country journalists came to become stronger , having written in organized protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone away in Washington and tried to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the Governor of Sin@@ al@@ oa on the Day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to con@@ struct journalists and destroy them , because they have said the truth .
she has since then asked that she is again divided by the government , because it is concerned that their rage has viol@@ ated their objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico of organizing crime , involved in government officials and a uniform society . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ter will not only be killed by drugs , but also on the order of politicians and security forces , which inter@@ connected with the organised crime under a blan@@ ket . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has assigned more than half of the attacks on the police and civil servants last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you die , because they would like to hold the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ami@@ rez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apparently the mur@@ ders have a horri@@ fying effect .
no man forget the death of the B@@ log@@ ist Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as in the northern border of six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that allegedly signed by the Z@@ etas @-@ Cart@@ el : &quot; here am I because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones besides their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua following the assassination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ro@@ sl@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue , as El Man@@ ana from Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo according to the assassination of its Directors in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly prepared on the drug Cart@@ el with a console of the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists fled from their home country , or even from the country .
it is a pain@@ ful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they are still looking for dangers and search for dangers .
and sometimes they become known as the photographer Reuben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City was murdered three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to stay and continue working , it is a daily dance with risk @-@ risk decisions .
I@@ barra who wanted to be the poet who once wanted to ad@@ mit that the drug traff@@ icking will be troubled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already completed , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the office in front of the office and drank beer , when all their phones began to Sum@@ men .
a series of shooting with band riv@@ eting and security forces near Maz@@ at@@ lan had dead 19 confirmed the dead .
the war continued on how it was promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the Bord@@ st@@ kan@@ te , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed on the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens in the vicinity - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who stopped the guard to see whether they were in read@@ iness .
if they had fear at all , they did not show it .
among the mighty portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger is visible for all Sin@@ al@@ oa , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his mark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the same day was murdered at Javier , the practitioners was murdered , she asked to send them to the coverage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to sof@@ ten his enemies .
on the first sight , it looks like a statue , though also a sc@@ rap@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , researchers found that the first findings of the incredible Rhin@@ o @-@ Canadian mining workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were described as well as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so good that they could even determine that his tender skin was of r@@ öt@@ t@@ Braun - and they said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have had something of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ quiet past &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; held circular din@@ osau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered Art of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ behaviour condition has researchers who describe it as &quot; really remarkable &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic the ge@@ pan@@ cer@@ v@@ ulture is the best known fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Radio , when he was near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , on 21 March 2011 .
he met something to look out of the surrounding rocks in the Plat@@ forms , and decided to look more precisely .
F@@ ossil discovered by him in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to cover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy Erd@@ bl@@ unt .
after all of these hard work , the finished result is ready to be unveiled .
&quot; if you blind only a little with the eyes blind , you could almost believe that it was s@@ aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is too visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go to the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs specimens - the mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this plant @-@ car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res , although it is covered with a arm@@ or , probably resem@@ bles the car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the strong din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage in order to hide themselves from smo@@ ked , and used a sh@@ iel@@ ding technology that is known as counter@@ cre@@ mation that is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to avoid his enemies , experts say what it suggests that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creation from the family of No@@ dos@@ sier in May has made head@@ lines for the first time and now is now in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
if the researchers have studied the wild animal , and it is Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ echni@@ ker Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of the specimen allowed it to include the Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and the form of sheds and arm@@ or on his body .
they discovered the contro@@ vers@@ ation , a common defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side .
although the con@@ sh@@ aded is usual , the results are surprising because the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta exceeds that of the today living creatures .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs of sufficient pressure was promised by the din@@ osau@@ rs of din@@ osau@@ rs , the evolution of the con@@ front@@ ation as a means of survival benefit .
but most contemporary animals , who are using the contro@@ vers@@ ation , do you think of edges , Zeb@@ ras or Gür@@ t@@ animals - are much smaller and viol@@ ate as prey that this No@@ dos@@ sier was exposed to a real struggle for survival .
&quot; strong cat@@ chy behavior on a massive , strong din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous to have been the din@@ osau@@ rs of the chal@@ k time , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs was red brown .
scientists still examine the animal to hin@@ ts about his life , including its ser@@ um dar@@ ling , to find out what it has eaten its last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , was put into a river and was cast into the sea , where he sank to the sea .
at that time Alberta was as warm as south fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much more inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs is really remarkable because he is completely covered with preserved skin , but also in three dimensions remains and the original form of the animal hus@@ band@@ ed , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost like in the early chal@@ k time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ design it . if you &apos;re just a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when giant Ther@@ op@@ oden , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , the earth moved out .
though the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , was ge@@ ared to din@@ osau@@ rs by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this includes the Acro@@ can@@ al@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11,5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings in the journal Current Biology appear , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta has been sank after the death of the sea and in mud m@@ um@@ i@@ fies .
the creation was found by Sha@@ wn Radio , when he was close to Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , on 21 March 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the preserved din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the th@@ igh .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips consisting of his shoul@@ ders .
the researchers believe that the pan@@ de@@ hydr@@ ate vegetable gro@@ ove was w@@ asted through the Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river to the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ rs keep his arm@@ our in exquisite detail detail .
the remains of this special specimen are so good that the skin is still preser@@ ving the din@@ osau@@ rs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko written for National Ge@@ ographic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is such a level of conservation such as &apos; sel@@ dom in lot@@ tery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more I see it , the dis@@ illu@@ sion@@ ed it becomes .
the rem@@ n@@ ated balance of the skin still cover the hol@@ iness plate , which bear the skull of the animal .
his right foot is on his side , his five fingers are split up .
I can count the sheds on his sole . &apos;
at the th@@ under@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age on A8 : many injured
severe accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a massage ar@@ ed@@ age .
there are numerous injured , mile @-@ long st@@ aves - and G@@ aff@@ er .
at the Autobahn Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , on the late morning of Thursday afternoon , 20 people were injured .
according to the first information of the police against 17.00 hrs between the junction of Adel@@ zh@@ ausen and O@@ del@@ zh@@ ausen ( County A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a ge@@ wit@@ ters almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also lor@@ ry , in@@ hal@@ ted .
about the exact number of the last deposits did not initially any information .
it was light up to moderate injuries , a poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big charge of rescue vehicles was at the accident point . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a roughly ten @-@ kilometer long back@@ log was formed .
like a AZ @-@ repor@@ ter , it also came on the out@@ line to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade recorded the label of the vehicles that now have more sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 there was a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it was a coll@@ ision between an Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spor@@ tive and passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group testing &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone experienced once : nothing sits in the train and sleeps .
or it is deeper into his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ered .
the Schaff@@ ner and we@@ ave an un@@ gently or irrit@@ ate the g@@ ast in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control control .
but the periods of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing device control .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you have taken its place and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
it is currently running on two routes .
&quot; coming on the offer , we have it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available at the beginning of the year on many other remote control circuits in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is the train the ticket production stand@@ ings without Schaff@@ ner .
to use the use , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to booked an online ticket - what is already most passengers do .
it is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator app , what is the most comfortable way of ticket booking .
and last one needs a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; convenience check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works as follows : you will rise in the train , call his ticket &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the test customers the button appears to be an electronic release .
the train manager got a message on their mobile devices that the g@@ ast X is located in the train and the booked seat is Y .
the train manager in the ticket check control in place Y knows that there is a passenger with already evaluated online ticket .
you can continue to continue , continue , continue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train - which again use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; whoever wants to travel without Ticket@@ control by our train staff , check in the DB Navigator simply .
this enables passengers to design their travel time in the train of personal assistance , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management Board of DB correspondence .
second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs . &quot;
those who often travel , knows that in addition to delay and missed the ticket cards are among the greatest doctors .
for often , in any case , however , one of the participants does not need all the documents that you need to use online tickets .
either the credit card or identity document or otherwise an document needed .
the sequence are endless discussions between train att@@ endant and passenger , which leads to bad mood during the part or major event and del@@ ays at the end of the time , taking the Schaff@@ ner at the end of the time to take care of others .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
this is also only available on connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
more access numbers on the same distance are not available after un@@ locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how one activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken by her core .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis Prayer on the bed of a Air@@ b@@ n@@ b Bedroom , which they rented and sc@@ roll by Facebook on their phone .
they are proud of a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has just killed an 18 year old child , and there is still on the street &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; called it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
conf@@ used , since no one had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah is constantly informed on their tim@@ eline .
the R@@ apper from the region of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed live .
he posted an image of Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body that was stretched out on the road and would stay four hours there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he thought Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was for them and their community nothing new .
she placed her mobile phone , to return to T@@ we@@ et on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive on evening .
there were photos of police band and people , crying out , and from a man who had claimed to be my Brow@@ ns father , who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ ons Police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they observed a live feed where a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ ine dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she assured a lot of polic@@ emen and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ ust@@ omed to us and which we can name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this moment I felt Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ st .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
they booked a return flight and went home on the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinema from the 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , the love and the losses , the strength and the power of resistance , which consists of the vision of men who are living in community and have filled the streets to request answers .
when Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who brought a cau@@ lif@@ ter and a matching crown , carried the two a conversation , which they had countless times before the morning &quot; on the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we go now to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy , and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be taken into it .
it must be well developed , not just acti@@ vis@@ m and organization , but also know the various layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do to liber@@ ate ourselves .
even if I have lucky enough to give you a experience that they personally experienced no ek@@ lat@@ ants , it is not different than the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling I would give you a bad service to keep them far off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first stop when they arrived in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , one place on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , one place opposite the police authority , which was at a camp site , when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter have joined together with a local business owner .
they prepared bags and add them to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly , a new kind of acti@@ vis@@ m for Fer@@ rell Mis@@ se began .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m changed after 9 August totally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of Min@@ ority Student N@@ course Association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was concentrated on eating justice and health in@@ equ@@ alities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in the organ@@ izers .
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later he met Fer@@ rell during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted only &quot; document , &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you be documented , or tries to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these Sk@@ ep@@ sis has been nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from White - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and their resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared : &quot; we heard that people who were born in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field which is known for his acti@@ vis@@ m rum around To@@ dest@@ al @-@ occup@@ ants .
his engagement brought Fer@@ rell the project closer , along with six other native loc@@ als followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we speak Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people will be represented , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the target was not to concentrate on Fer@@ rel@@ ls experience - to show that it is not the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Messiah &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement , but for a community , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; who show documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; sur@@ prisingly personal aspects of fer@@ ing lives , as she loves and married her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when they saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that in this work , I have to give a number of injuries to the black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls History repeated the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement .
two of the three fo@@ unders of the movement , which have marked the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in 2012 , have marked the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried out the movement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we are strug@@ gling with different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
black , sw@@ ule women must bear the main load of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; fol@@ ay@@ an voted to remember that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; active type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the Fer@@ rell has been selected as the heart of the film &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no co@@ incidence , although it was on the front , because in a life of these cruci@@ ble than a black , pregnant woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news of the news of Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on have disappeared from Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , but the racial connection between the congregation and the police continue .
Fer@@ rell is on proof for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the soci@@ etal atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos &quot; .
nevertheless , she ple@@ ases to a singing and she felt at this memory , since they went on Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on for three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love one another and support .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; Or@@ w@@ ahn &quot; : TV reader discuss about bit gallery
the bit gallery moves human beings , although it is not yet built .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the southern edge of the pedestrian zone has been split since the first presentation of 2009 the population in fears and opponents .
cold is hardly any kind .
also on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg , &quot; the theme is discussed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one @-@ to @-@ art gallery say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would not need a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ ose ) or quite clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the advoc@@ ate that there is a gallery more customers in the city , of which also the other shops take advantage , fear the adversaries , that then the pedestrian zone will be bl@@ ended .
the gallery is planned : the gallery is planned exactly on the property , in which 13 direct products will offer their products .
the construction work will be at the beginning of the construction work .
the Gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall into the new building - namely , for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit down outside .
Simone rooms : &quot; we &apos;ve been buying almost weekly in the pe@@ as@@ market hall for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farmers are very happy again .
also the but@@ cher was discovered for us .
we would like to wish that , during and especially after the construction of the gallery , we would have a chance to set up this offer .
in other cities there is also that .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; if direct market is located in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the amount of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new project is probably not really low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva Kil@@ ic : &quot; what is the most commercial in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , thr@@ illing or supermarkets : I find the su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are already enough in our city .
one can see how many shop stores are empty here - some for months and years .
but there &apos;s not once again a regular weekly market , it is more important that us will remain at least the market hall .
because after all , the goods offered are fresh , is mainly offered directly from the producer and is final .
as you can see , shop stores are rented in a shopping mall only from larger firms , because the dor@@ m rentals are often not tra@@ gic .
too bad , special transactions are almost no longer and what still remains of it , will probably even disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ trade : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the pe@@ as@@ sign market during the construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even on duration if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does it create the gh@@ ost bit gallery before , all shops out of Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that is simply not functioning .
and shopping center , which stands empty , nobody needs no one .
my opinion , after it would have been better to promote a real farmhouse market , instead of that gallery .
but there is no place for a farmer hall thanks to the mad many - how I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess building projects in Bit@@ burg no room more .
if the pe@@ as@@ sign market is made , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost infinite - that hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ iter and Haar@@ lem , which were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence analy@@ tics had a 35 @-@ year prison sentence , after they publicly made diplomatic information on the site of Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
the new exhibition that was opened on August 2 , means A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was transformed into technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a transaction and ground@@ breaking dis@@ sidents whose convic@@ tion was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been extracted from the algorithms that was extracted from Mann@@ ing , and that some intellec@@ tu@@ als could not only be interpreted using these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways , how they can interpre@@ t and the in@@ firm@@ ities determin@@ ants of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but since their pu@@ ber@@ ty , was openly spoken through the identification than woman , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the sp@@ ion@@ age law , computer and theft .
through the prison their image was supp@@ ressed , so much that it was only one photo - a grain @-@ white , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing sits un@@ comfortable on a driver seat and a plat@@ ine bl@@ onde is associated with it .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg returned from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in it , the artist &apos;s portrait of strangers origin@@ ates from for@@ en@@ ic ar@@ te@@ facts such as cigarette smoke and chew@@ ing g@@ um , extracted from the waste in order to produce a picture of how people could look like .
that was at the time I received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; declared De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they could not visit this time and could not be photograph@@ ed , therefore , they took contact with Chelsea and asked whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
in the course of two years , the artist and its imprisoned M@@ use were inter@@ viewed by several letters in the course of two years .
they even illustr@@ ate one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ orted Images , &quot; which was fore@@ seen a future in which the President Chel@@ ate Jud@@ gment and it would be able to see the exhibition personally .
in fact , Obama was actually only few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing release after seven brutal years in Kansas , he was a welcome type of lucky meeting .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and star@@ red , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against Trans@@ fron@@ tier troops to find new , twe@@ aked ways to find the rigid circuits , which he should actually fix it to fl@@ ames .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , following the strange tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen to a given reason . &quot;
in one of the gallery , the artistic statement called for Mann@@ ing with its superior signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name is equipped with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic collapse , the foundation of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall , their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is an exchange of Cs and Gs and As , in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , hop@@ ed by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or Nu@@ kle@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , such as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological ways , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what do we hope to take care of that our gen@@ ome does not care for a interpretation and how sub@@ jective they are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , track Mem@@ ories is also to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition that is kept in an own room is a page from the above mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as she appeared with a free release in hand from the discipl@@ ines of the United States , such as King Kong @-@ Hong Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they put up your words , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never even stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist which gre@@ et out from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still always looked , if I speak about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition - as it was predicted in the Com@@ ic book - but when it was supposed to do it , then it will be gre@@ eted in the middle of the room of mas@@ ks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulation , which were together as hor@@ des of Protest@@ ants .
that was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , who were written with the genetic h@@ ap@@ t groups with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , I had at the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement , which was formed with Chelsea , like the movement , also behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and a employee at the University of Oxford for murder
a nationwide human @-@ hunt is in G@@ ange for a professor at North@@ western University and a employee at the University of Oxford which had been considered susp@@ ects after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts issued on murder because of her alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au as shown by Cook County Court .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several bul@@ ls passed away .
one by the Chicago Department of Chicago published a joint warning system that the cor@@ ks was discovered on the 27th of July .
civil servants received a call , came at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still explained on the site of the events for dead , and det@@ ec@@ tives examine the bul@@ ks as murder , while the police are actively looking after the two susp@@ ects .
L@@ ath@@ em has been a professor for micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for the university relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation , L@@ ath@@ em is now true and be excluded from entering the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case that studied by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker at the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail explanation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help US investig@@ ators in any memor@@ able way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want to speak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
chief Communications Officer of the Police Office of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said the susp@@ ects that susp@@ ects the susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has an idea of its residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the susp@@ ects .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , the police had received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building which had just received a nice tip that had just happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene than very cruel .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said it is un@@ clear , whether the incident happened on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Management team of Grand Plaza published a statement on the residents : &quot; the police is currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of op@@ i@@ ves , including a variety of moti@@ fs , including a possible domestic approach . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Vice President Mut@@ ko
Russian Viz@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for restoration of the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of fulfil@@ ment of the criteria of the road@@ map R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA chassis was updated in this respect , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the schedule of the WA@@ DA in compliance with the Code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ restoration of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organisation &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain any concern for a concern regarding Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , he added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping authorities have approved the results of approval by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren , publicly sponsored di@@ op@@ ings in the Russian sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we lead the investigation into an error since our anti @-@ D@@ oping system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not tell anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os words agree with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the director of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with Russian sales office R@@ sports at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v answered problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping organizations , but then said : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report is controversi@@ al positions and regulations .
no one has added to accept this report un@@ conditi@@ onally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added . &quot; &quot; &quot;

start @-@ ups that will help your company will not be used to the next U@@ ber
Amy Sal@@ t wanted to measure the happiness at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
responses were often v@@ age , little helpful , or even worse - fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ently .
and even if you promised an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers do not mourn before the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply never gave consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Madison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was called people from the outside .
a new race of the Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at the wax to help enterprises find out how their employees feel at home .
through the compilation and licens@@ ing of software , which enables the specific purpose of the measurement of the employees , it enables companies to help , speci@@ alty groups and demo@@ graphic groups allow to handle speci@@ ality , speci@@ alty groups and demo@@ graphic groups to handle the C @-@ Suite exec@@ utives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools used by companies to measure employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
salvation said that they have a better insight into what your staff think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the sn@@ ap @-@ pol@@ ls and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance that units have most complaints and what exec@@ utives will have low state results - so that you can drill .
the company will be able to see that at the top of the workplace culture , you have not been involved in Sk@@ and@@ ale where a former staff has published a blog post , which describes a environment of har@@ ass@@ ations where those who have spoken is punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish has an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business option .

Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ gence , the company helps prevent bad behavior and to detect , saw a rise of interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit
Conver@@ tible has almost 600 clients , including air@@ bags , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber signed up recently as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ ting Company can send tail@@ or @-@ made &quot; Pul@@ s &quot; to view confi@@ dential answers in real time and watch the warmth cards of your problem .
there is also an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with the employees .
and if the main business guide is involved , complaints are directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has recorded the reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that his staff is bad@@ ly treated or un@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience co@@ stly consequences due to consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , employee fluctu@@ ation and pl@@ agues , Quin@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25,000 people and over 500 locations , does Conver@@ gence for more than one year , to ensure that people are aware of politics and procedures , and a simple way to reach their company headquarters .
previously , when an employee was asked to report , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the headquarters , a formal appeal , and hope that he was serious .
it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good possibility to pursue the complaints of employees .
now , since the company Conver@@ tible , problems may be identified by exec@@ utives , who were previously identified in offices in cities or countries , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ lau@@ ght intern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 degree view over the experience of employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who direc@@ ts the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal disputes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began , Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es engagement in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Andersen conducted for eth@@ ical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it took to their right to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that businesses could not prevent that you could not prevent their dirty clothes online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology for monitoring the Eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ ting offer your software as a service , and damp@@ en the company with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that you can find the approval of Venture Capital investors who support both start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ ters received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , increasing the capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ es secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex in research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more jobs to expect more than before .
in competitive markets such as Sil@@ icon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only .
the staff want to have the feeling that you are accepted and estimated that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the people are glad to feel in a company , that the work which you do is worthwhile , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its , and S@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which both Conver@@ tible and G@@ lin@@ t is used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach R@@ end@@ ites when their portfolio company run well . companies run well when people are employed and engaged .
if the analy@@ tics tools offer third parties to increase commitment and use of employees , there is no wonder that you can find support .
the data on employee engagement is important according to the experts of the workplace culture .
but the data are us@@ eless if the administrator of a company will take no measures .
in fact , if a company asks people after your feedback , it can have a expect@@ ation that change in the way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if the change is not fast enough , or at all , this cannot be dis@@ appoint@@ ments and employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have to ask about 4,000 suggestions , you have to have to have 4,000 convers@@ ations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , the company has seen themselves to leave the collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you take care of this ?
and who doesn &apos;t care that why should I take ? &quot;
Madison Reed , which now run a monthly employee surveys , was able to open measures in the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , deliver@@ t .
and after the gathering of the feedback of fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to organize several teams within the company and to add several teams within the company to tackle the problems .
at Ruby Tuesday the company gets more insights over the staff , and it hopes that for a long sight , this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector , which is known for high sales .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose man , you lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose your company .
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood
it goes on 23 o &apos;clock , as a lot of U@@ CL@@ A @-@ Foot@@ ball@@ ads on one side of the new training fields of the team on campus .
some have gone out their tri@@ angular parts and show the back full of silence from the first day of training camp .
a lunch break for a good part of the team .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses are returned to their final inspec@@ tions , before they return on the next morning at 6 : 30 am to the Water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the next three days a real tac@@ tile , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ t @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ CL@@ A should begin at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the already fully packed periods of players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than one day after the brood post@@ pon@@ ed to the beginning of the Camp@@ s almost a week after the last season , during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are supposed to be kept in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the beginning of the formal game prepar@@ es for its pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he would support the change of the N@@ CAA support , even if they add a further point of routes of the player .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we lay this enormous load on three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply supp@@ ressed , they pl@@ ung@@ ed , they are great men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think when we come back to Saturday and we have more time , it is really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end their practices as soon as the camp is terminated , which is considered the clear sight of its fields of an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of elevated class , which is already known with foot@@ balls , which will have no easy task .
Bru@@ ges players should occup@@ y the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a dre@@ amed that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far off to think that people can rent a room there and then set up there for a exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video and of an exercise , it is a pretty good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best , with what we have .
I &apos;m not doing so much too great .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential items with false messages from third parties and their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight against f@@ ake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated mach@@ ined learning methods to detect possible false messages and examine it to fact that the result of the fact test results from the original article will be displayed .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the key points for so @-@ called F@@ ake News , of which many believed that they also affects the US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem is also become a major political topic , whereby the French voters fall into force in May with false stories , and Germany is supporting a plan to eliminate h@@ asser@@ ed posters like prior to the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook told us in a separate explanation in German that in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review will be started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next to the knowledge , what stories of the third parties are challenged , people want more context to meet well @-@ founded decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in one blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues its feature to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; testing the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the connection below &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to other changes to his messages feed to reduce false messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a com@@ ic novel : a Castle in the History of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squ@@ e@@ eze music video and was a gor@@ ge for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ he years .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced a tur@@ bul@@ ent history of his comfortable seat in the Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now available for inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ hair@@ y Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ k@@ man with a pre @-@ love for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is so beautiful to look at the manuscript from someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; moved the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney - Isaac steering ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on a archive : it is written in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was an unexpected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have only re@@ acted on the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter that was written for the Jacob@@ ins in the 1700 &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b pressure !
and they smell not smell as smoke , because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light .
for someone who lives for 300 years later , the smell has an effect than he himself would be .
I , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who struck with old pap@@ al that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be hon@@ est , I have a little over@@ rated &quot; ) seems to be true to be true .
Rho@@ dos spent his days to explore the Vic@@ tor@@ ian &quot; new &quot; Castle , expl@@ oring the archives and had spent many treasures and cur@@ i@@ os@@ ities of the castle , such as the mon@@ te hy@@ lands of the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tr@@ ench .
he emigrated through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with land@@ sc@@ ari@@ ous , g@@ ain@@ ees , and sometimes with the artists who worked in the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received the full access until 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived one decade later , the employees were just started to take care of the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which arist@@ ocr@@ ats told &quot; Oh , &quot; described it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Emp@@ ires , maps , which represent what it had said : &quot; you could mean that country conflicts would be bor@@ ing bor@@ ing , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch , around the two families fought .
guys , let all go away ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to join the wider base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; which is a man , who left the newly built castle to join the farmhouse of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot who entered the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famil@@ ies of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; Rho@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the farms began in this area and I thought it was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the two are connected together ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which told the story of the Jesu@@ it Pat@@ tern , who hidden his family in Dar@@ rell seven years .
or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell ten@@ dered his own fun@@ eral , he filled a s@@ nat@@ ch with stones ( a discovery that was only two years later when his Sar@@ g was du@@ g out ) .
the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ l@@ emen seemed appropriate cheer@@ ful G@@ aun@@ er , always again debts and make money for things that they could not aff@@ ord .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men sol@@ es their debt crisis by giving rich old women - I place them as a bun@@ ch of well @-@ looking boys , with a talent , to advertise on inheritance . &quot;
after the end of its application in the castle Rho@@ des in search of other unique write @-@ experience
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about El@@ em@@ än@@ m@@ ä@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ atorium in the early 20th century , which has since been demanded by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back again , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be finished with the dam@@ sel lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the cover of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city Bad Honnef last Friday its campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team by Nelson Art@@ z will hold the logo and slogan for the slogan .
at the end of August it is to give a highlight of the campaign on the island Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; go to nice for us .
or ? &quot; questions the makers of Aktion since yesterday at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel since yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we think that ( of course ! ) do not think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write it on her yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and in order to make clear that man@@ ches are better than it seems .
basically , we are the firm that we know as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the promotion , more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is considered to be a common promise to form an un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able unique setting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally it up in the competition with other commun@@ es .
a mid @-@ digit amount is the city Bad Honnef last for its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an fear of the Army
every year at the beginning of August , in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) talks about retirement and convey@@ ors in the officer .
so this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the session found no more in the buildings of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office of the prime minister .
on the presidency of the Government , the presidency of the Government now also participated in the five Vice Premier@@ s as well as the Minister for Defense , Interior , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
so the civilians were in the Y@@ as in the surplus .
the government attrac@@ ts the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the He@@ eres , the Air Force and the Navy were depos@@ ed .
since the failed cou@@ p , Head of Head of Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of 326 Gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the rows of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as wire @-@ saving of the coup attempt .
against 486 people , which have been involved in the coup attempt to have been involved in Ankara , is negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup attempt , Erd@@ og@@ an had called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divine gift &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he give him the opportunity to clean the forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but has Erd@@ og@@ an the army really in handle ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hur@@ ri@@ yet published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ be@@ hagen in the Military @-@ headquarters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the general stick it give concerns a concern for an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which means among other things in the repe@@ al of the head of the case , the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the large cle@@ aring in the Army and the security forces in any case continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ og@@ an sent an additional 73@@ 95 Heads of State , including 230@@ 3 police officers and 546 soldiers .
it seemed as the ground was t@@ amed on the military .
the gener@@ als became more than the actual gent@@ l@@ emen of the country .
in three times they came under appeal to their role as a gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the world@@ ly state rules .
following his election victory of 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an promoted the power of the military step by step , not least in calling for the reform of the European Union .
former officers say , Erd@@ og@@ an inv@@ as@@ ure targeted a Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; magazine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a non @-@ called officer who sought refuge for asylum in foreign country abroad , the Turkish army in a few years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it affects , such a development could not be cold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no doubt in the alliance after cleans@@ ing doub@@ ts doub@@ ts of the use of the Turkish army . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership structures and oper@@ ation@@ alised skills are &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card

the Asc@@ ent of Sex Rob@@ ots is real , and we should make wor@@ ried about
just as you thought it could not be crazy in 2017 , a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots .
Yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we need to start their asc@@ ension .
customers can choose the eyel@@ ids of the robot , its shape of breast canc@@ ers and the type of fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people make them funny , but the company deliver every quantity of it , and we will still get much more frequently to see , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Shar@@ key in the publication of its new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ o have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin , which feels warm - with consci@@ ously human reactions , which can be achieved through artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also adjust the robot in accordance with its belie@@ fs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and everything you can choose from the eyel@@ ids of the robot through the form of breast canc@@ ers up to the type or colour of its f@@ ing@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it will still be troubled because many robots have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person@@ alities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have been progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ o have developed to rob@@ ot@@ ers with a silicone cu@@ ti@@ cles .
the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot allows users to custom@@ ize its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics , such as in@@ ti@@ tern@@ ity .
and then there is still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed person@@ alities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of ti@@ red@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality which is as good as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so you like what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
it has also been in the course of the day - quite as true men !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it may be we@@ ary , fixed to conversation or can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the atmosphere &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many un@@ mist@@ ig@@ ating aspects in this rise of sex rob@@ bers - not least because they replace real human relationships , but the sub@@ divided female properties that you encounter a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is here : resi@@ sting ) Far@@ rah , un@@ pleasant one in most .
in his website , true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibration why you can &apos;t have a Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not only a fat or content just another Sex@@ ual Toys .
their emergence or increasing refin@@ ement show a little dar@@ ker and deeper understanding of our culture , on a withdrawal from the Ideal of Gender Equality , a wish to treat sex with sub@@ jection to an optional en@@ core .
most of course , there will be no sex robot , and while the FR@@ R re@@ members its rising popularity , they still remain provisional on the edge of consumer culture .
but what kind of mar@@ g@@ inal zones may be per@@ ished in relation to the Spirit of the time , in which we live , very instru@@ c@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or ins@@ ul@@ ting , until they are the free market for this purpose .
there is a certain over@@ cutting , that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a period in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which the White House gives a pre@@ h@@ ed to have sexual violence against women .
the most terrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the ma@@ id@@ servant &apos; ) are not the graphical pictures , the un@@ locked body and the extinct eyes , but as realistic this vision .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump but it does not feel like a big jump .
the goal behind this sex rob@@ otic exists , a physical simil@@ arity to real women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star pro@@ por@@ tions ) .
they want to feel human beings to feel human body to im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , on the point if it goes around their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person@@ alities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; robots don &apos;t represent real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they can not be separated from their compan@@ ions or simply go away .
they do not have a transmission or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total sub@@ jection .
differently expressed : they are f@@ aked slaves .
or to express it in the Rede@@ mption of 2017 : maid service
tr@@ umps wide performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the in@@ ference of healthy human beings
it has become a binding of the tr@@ ump @-@ era , that the political circuits to have caused the U.S. elec@@ torate , also families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Harvest Festival , there were in the USA newspapers with advice about how to deal with hor@@ ror from Tr@@ ump to relatives .
we rig@@ orous all supp@@ os@@ edly to make our filter bub@@ bles .
less noticed the power of tr@@ umps , families together .
I mentioned this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ oriented poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , this week has visited me in New York .
they remembered me that the unit can have a strong effect against a common enemy .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows her , including the republi@@ can shift , with which she had fought for decades due to the politics , suddenly and very sharp on the same side .
in order to be the dining table , it is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in another context that this also brings substantial risks to itself .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the performing effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Tr@@ ump , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ly possibility that we will not withdraw his k@@ itt@@ ens of one day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still a fri@@ ght long @-@ time long @-@ time scenario , in the Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; normal@@ ized , &quot; which suddenly appeared in comparison to his standards as an in@@ comprehen@@ sible attack .
I think of an active nost@@ al@@ gic for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s com@@ edy version of Ver@@ back@@ wards - the dog on car &apos;s car , which did 14 % income tax ( but at least did we know how to see his tax statement ) - both occur when compared to Tr@@ ump in fact .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be spiritu@@ ally healthy to qualify for an un@@ meas@@ ur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin in the city was , we brought our children to Car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sel of the New York car department , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if there is no caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ p and the animals are turning round about their own shoul@@ ders - extreme fin@@ ster and the climate of music provides a notable way .
so many pictures of a city dis@@ appoint a city : the views of high buildings will become old , the Sky@@ lines will be familiar to offer a lot of exc@@ it@@ ement , and the reality of the city is not just a dream .
five and thirty years later , and I am not yet more about the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage , the subject @-@ pub ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a large roundabout in the north of London .
the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange experience , as here two years old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I would like to rate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no man asked after that .
on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my road it is the same , plus the option to check out with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop .
this does not only take to be a slower exchange , which should actually be a neutral exchange , but also a pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation in which no need is required .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poor woman in the department store was exc@@ it@@ ous , while I tired the experience to submit my credit card with five stars . &quot; &quot; &quot;

last year , he was brought to hospital due to the treatment of cuts to the hospital , which he suffered from the prison authorities according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to murder in prison for murder .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by taking them several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria on her .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his gir@@ l@@ friend for a n@@ igh@@ tier penetration , who hidden himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to lay against this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of whom they say that she is very dense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Criminal Law Authority said that it will be lifted up at the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal can be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;

software update for diesel vehicles : what the data affected are now to know
how exactly is the software update ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
an overview of the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software updates for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars available .
they are to improve the emission behavior of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ ted from it .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin &apos;s ACE Auto Club Europe gives insights :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the handy software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply for vehicles to do Schumann &apos;s software , &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their re@@ armament has ordered the Federal Office of the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when customers are informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced an easy implementation in the next few months , but not an exact date has been called .
Daimler has informed us to write any person concerned .
if the inspection is due upon a inspection , I &apos;ll be settled in their frames .
how long shall the equ@@ ations go out altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ anin .
the curtains of the presence of the manufacturer as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , voluntarily negoti@@ ate the car manufacturer at the subject environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the re@@ armament itself could take three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming it to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group ?
the ACE will be waiting for .
probably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is now a massive price fall from Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but just in the regions where driving dro@@ pping .
in rural areas there is no impair@@ ment losses for older diesel .
the ACE will be tra@@ itors to wait for sale .
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glorious events in Washington .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the award winners will be announced with progressive TV @-@ series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Le@@ ar announced today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to celebrate the participation in the Gala . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presidency has decided to dis@@ close the arts and human rights , even neg@@ lec@@ ted them , and prevented me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old E@@ ste@@ fan stressed that they will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump in order to clear@@ er their vision .

we make the city of life
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s City Buil@@ der , goes into R@@ ente next year .
the spot is already written - suitable applicants , however .
since 31 years W@@ acker Urban Buil@@ der is born .
and the work still makes it great fun as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
it reports varied , but also challenging tasks that wait for his successor .
at the same time , there are no application fulfilled the profile profile .
the city is looking for the next possible time a architects or construction engineer .
so - under the cont@@ emp@@ t of the regular employment period - even enough time to be el@@ aboration .
since Has@@ lach has been responsible for the administrative community as a sub@@ title authority , the candidate must submit relevant entries .
for this function wants to keep the city definitely .
if they are not able to fill out this , the citizen would have to take up to Offen@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the city was important to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker who tells of a good company as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in more than 30 years of office , some important projects are accumulated , to look back on W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is certainly over the office and its staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ o@@ zone parking space .
the chin @-@ up bridge between B@@ oll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , the st@@ adi@@ on@@ set is still subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only 1.5 million Euros to be@@ ech , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we make it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the work is fun . &quot;
design is present for a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister of large play@@ room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s its own building and gar@@ dening can be very flexi@@ bly re@@ acted on multiple .
&quot; one can move much , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the green facilities will be praised by citizens and visitors often .
since the old town stands as ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye to have it &quot; when new buildings are approved , emphas@@ ises the separ@@ ating Stadt@@ bau@@ ster .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ master carries high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is the builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything goes through my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for assistance and coordination , he can count on many long @-@ standing staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( high construction ) has been present for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( underground construction ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even that his successor is long wishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re looking for someone who really identified and would like to stay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for continu@@ ity , continu@@ ity is not only important for a good company , but also for the other design of the city .
who would like to inherit Roland W@@ acker , should have completed his studies as a diploma in graduate engineer or Bachelor of architecture , and have good technical knowledge in the areas of construction and building planning .
the municipal office and underground construction , building management , construction planning , Gr@@ under@@ growth opportunities , municipal property management with Bau@@ hof and urban gar@@ dening and sub @-@ legal authority , including monument protection .
bicycle on lines cast : rocky route blo@@ cked
according to police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had been thrown on the lines of rail crossing in the Le@@ ob@@ ener road ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so bad@@ ly damaged that the her@@ edit@@ ary freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go from two male offen@@ ders and seek after the night hours after them .
close to the facts , a ros@@ ary robot and a bike driver was observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ y , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch on the A@@ PA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the or the perpet@@ rators had brought itself in great danger and also threat@@ ens the traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the plant , as well as the late @-@ term transport and the cost of rail transport , even P@@ ön@@ alen &apos;s railway costs could also be added to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were fixed again on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the south @-@ way could be led without disabilities .
almost ten person@@ enz@@ y were unusual , two of them consider the correspondence .
freight rates did not fell , but they had del@@ ays .
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged for about 200 meters .
ins@@ ul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help , IB@@ D ( anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory case )
red meat and chocolate can be used for your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claims exactly the contrary : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based protein and dairy products , could cause symptoms of patients with inflamm@@ atory diseases .
the in@@ healing state , which affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300,000 , causes gast@@ ric acid and bub@@ bles , recur@@ ring or bloody di@@ ps , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while the suffer@@ ers normally causes meat and dairy products to avoid their symptoms , researchers found the essential amino acid tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an of proteins that promote immune cells , which promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ inal pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bs , which is in food , do not enter into the body .
cells that are capable of inflamm@@ ation , are balanced by cells , protect the tolerance and protect the body without damage without sensitive t@@ issues .
if the balance becomes too far in the direction of inflamm@@ ation , it can result a inflamm@@ atory mark .
in experiments , a kind of tolerance to the immune cell is fore@@ seen in mice , which bear a certain bacter@@ ium in its inn@@ ards .
and the bacter@@ ium needs Tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an - one of the blocks of protein - to resol@@ ve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us re@@ uter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ oma , and the development of a population of cells that promote the tolerance .
the more Tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an the mice in their food , the more they had the immune cells . &quot;
he proposed that the combination of L. re@@ uter@@ i and one of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ onic diet toler@@ ant , less anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory intest@@ ines , if the same system supports even in humans .
the post @-@ doctoral prizes in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explo@@ red a kind of immun@@ ity when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but a different group of the same tribe that was separately accommodated .
they thought that the difference with the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ omen of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ us that usually live in the stomach intest@@ inal tract .
the hel@@ mets of mice were found DNA sequ@@ encing and were found six types of bacter@@ ias , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without they were missing in mice .
mice were moved in a ster@@ ile environment , so that a intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ om was missing and they did not developed this type of immune cells , and they received the L. re@@ uter@@ i and immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria rose to the immune system , the researchers ends L. re@@ uter@@ i in a liquid and carried out small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells that were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
as the active component of the liquid was cleaned , it proved to be a minor product of the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an Met@@ abol@@ ism , known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 @-@ acid @-@ acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an@@ values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ able cells such as mice , and that most of us L. re@@ uter@@ i protect our stomach @-@ intest@@ ines .
it is not known if tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an @-@ side products from L. re@@ uter@@ i to develop cells in people such as with mice , but defects in relation to tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an were found in people with inflamm@@ atory formulation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of this cells is probably something that we want to promote , since these cells control inflamm@@ ation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially , high tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an@@ values in the presence of L. re@@ uter@@ i can lead to expanding this population . &quot;

new dr@@ au@@ ght for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind revol@@ ves : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was more Chief of the SPD , the S &amp; D Prime Minister had always always met with a certain concern about Berlin .
just no distur@@ b@@ ance from the party centre , just no counter@@ winds from the federal state - as the most important desire of the election fighting .
since Martin Schulz , the party has changed itself .
since then , employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus took over the events in the SPD @-@ reg@@ ained state capit@@ als .
what is Schulz from there since the beginning of the year , would not have been described again in the approach .
there were deep advice .
and one after another .
the CD @-@ CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green is simply not reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber &apos;s editor for Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising leader of a green @-@ dep@@ uties , the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) was over@@ thrown into a serious crisis .
five months before the Parliament election lost its red @-@ green coalition with its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Party Director Michael Kell@@ ner has asked the ab@@ dic@@ ure @-@ Sax@@ on green @-@ Sax@@ on green @-@ dep@@ uties El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to return to their mandate .
the over@@ lap of the CD@@ U means a clear de@@ formation of voters .
El@@ ke T@@ ry must immediately return to your mandate , &quot; said the Federal President and Election Network of the Green Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not all that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sigh@@ ed , a SPD @-@ election campaign , as at the Friday morning , the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message has reached the party centre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands in accordance with the transition of the green dep@@ uties El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CD@@ U without own government majority .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small cr@@ ises in SPD @-@ Landes@@ feder@@ ations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ sions started with the un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , no more , s@@ oo@@ ked up the com@@ ra@@ des of the time .
according to the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
this was then too - and it was clearly worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the deaf people , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite hau@@ te the party in smooth .
in the weeks , the com@@ ra@@ des def@@ ended after the weeks returned .
then , when they had just turned into a new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next deep .
Mayor O@@ laf Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD Land@@ ef , lost its Nim@@ bus in that weekend , because he was in the elite harmon@@ ie while his town burned .
and because he did so wrong in the crisis communication so rather all that you can do wrong .
since then Schol@@ z f@@ ights his political survival .
so Stephan Weil .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust gas and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister had already been in criticism since a long time .
Mi@@ ese change values came to .
nevertheless , or perhaps , because , in the past few weeks , Because , in the past few weeks , I tried to acc@@ entu@@ ate acc@@ ents .
the aspir@@ ation of the former mayor of Hanover , expanding its power in Berlin , remained not hidden in the field of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , as they spoke of because a stabil@@ ization of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
thereby , because , because of the part@@ isan hospital , the Lower Sax@@ on Green is not guilty on the part@@ isan .
and Schulz don &apos;t believe .
sometimes the com@@ ra@@ des are ra@@ des , that &apos;s your own rows are closed .
her wrath lies on the Green Party , and here especially on the back@@ sliding par@@ li@@ ament@@ arian in T@@ jack@@ ets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democracy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the interests of all others &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , Chief of the Par@@ part of the SPD Bundestag &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the editor Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. T@@ ry has not been elected as Director of Lower Saxony &apos;s Green Party because of their person as a direct di@@ dat@@ or in parliament .
the logical consequence would be that she returns to its mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD parliament , compl@@ ained a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ eu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters made four years ago , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people have made Stephan Weil to the prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who led the Lower Saxony &apos;s Socialist candidate to the Bundestag election , R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , the personal kar@@ ri@@ ed@@ ling of a future CD@@ U member states the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know whether there is more or more out@@ ages of the CD@@ U Niedersachsen .
funding for the centre of town III
who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years , will be able to get the following support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of Ste@@ g Urban Development were received on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler had a look back to the so far .
since 1991 it has been active in the renovation areas .
at that time , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the State of Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ t@@ emberg have taken two thirds of the funding amount .
in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the allowance was still 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous sanctions are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote internal development , and not only new construction areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , we have received the information from the Presidential Committee of Karlsruhe that will give it a rehabilitation area .
the total amount may be 8@@ 33 333 euro , of which should be 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the church .
how is a renovation area now ?
you will continue to examine so Sch@@ in@@ dler further , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
however , it also plays a role whether in the planned area of all interest is to be rehabil@@ it@@ ated .
if necessary , the area should also shift again .
the jet@@ ty came on Wednesday night , Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cellar presented the contents of the &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program in which frames would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
core of the program are the Rev@@ it@@ alisation of Interior cities , improving the residential and working conditions and ob@@ taining and extension of infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is called per plot .
the renovation area would then be defined as a statute .
the grant period for funding is scheduled for the funding period from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2017 .
however , until September of this year , however , only once the inventory may be carried out , within the context of those involved parties involved a questionn@@ aire would be carried out .
as of November or December , the pro@@ positi@@ onal movement should be carried out , so that in the coming year will be started with the sanctions .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then declared that every Commun@@ e will conduct the bes@@ po@@ em preliminary investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s therefore to evaluate the urban mis@@ circumstances and decide when san@@ ction is and in which circum@@ ference . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the property will then be entered for the respective plot as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann would come again after , and make itself a picture of the location , promised them .
Got@@ zel stressed , a major success factor for the project was the participation of the involved .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires that can be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; building and bound@@ ary , &quot; among others , among others for the construction condition and the renovation views .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionn@@ aire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data may be made to size , distribution and inhabitants of a living room . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only complete if the premises are operated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is considered to be observed , the Got@@ zel showed that a full @-@ filled questionn@@ aire is not simultaneously based on the funding .
in addition , new construction work will not be eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler emphas@@ ized that the distribution of the conveyor is functional according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wind@@ screen principle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - who first comes first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you could not reserve any funding for later &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Centre II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was shown to make the restoration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the cost of the White House costs tax@@ pay@@ ers expenses
the decision of the White House , a Marine helicopter to fly the South La@@ wn in the last month , tax@@ pay@@ ers will cost tax@@ pay@@ ers after the end of the military to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , the heart of the event was held on July 17th in the White House with American building programmes .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a round of products from all 50 states .
the helicopter designed by a yacht out of Ma@@ ine , a fire brig@@ ade from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft from Mississippi , was issued in Connecticut .
the military service of the White House demanded the presence of helicop@@ ters in an frag@@ ment@@ ary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the Hel@@ icop@@ ter Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit , responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted only that you are aware of that , because there is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commander of H@@ MX @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the event on his superior , the deputy marin@@ ade for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long remained until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 in this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the white house should be delayed , due to the limitation of service hours a second team would be needed for the return flight .
the original air@@ crew was located during the helicopter during the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time .
out of the TI@@ ME available , it was not clear that ultimately , a second flight crew was necessary .
the H@@ atch Act prohib@@ its federal state to use state ownership for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 is asked if the event could viol@@ ate the appointment .
&quot; a question that we exhibited if it was about a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; sounds if you are closed , &quot; he answered the Deputy Command@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as official event and would not be covered by H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the official events have political ones .
on the event , the President gave a violation of the reform of health reform , which was in the Senate , and he prophesied the efforts to rule the government regulations .
the use of the airplane that is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon .
pre@@ sidents are obliged to use it for travel .
but their use only for a photo OP , is unusual .
Tr@@ ump was carried out in February an investigation into the Presidential aircraft before the background of his first campaigns in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ Services , and his Twitter account is full of announ@@ cements through the use of the Presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is fascin@@ ated by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the representative office of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn by the US President in the White House with precise cuts .
when Tr@@ ump started in Germany at the beginning of July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led 58 exercises in the White House 58 exercises .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was counted at the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , said the officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flo@@ ps in addition 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support commis@@ sions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden of any other re@@ pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of Sik@@ or@@ sky said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company had not been involved to set the helicopter on the South La@@ wn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 has no budgets for the presidential trips , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ d of the US Defence Ministry for the Financial Year 2017 the Do@@ D Group for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is however 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
records of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ anti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for the operation of helicop@@ ters are far below that rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers are based on the basis of estimates for the refund of funds , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance , and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from the year 2015 , the funds for Do@@ D does not include personnel costs , but consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at that time the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of helicop@@ ters for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea to present this week things , which will be produced in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they can contribute to our national security , and I go out that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent .
and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicop@@ ters and other military equipment , so many Americans have un@@ ti@@ relessly worked .
of course , it is appropriate to create . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of South La@@ wn by the La@@ wn of La@@ wn , but he sat down in the driver seat of a fire brig@@ ade .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and cher@@ ished the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
just back to the rear positions , I find the team very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV , especially the imports from the high north .

&quot; it will always be hard for us .
there you need good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team is practical for the trip to the high north .

how America the OMV can harm
really happy Donald Tr@@ ump did not work when he continued to sign his signature under the law of sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his d@@ ost , the Law issued a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he considers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the response from Moscow was so sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ aming against the US army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the design is to be pen@@ alised , European companies can help the Rus@@ sians , gas @-@ cast gas into the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in accordance with other European companies , investors have been financed to the construction of Russian Ost@@ se@@ el@@ eit@@ ing Nord Stream 2 together with other European firms .
the dro@@ pping is enormous .
nevertheless it is too early for an assessment of consequences , so the official statement of the oil concert .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump must even raise the sanctions against life by the Executive Order .
twelve weapons will stand for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press has been viewed which the Group could be we@@ aving , and which could really do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;

roll back@@ wards : the town represents 46 kitchen aid
the town organizes the K@@ ita lunch itself again .
with fixed response partners for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the urban kinder@@ garten the clock is turned back .
towards the 1st of September , the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the Ess@@ ential supply in the urban children &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ ance , deputy head in the department of youth help , this is a good news : &quot; we all have very pleased . &quot;
cooked , except house : a C@@ ater@@ ina takes over this task and delivers fresh cooked cooled .
the city operates in the area of 46 kinder@@ gart@@ ens , in 44 the children of lun@@ ch@@ time get a warm meal .
in the last summer year , 2800 children were sitting at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; meanwhile , there are not only children who are cared for 45 lessons , in the K@@ ita , explains Pom@@ er@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision if children will stay up to 14 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 participants from the 1st of September of the kitchen service : they are warm up to the meals , supplement the food , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , rinse the meal , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the staff are assigned to a K@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two group@@ ed as well as sevent@@ een troops - decides about the hour circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now satisfied with the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much stronger , and it is easier to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because it is also : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children shall help the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen @-@ power team is to be useful .
also for kids .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known power in K@@ ita , a person who tru@@ sts in them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important to children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far the task of the kitchen forces - will be settled in future cleaning staff .
this variant - the separation of cleans@@ ing and kitchen service - has also the charm of the kitchen performance even the charm , which she asked for the city as the most economic activity , is from the press office .
and that even though 46 sub@@ time forces are newly set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the educ@@ ating area &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ ance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

generations of families have been working here and the labour force strongly focus on local community and the Greater Glasgow , a major pillar for de@@ cent employment in a field of high unemployment and social dis@@ agreements .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , pay@@ roll and pro@@ sper@@ ity , and before the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the increasing life administration costs and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow ur@@ gently need a flor@@ ic@@ ating production line at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesperson from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross only has received a letter of G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will react directly to them , since we estimate continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had a regular meetings with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed .
we discussed the employees that we are like all the companies that are active in an extremely competitive and un@@ safe business climate , our stores are constantly increasing - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds , particularly in production lines and operating improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility . we should change our business processes at the location , the staff and their union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned about three years ago before N@@ ey@@ mar ?

Paris Saint @-@ Germain is not leaving in their persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar after they have issued an offer of £ 189 million to resol@@ ve his free@@ ass@@ ment clause , but they warned Barcelona before three years ago ?
the sensational approach has the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United .
after the termination , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athletes of the world . PS@@ G provides wages of more than 500.000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is mad about the way , such as N@@ ey@@ mar has en@@ forced its way to outside the catalogue , although a source in the vicinity of the Catal@@ ans established that the club has always been given to care for him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .
but the football world was warned about three years ago from the PS@@ G pre@@ sidents before this view ?
in Manchester City 2014 , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign one of the best player from PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not careful because they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they are trying to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded these line , whereby the Spanish association will express interest in the PS@@ G center player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G clearly did that it would not allow it to travel to the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by taking one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report from Pope @-@ Bro@@ ther Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ions of the Reg@@ ions of Dom@@ atzen Report on the Miss@@ is &quot; Pope @-@ Bro@@ ther Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and histor@@ ian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report to the confusion sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues to discussions .
Christian Weis@@ nder , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after the publication of the German press agency , he acquired by the former Reg@@ ions Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of emer@@ itus Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an exc@@ use .
it would be very pleased to meet the appearance of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep@@ ening beyond their own under@@ lines or their wrong ass@@ essing the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Vatican Law &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was critic@@ ised that with the coverage of violence in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two different measure &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in regard to the survivors in Regensburg , no one knows that it would be pen@@ alised and com@@ bing deeds &quot; handle that should be pen@@ alised and in the future , but the author Lu@@ c@@ etta S@@ car@@ aff@@ ia , histor@@ ian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hab@@ it , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil experience , is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes S@@ car@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Princip@@ ality of Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in the interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is going to be on the church and this is a shorter fres@@ co@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Moreover , they pointed out that in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been a normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be a normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to be ready for children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they beg@@ inner , today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , because the world have changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in connection with the reports about the mis@@ use cases often the Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger could often be visited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , author and histor@@ ian Michael Hes@@ emann , who is translated with R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says E@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the reporting period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which was presented by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ iti@@ ves were captured between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; High Pl@@ au@@ sibility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of survivors , 67 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of sexual abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report , it is also known to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg until 1994 : &quot; summar@@ izing that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were applied .
even at high eman@@ cip@@ ality , the punishment for the pupils could also be intense .
however , contrary to numerous other documents , that many victims were estimated that many victims were estim@@ oni@@ ously estimated and therefore , in numerous cases , even positive memories will be combined with him . &quot;
the interview explains H@@ emann , why the final report on the abuse of the Reg@@ ions of the Reg@@ ions Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the inci@@ dents of violence of violence against gu@@ ardian &quot; in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dome &quot; depic@@ ts a contra@@ dic@@ tory image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a lift , many students take up his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the other , he also appears as chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who , when an Dom@@ sp@@ atz was produced no top performance .
how do you evaluate this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the rear , the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger should be found in it .
therefore , eight pages dedicated , and he will be acquitted of all suspic@@ ion of medi@@ ation or co @-@ workers with the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
even the con@@ tex@@ tual exhibitions at the pre@@ school took place outside of his work sphere .
you may be able to leave it too late , of which too late or first encoun@@ ters have not been serious enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ estic High School &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he worked out of practically all respon@@ dents than - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the wide majority of his student Georg R@@ atz@@ inger combines him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warm &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who provided the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
merely a minority worth about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emot@@ ion , which led to W@@ ut@@ out@@ breaks even more times .
that he did not only cast with chairs and the key con@@ federation on the floor , but also j@@ ump@@ ed guys to the hair or ears , he has already deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and exc@@ it@@ ated himself .
however , it has to be said to be hon@@ our@@ able , that such educ@@ ating methods in the late period , the 1960s and 1970s , were widespread , with parents such as teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I have experienced the still in a world @-@ wide school , a state gymn@@ asium .
compared to this report , in fact , in this report , the indispensable sexual abuse and the awareness of the school , the fre@@ il@@ i b@@ agu@@ ette are b@@ agu@@ ed .
since it is asking if it is not rather with his friend and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI to do that many media fell on him .
on the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood him still , still ei@@ fri@@ g .
but the truth is : the report from Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s report in every respect !
the media was reported in the context of the report very much about the subject of abuse during the Reg@@ ens@@ burger cathedral .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report even some processing or cont@@ acting with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clear no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual belie@@ fs claims to have committed himself to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never clo@@ cked me to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the person representing the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was very embar@@ rass@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real problem in the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of sexual abuse was , and it is that most victims of swal@@ lows are silent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they did not take parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then quite a ch@@ oral manager , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ ine pupils take a role with regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ ably student @-@ formulated this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... see ... no case , in which he would have had happened ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have kept the respective perpet@@ rators .
I think it ... also for really ab@@ sur@@ d , take it to him ... bub@@ bles on ur@@ gent or clear@@ er or rather , as compared to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ leit@@ ern , confidence teacher etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - und@@ ou@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the whole clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the ap@@ ron affected students and / or their environment could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free of charge of sexual abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he cannot be accused of being prevented or brought him to display . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore there is no reason to bring his good name to these contra@@ dic@@ tive crimes committed as it was unfortunately in some cases .
in the media there was much of &quot; Gew@@ al@@ tex@@ z@@ essen &quot; to read in the Reg@@ ions of Dom@@ est@@ rian .
in the report , the former domain name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is set out in the report .
do he have to live with this alleg@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the great problem that in reporting everything is mixed and po@@ unded to a huge mil@@ let of sexual abuse and waters somewhere , in the middle of dr@@ in , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but just this is a mis@@ use of the reporting .
there is ne@@ sted separately : between the school and the gramm@@ ar school of the cathedral @-@ atzen , between sexual abuse and waters , we say once again to rest .
Moreover , the report deals from the time since 1945 , i.e. from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral conductors of the cathedral @-@ atzen .
the whole aw@@ ful test education , the cases , in which child of sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers have suffered and mal@@ ign@@ ited , they took part in the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ zh@@ ausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where truly sc@@ andal@@ ous states must have ruled .
but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only on his face , when they were already at the Dom@@ estic High School .
on the same way , like most of the Wit@@ nesses , the topic &quot; Vor@@ schule &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
one was just happy to escape , and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ a@@ this &quot; states .
what was different at the Dom@@ estic High School ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was an discipline as early as discipline , but no sa@@ dist@@ ic violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , at which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims were estimated that &quot; many victims were estimated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite violence even positive memories &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the most , the alleg@@ ation still remains .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two time periods in which it was reported to him by the states .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish and started out of their predec@@ essors at a school where he did not work and responsible , ( as the witness ) would not hear , and then again around 1993 .
closed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral @-@ eng@@ ymn@@ asium , which was even reproduced in the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has shown this way to be pract@@ ised in the pre @-@ school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in view of the danger of negative press release , it is ur@@ gent .
this was naturally forbidden to a time when legal clarity had been banned in Bavaria .
before that , they took place in a legal gray zone , like everyone knows us .
it was too difficult for him , where the suffer@@ ers perhaps over@@ threw or dramatic , and where really the permitted limit was exceeded .
but you can not say , he would always have gone away .
that is not true .
the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria in 1980 .
princip@@ ality in Gloria von Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is , yes , it is un@@ fair to use today &apos;s educational standards at the time of time .
how do you see this ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we speak histor@@ ian since the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger to evaluate today &apos;s moral standards .
here the princ@@ ess has already right .
but this does not apply to sexual abuse , who was ab@@ hor@@ red in all times , and not for that which was broken up in the school of resistance and violence against exc@@ itation of children , that goes far beyond that time .
this is all horri@@ ble and I &apos;m glad that it is finally processed .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
its funds to the discipl@@ ines and punishment , thus ear@@ nest and ears to go , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was forbidden then he has also kept stri@@ pped it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is the picture of his ra@@ iny day Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
came the subject of inspec@@ tions on the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book , however , is about life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , as the Dom@@ sp@@ ikes played only one side roll .
nevertheless , I don &apos;t have a way that he led there a thor@@ ough reg@@ iment there .
however , this must be said once again : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without any un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably hardly possible to form the true cultural heritage of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one makes no great singer , and before each success , at which area , still discipline , passion and self @-@ overcome .
as what a man did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger when convers@@ ations on her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : I learned about the work on the book and beyond that I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger and always experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , deep faith and warm people , from which one could not imagine that he could only do something like a fly .
I arrive regularly with , like many former domains today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly contact him , visit him , he is almost blind - and as a member of their family .
those who didn &apos;t forgive him up to now that he was even strictly to them , so are clearly in minority .
most Dom@@ sp@@ ouses are than@@ k@@ ful to him that he has enriched their lives and has brought to them the world of music .
and that he always had a good , v@@ ä@@ del@@ ight@@ ful teacher - a str@@ ingent father , sure that may be a very quiet respect , to whom they still watch and honour them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; and please , once again , all that one should be submitted to him are the educ@@ ators that were on the agenda at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can be glad that we have over@@ overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because it is very promin@@ ently and has a more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al fall into sin .
there is the wicked intention , that is behind it , only too obvious .
for the report that was just released , over@@ load it .
now the inc@@ eption would remain , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bay@@ erns , and perhaps in Germany no one would know the reg@@ iment of the Reg@@ ions , finally in peace .
