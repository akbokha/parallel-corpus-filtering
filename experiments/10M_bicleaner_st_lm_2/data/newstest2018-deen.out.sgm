<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people are to meet with young people.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pftkapelle, where it is dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners to generate the lonely reason of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Münch supports exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">There are nervous when maps are not currently underway.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone knows everyone who had to excitated because the car Navi had to display a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical map maps of the digital Bayern atlases, an offer of geoport as the Bavaria of the state government, are all other than currently - but just very easy-to-end.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then, the cities and municipalities in the spread-area of Munich Mercury has changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a flip-epping, whom you don't know as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">Into the large map map for cities and municipalities with more detailed maps, so-called urine sheets, were incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were produced according to the Bavarian publisher of Bayerns between 1810 and 1864 and skip the first survey of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader in Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second coalition war with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops entered the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801: there were today's neighbours that created the idea of a country-wide Bavaria-card.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürh Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian failure.</seg>
<seg id="19">The prehistoric sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is how to find out all others on the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the case of the state capital on the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The town has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is Untersendling, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Shipling was born 21 years after the map, in 1877 as a Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Houses are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the Western park is, you can see nothing as a fields - at first glance: when in-zooming appears a small-part map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten entries from the so-called "Urabsorption," which was derived from the fundamental tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots" "" "are no farmers there today - but small gardeners of the plant" "" "Land in Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, in the 19th century, was still a meadow, and there was no concrete desert in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map shows an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the urine sheet we read in the area of today's au Haidhausen area" "" "or" "" "on the guest" "" "or from the height" "" "on the sky" "" "but also in big letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the AuerField Road, one had once used people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">There was in 1858 / 59 the Munich circle-Irrenanstalt "On the Auer Lüge."</seg>
<seg id="34">In 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden managed to set up the establishment of a psychiatrist who is associated with King Ludwigs II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time and ended for example the tapes of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has taught the staff to apply violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="37">It was first place for 280 patients and later was extended to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime, this capacity is not enough - the reason for the construction of the circulated plant in hair in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of the largest psychiatric area of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">At the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people gathered in Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order bought the building complex in 1920 and turned him to a youth center with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">Situated to the west, the soccer field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's House" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built in the architectorate of origin of the origin of the Irrenal, which was destroyed during the Second World War." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz" "" "was recorded as a" "" "main square" "", "the merchants" "" "Kaufinger street" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Münch.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies broke out many holes to the downtown in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - on the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a Gruftkapelle from the Middle Ages, where these days are working on the Marienhof, where these days are scheduled and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony will take place for the second S-Bahn line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich map can be easily compare with the aerial picture of today - and the hole on the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights publishes travelers for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for Promotion of Farms has issued a warning for colored people who travel to the state-discrimination and racial attacks from the state to Missouri.</seg>

<seg id="53">A recently built-in law of Missouri, which makes it difficult to win discrimination against discrimination, as well as the criminal prosecution authorities, the group led out the travel documents, the NAACP said.</seg>

<seg id="57">"" "" "" "it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA." ""</seg>
<seg id="58">The group spent incidents like rumbernation against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in fragile conditions at the beginning of the year, after he had no petrol more petrol, and from the police in custody, was accused of accused of accused of crimes.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also indicates a recent report by the Office of the General Prosecutor of Missouri, in which it will be shown that black drivers are more common than whiters in the state 75 percent.</seg>

<seg id="64">The travel agent is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it difficult to accuse a company due to residential or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberal Union (ACLU) travel dates for Texas and Arizona, after the States decided to commit local prosecution authorities to deceive people because of immigration fraud, which will contribute to the survey of ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel documents are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but in recent days, stakeholders have contracted the measure as response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weizaunting project is Elemental</seg>
<seg id="68">The fisherman Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestagsmen Peter White and Kordula Kovac have a picture given itself on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the recovenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU county joined together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann also granted insights into its operations in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young people and houses in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "" "" "Schwarzwaldmilk" "" "is the alternative way for him of the world's alternative solution for the milk of its cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the guests there is a Regional Office.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also the BLHV-Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the "Elemental Project as" Elemental Project. "</seg>
<seg id="75">I can do not generate on derart steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green pastoral care for much work, much shots with the brushcutter are machined.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have here with the terms and conditions of the topography," "" "said Schwendemann" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider," "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the Weizaunts and is delighted about leader promotion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, the farmers will have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">"" "" "" "we hope that the power of the land could still be cast out for a while." ""</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure that we have, are the people who work in agriculture, and imagine thoughts, as they continue their operation," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, about 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure area is thus 40 hectares, which will not be forged until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">It was funded by the total cost of 71 500 Euros, half of the leader was funded by the municipality of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers stayed 12 610 euros which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometers of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do not make a really good job, without farmers and farmers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter White," "" "the best food is produced here" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Federal Constitutional Court (LPR) Baden-Wuerttemberg enables the state support of wheat fence.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">A prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR recorded funding.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the enclosed area should not be bad damage (hangar over 35 per cent) and must thus be threatened by issuance.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the 2018 ifiaunting project 2018, the application currently runs from eight participants with 24 pitches, which would like to build almost 16 kilometers of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, with a total cost of more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes off the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest signs of a regime change is to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate the same as any other - therefore the carefully taking Saddam Hussein's place on the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he did a symbolic battle with Jim Acosta by CNN's proposals for drastic restriction of legitimate immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boilers and Liberty Imitators would have it gelyncht when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took their significance, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to the famous poem of Emma Lazarus, 17 years after the completion of the mind, its base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta complained: "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom, which enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to which later was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively true, but how he formulated it itself, is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It goes around the contemporary resonance of Lazarus, the only thing in which a state is not just any old immigrants, but the poor of the poor: "your poor, your poor, and your afflicted masses, which is to breathe free, / the afflicted waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there never had a time in which the" "" "elongation" "" "was better to see on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller committed themselves not in literary criticism - it clearly did that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate: it is in fact a conflict around the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after her death on the basis - did they knew a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicism by combining the female subjects of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in its poem is the female figure no more abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is one another name: mother of Exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the painting with the picture is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just like Lazarus the significance of the statue, the people wanted to change the people from right wing as long as long.</seg>
<seg id="118">The big Schreihas Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was conserviced, but rather an early neo-conservatives, which will bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty continues.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom of the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not shine in the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh click here to something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite a question of the perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "the great imaginative perceiving of Lazarus was to see how they saw from the exhausted, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "" "" "it's true senses to see the world from perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">"" "their statue says to them the words of hope and of the will they hear." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="126">And that's not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to detect.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not shine on the way, but the hatred, which is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of the interior policy until his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He implied with criticism, safe.</seg>

<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions from at least 450 people and cleared their opinion on its official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil liberties Union accused him of this week.</seg>

<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is no reactionary pinion.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a strong hand on the leadership of his state and strict observance of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary funds to connect to his voters and play his hairless head towards chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Hence, the blockage of people who are on the side of the governors - which is a public forum, which is officially designated as officially, and of employees that are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and finally dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defended Hogan's spokesperson for Amelia Chasse, argued the actions of the governors and argued that the blockage of the comments may not be more than a moderation.</seg>

<seg id="2095">The gallery is planned: the gallery is planned exactly on the property, in which 13 direct products will offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">The construction work will be at the beginning of the construction work.</seg>

<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost infinite - that hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupiter and Haarlem, which were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analytics had a 35-year prison sentence, after they publicly made diplomatic information on the site of WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition that was opened on August 2, means A Becoming Resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was transformed into technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transaction and groundbreaking dissidents whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been extracted from the algorithms that was extracted from Manning, and that some intellectuals could not only be interpreted using these genomic data - the many ways, how they can interpret and the infirmities determinants of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but since their puberty, was openly spoken through the identification than woman, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the spionage law, computer and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison their image was suppressed, so much that it was only one photo - a grain-white, black-white selfie, in which Manning sits uncomfortable on a driver seat and a platine blonde is associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg returned from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it, the artist's portrait of strangers originates from forenic artefacts such as cigarette smoke and chewing gum, extracted from the waste in order to produce a picture of how people could look like.</seg>

<seg id="2137">And they could not visit this time and could not be photographed, therefore, they took contact with Chelsea and asked whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">In the course of two years, the artist and its imprisoned Muse were interviewed by several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even illustrate one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic "Supported Images," which was foreseen a future in which the President Chelate Judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In fact, Obama was actually only few days after the book was published, Manning release after seven brutal years in Kansas, he was a welcome type of lucky meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and starred, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against Transfrontier troops to find new, tweaked ways to find the rigid circuits, which he should actually fix it to flames.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg, following the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen to a given reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one of the gallery, the artistic statement called for Manning with its superior signature (the "i" in their family name is equipped with a heart) an end of "automatic collapse, the foundation of gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence is an exchange of Cs and Gs and As, in pencil.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can be used for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the contrary: a diet that is rich in meat-based protein and dairy products, could cause symptoms of patients with inflammatory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The inhealing state, which affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300,000, causes gastric acid and bubbles, recurring or bloody dips, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the sufferers normally causes meat and dairy products to avoid their symptoms, researchers found the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins that promote immune cells, which promote a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestinal patrol to ensure that harmful microbs, which is in food, do not enter into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of inflammation, are balanced by cells, protect the tolerance and protect the body without damage without sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance becomes too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result a inflammatory mark.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, a kind of tolerance to the immune cell is foreseen in mice, which bear a certain bacterium in its innards.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the blocks of protein - to resolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbioma, and the development of a population of cells that promote the tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more Tryptophan the mice in their food, the more they had the immune cells. "</seg>

<seg id="2593">They thought that the difference with the intestinal microbiomen of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungus that usually live in the stomach intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The helmets of mice were found DNA sequencing and were found six types of bacterias, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without they were missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were moved in a sterile environment, so that a intestinal microbiom was missing and they did not developed this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria rose to the immune system, the researchers ends L. reuteri in a liquid and carried out small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active component of the liquid was cleaned, it proved to be a minor product of the tryptophan Metabolism, known as Indol-3-acid-acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophanvalues were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerable cells such as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect our stomach-intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known if tryptophan-side products from L. reuteri to develop cells in people such as with mice, but defects in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regensitives were captured between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s," "" "High Plausibility" "" "victims of survivors, 67" "" "victims of sexual abuse." ""</seg>

<seg id="2906">Even at high emancipality, the punishment for the pupils could also be intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">However, contrary to numerous other documents, that many victims were estimated that many victims were estimoniously estimated and therefore, in numerous cases, even positive memories will be combined with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">The interview explains Hemann, why the final report on the abuse of the Regions of the Regions Georg Ratzinger in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the incidents of violence of violence against guardian "in the Regensburger Dome" depicts a contradictory image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for a lift, many students take up his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">For the other, he also appears as choleriker and perfectionist, who, when an Domspatz was produced no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the rear, the name Georg Ratzinger should be found in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Therefore, eight pages dedicated, and he will be acquitted of all suspicion of mediation or co-workers with the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Even the contextual exhibitions at the preschool took place outside of his work sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You may be able to leave it too late, of which too late or first encounters have not been serious enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the Domestic High School" "", "which he worked out of practically all respondents than -" "" "salvation" "", "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "thus, the wide majority of his student Georg Ratzinger combines him as" "" "warm" "", "" "" "competent" "", "" "" "competent" "", "" "" "competent" "", "who provided the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and bonbons" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Merely a minority worth about his perfectionism and its high emotion, which led to Wutoutbreaks even more times.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only cast with chairs and the key confederation on the floor, but also jumped guys to the hair or ears, he has already deeply regretted and excitated himself.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, it has to be said to be honourable, that such educating methods in the late period, the 1960s and 1970s, were widespread, with parents such as teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have experienced the still in a world-wide school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to this report, in fact, in this report, the indispensable sexual abuse and the awareness of the school, the freili baguette are bagued.</seg>
<seg id="2926">Since it is asking if it is not rather with his friend and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI to do that many media fell on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him still, still eifrig.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report from Georg Ratzinger's report in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">The media was reported in the context of the report very much about the subject of abuse during the Regensburger cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report even some processing or contacting with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clear no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual beliefs claims to have committed himself to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never clocked me to speak with my father or my mother," "" "said one of the person representing the others," "" "It was very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">"" "" "" "the real problem in the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was, and it is that most victims of swallows are silent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not take parents and siblings, then quite a choral manager, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspine pupils take a role with regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionably student-formulated this way: "regarding sexual abuse... see... no case, in which he would have had happened (Georg Ratzinger) and could have kept the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd, take it to him... bubbles on urgent or clearer or rather, as compared to their parents, internatsleitern, confidence teacher etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - undoubar. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the whole clear result:" "" "that in the apron affected students and / or their environment could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">In fact, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free of charge of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2943">"" "" "" "so he cannot be accused of being prevented or brought him to display." ""</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to bring his good name to these contradictive crimes committed as it was unfortunately in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media there was much of "Gewaltexzessen" to read in the Regions of Domestrian.</seg>
<seg id="2946">In the report, the former domain name Georg Ratzinger is set out in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this allegation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the great problem that in reporting everything is mixed and pounded to a huge millet of sexual abuse and waters somewhere, in the middle of drin, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But just this is a misuse of the reporting.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is nested separately: between the school and the grammar school of the cathedral-atzen, between sexual abuse and waters, we say once again to rest.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Moreover, the report deals from the time since 1945, i.e. from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral conductors of the cathedral-atzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful test education, the cases, in which child of sadistic teachers have suffered and malignited, they took part in the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous states must have ruled.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only on his face, when they were already at the Domestic High School.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On the same way, like most of the Witnesses, the topic "Vorschule" tabu. "</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was just happy to escape, and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "parathis" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domestic High School?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was an discipline as early as discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, at which the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims were estimated that" many victims were estimated that "" "" despite violence even positive memories "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="2959">At the most, the allegation still remains.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two time periods in which it was reported to him by the states.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish and started out of their predecessors at a school where he did not work and responsible, (as the witness) would not hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Closed Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral-engymnasium, which was even reproduced in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "" "" "it has shown this way to be practised in the pre-school." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the danger of negative press release, it is urgent.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was naturally forbidden to a time when legal clarity had been banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took place in a legal gray zone, like everyone knows us.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was too difficult for him, where the sufferers perhaps overthrew or dramatic, and where really the permitted limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can not say, he would always have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria in 1980.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Principality in Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, yes, it is unfair to use today's educational standards at the time of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we speak historian since the "Fallstrick of Anachronism," thus the danger to evaluate today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Here the princess has already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this does not apply to sexual abuse, who was abhorred in all times, and not for that which was broken up in the school of resistance and violence against excitation of children, that goes far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all horrible and I'm glad that it is finally processed.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Its funds to the disciplines and punishment, thus earnest and ears to go, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was forbidden then he has also kept stripped it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what is the picture of his rainy day Georg Ratzinger because talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the subject of inspections on the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book, however, is about life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, as the Domspikes played only one side roll.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I don't have a way that he led there a thorough regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">However, this must be said once again: without these perfectionism, without any unconditional discipline, it would probably hardly possible to form the true cultural heritage of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bonbons alone, one makes no great singer, and before each success, at which area, still discipline, passion and self-overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2987">As what a man did you experience Georg Ratzinger when conversations on her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: I learned about the work on the book and beyond that I experienced Georg Ratzinger and always experienced as wonderful, humorous, deep faith and warm people, from which one could not imagine that he could only do something like a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I arrive regularly with, like many former domains today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly contact him, visit him, he is almost blind - and as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who didn't forgive him up to now that he was even strictly to them, so are clearly in minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspouses are thankful to him that he has enriched their lives and has brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always had a good, vädelightful teacher - a stringent father, sure that may be a very quiet respect, to whom they still watch and honour them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">"" "and" "" and please, once again, all that one should be submitted to him are the educators that were on the agenda at that time. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overovercome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because it is very prominently and has a more prominent brother to make the medial fall into sin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the wicked intention, that is behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that was just released, overload it.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the inception would remain, a 93-year-old man who had acquired great merits and without the outside of Bayerns, and perhaps in Germany no one would know the regiment of the Regions, finally in peace.</seg>
