Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on : I am always plug@@ ged in drawers .
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on must not always be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ am@@ big@@ uous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll always be plug@@ ged in drawers or on the inside of the label which have mostly little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to be perfect and successfully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; hon@@ est@@ ly said these things rather be@@ es@@ cal@@ ator . &quot;
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as they explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; to white &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring them the question after the children &apos;s wish : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to be married or children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;

gol@@ fer Lang@@ er receives the dr@@ ons
his experiences on the horse are over@@ looked .
by the end of a golf course in South Africa Bernhard Lang@@ er , with some colleague a little di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ olds .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lang@@ er
after a few minutes , the horses remembered their closing , they pursued in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p after the feed .
a kilometre at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lang@@ er .
and thus the riding career ended again .
on Saturday the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament victories - again in the vicinity of horses .
he left himself with his family over the complex of the AL@@ RV , on a horse @-@ sw@@ ang he doesn &apos;t go to photo bil@@ isi .
it was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Sports Hel@@ ping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was presented to the man from An@@ hausen in the framework of a little Gala of the Golden W@@ pyramid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no awards for the sympath@@ etic athl@@ ete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , silver , bay leaf , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already hated him .
long is the 18th lau@@ re@@ ates of the pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first award winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this distinction is very much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lang@@ er , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only for spor@@ tive successes , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lang@@ er has been supporting the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ fold U.S. Masters winner was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot;
for the excep@@ tions , athletes of Hart@@ wig G@@ ien@@ ger , the Turner Eber@@ hard G@@ ien@@ ger , the F@@ ender Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ ek@@ e , the spr@@ int of Al@@ win Sho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously of the hand@@ held of all Erhard .
many of these sporting events came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the lively company moved to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza Prize ran .
Bernhard Lang@@ er kept the distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and tr@@ umps economic policy comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
in infrastructure invest in infrastructure and prevent trade agreements T@@ TP - that &apos;s both Clinton as well as Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential candidate , however , are not affected by the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic issue .
among the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , more philosoph@@ ical difference .
he , about the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to hold the doub@@ ts more small and war@@ n before , as the state of economy can harm - with tax and regulation .
Clinton establish the economy to death and regul@@ ate the economy , he says .
he himself would be different , claims of Tr@@ ump .
he will return to regul@@ ators , and he makes himself strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for businesses and businesses .
Clinton said to Clinton : the state has given certain tasks to fulfil , he has dis@@ advant@@ ageous chances to open and needs money .
therefore , taxes were increased for the rich &apos;s wealth , says it .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
to be invested in the committees , Tr@@ ump and Clinton is almost equal .
the democratic candidates announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are rejected by the state @-@ rite part of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so on Tr@@ ump , so you could get more part@@ isan discussion .
clearly visible are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal plants and return the coal output in the USA again .
oil extraction is also expected to be protected in so far protected areas to open the climate agreement in the Paris@@ ian climate agreement .
Clinton intends to enhance renewable energies with its investment program , and calls for &quot; a country the super@@ power of clean energies will create and million jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want to be there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only for the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , both compet@@ itor are not far from each other .
T@@ PP , the immun@@ ity @-@ fish trade agreement , both will not sign .
at the same time both the USA does not want to isol@@ ate from international trade , but simply protect the American jobs .
that should then be paid better , about Clinton requires about Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hungry .
she wants to raise it up to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump in this question is not clear : once again he says : the minimum wage must be , then he says he will not be changed .
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop the fiscal policy of both bearings .
on one side , Tr@@ ump , which aims to boost the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics keep his critics , so that the bud@@ get@@ ary deficit would only be bigger .
on the other hand Clinton , who wants to ask at least of the rich men that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not even the solution .
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost as everyday life .
if they arrive in Germany , they often are traum@@ atic .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is not a year old .
one has laid their little son in the arm .
he gu@@ arded with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother cur@@ b on the tab@@ let@@ op .
until it noted that it will be observed .
she sm@@ iles shortly and kissed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until you speak with Katrin B@@ ahr .
it is the executive director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier of social relief services in Bavaria , and among others , with the theme women on the escape .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry farmers .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alized accommodation for all@@ ap@@ ing women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
un@@ long it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are no - not as visitors .
the exception is a wax before the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated : every woman who comes in here has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars , because they are persecuted polit@@ ically , because of them torture or death , or because their families sent them to Europe as a hopes to Europe . &quot;
in women , there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal secretly , because they don &apos;t see any way out of others . &quot;
in their home , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honorary moral , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this drives them away .
on the run the way goes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , a bottle of water is required for a bottle of water , is no rarity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
those who believe it as soon as they ank@@ ets in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
too , there would be women in refugees too often considered less than mines and worse .
this leads to that approximately 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the north , traum@@ ati@@ zed , estimates it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are not optional voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are as usual that they say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they trusted not to speak openly about that which is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not help to help , there are more accommodation only for them , calls for B@@ ahr .
the seven host@@ els in Bavaria are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether they w@@ alled by a similar project like in Munich in its authority area , answer some with no .
in the Ober@@ p@@ fal@@ z and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are no something in shel@@ ters of governments .
also in weakness , women are not accommodated separately , Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press brie@@ cher of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , sub@@ - and middle fran@@ ken , there are some common floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two main accommodation units exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is missing the privacy , or become men and women together , it can come to - for@@ mid@@ day violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all the shower room should be separated and for women easily accessible , stands in the study .
as much of the women &apos;s need of need , you can read the And@@ alu@@ ur , who gives it to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been familiar with us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
assistant curing : recei@@ v@@ ables based on new labor action
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deputy Assistant for assist@@ ants have called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for their disputes regarding a new agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) demanded its total council effective in early September .
the J@@ DC said that it had been Minister of Ministers regarding the wor@@ ries regarding the agreement .
in July , Assist@@ enz@@ oll@@ ed and Medical studies have voted on the re@@ jection of a contract that has been agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted for the elections .
in a letter to the members , which was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained silent for problems , which was rejected that the contract was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering that , the J@@ DC Board voted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ ject the proposed new contract completely to re@@ ject and official new negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board announced a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to appro@@ ve an ongoing program of climate working measures that begins in the beginning of September .
the disputes led this year , that Assist@@ enz@@ oll@@ ed this year was six times , the first total cases in the history of the N@@ HS .
the leader of the BM@@ A assist@@ ants , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , joined the election of the agreed Terms , which had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions , which were still found before the vote by 54@@ ,000 assist@@ ants and medical studies , with that the contract should be beneficial and supp@@ os@@ edly should be assumed .
in accordance with the voting , the Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt , that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of Foreign Affairs &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce his hands and procla@@ im an official end of the eight months &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defeat of the words and economic sanctions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when Vladimir Putin takes off his Turkish counter@@ player in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in receiving , I cannot accept one of the pres@@ cription for Ankara .
it was the r@@ ash , yes .
but Put@@ ting the sm@@ iles worked sh@@ mal@@ y and it sh@@ ined warm warmth , even for his re@@ lu@@ ding conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said to his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - according to a report of all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said also that relations with Russia could not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better will improve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an would have happened as it would never be a little worse .
to me , his enthusiasm was rather the opposite .
but one of Putin ex@@ ams , sustainable and bol@@ dness revealed that the Russian state of Russia had forgotten nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first , which he mentioned in his introductory statement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the shot of a Russian campaign by Turkey on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moscow reaction to the time was w@@ ut@@ ent@@ ated .
Putin made up and accused Ankara , Russia in the back .
this was even bigger , because it was committed by a thought friend .
to re@@ build the vo@@ cal again , it is difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media had a severe , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once , it seemed , when the Turks would bear for everything the debt .
on the most serious accus@@ ations of conduc@@ tive officials reported that Erd@@ og@@ an had benef@@ ited from illegal oil trade in territories of Syria , which shall be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has fought this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received from President Erd@@ og@@ an to the debt that he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a way victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of an arm@@ ist@@ ice is clear on the hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an needs all friends which he can get from the last month with a failed coup d &quot; coup d &quot; é@@ tat in a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
again , terror attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there is economic moti@@ ves .
Russian sanctions met in Turkey - especially the prohibition of char@@ tered vol@@ cano , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operator and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated if the flights will be resumed .
they are count on a late seasonal harvest of the Mediterranean .
this week , the State &apos;s television exceeds fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imported will be allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i formulated this way : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists long , tomatoes here long &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is going down to the West as the response to the tried power of power tried to over@@ sight the weak response .
to this , the continuing Gro@@ ll come across the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the inv@@ ents on it is to go out from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West .
in Ankara , Russian Minister of State won a bonus for this , that he requested the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat for the selected state organs .
this is well known for Moscow , a self @-@ comprehen@@ si@@ vity , that himself has a deep@@ est fear of rain .
the summit in this glorious palace in the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , one , as it described me a analy@@ st once described , &quot; Alliance of Foreign Affairs &quot; represented : two countries that have off the West and feel po@@ or@@ ly treated and f@@ law@@ ed .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still large differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow was recently the role as pe@@ ac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey will support each other sites .
it could be noted that after almost three hours of first discussions both president told the press conference that they didn &apos;t have the subject .
the President of Turkey avoided it to answer a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this .
there is no unique conf@@ ession about it , where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open host@@ ilities - and given the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster than NATO member Turkey &apos;s Russian combat jet - it is certainly better to talk about the two heads of state .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland are not available
according to the Board of Staff of the Bank , the R@@ BS Board will only be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the Board of Directors .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will be no longer available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan distributed to BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
the bank has since been dist@@ illed since then she had to be saved almost col@@ oll@@ ed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brand has used to protect other end consumer products . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you supported the international sport with millions pound to Spon@@ sor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wimbledon Winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to press more national stamps in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and the stock exchange is to switch to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand will already be used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are others , smaller brands for private customer business , which will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Drum@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WA@@ N was inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he divided the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will be employed to our investment stamp , as well as the brand which our employees will be employed , since we will now become a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we have no global objectives , but pursue local targets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will be entirely different in their own municipalities for something completely different and our employees are working among these brands with the customer .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not be continuing its Six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ship , and will increase the perception of the various brands in his sport Spon@@ sor@@ ing .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop the bank of brands , because we are in the interior ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the chief of Staff .
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical prior to three years ago when we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think that time has come .

I am very emotional because my family is also here
I &apos;m very happy about that it is done at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it is not a great meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ aler Friday evening with 20.000 people .
I am easier and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the Ju@@ bel to win the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction .
two Jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s reached the milestone in the obst@@ acle course - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a recru@@ ited career .

three years ago he was at the beginning of difficulty when he returned from his six @-@ month sper@@ son , but he showed an impressive strength to provoke his branches and to his shape .
and he is not yet a long time at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori in previously said that he wants to continue up at least 5@@ 0,@@ ten years of age .
Russia Putin breath@@ es Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin was un@@ maintenance in the way to his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a lot of years part of the most famous confidenti@@ ality of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed special responsibility for environmental and transport services .
in a statement by the Kre@@ m@@ lin it reads that Putin without speci@@ fying the dis@@ mis@@ sal of Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had joined Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , former diplom@@ at .
born in Tallinn in Tallinn , Germany , in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy .
on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is ( in Russian ) that he later served the Chief Apostle and St@@ abs@@ ction of the Government son@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said about his appointment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activities as a state of Chief of Law and controls on the implementation of your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked for his post to leave his post and have recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious wo@@ unding .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time of a close confidence in Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet secret service , K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , that was broadcast@@ ed on television in television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff has returned to his own request .
but despite the wages for cameras , only few of them are convinced - especially in front of the parliamentary elections .
so here is the result of a sort of power ?
nobody knows that .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who was formerly known as potential president , wants to lead to lead the Russian environmental policy - joined large sk@@ ep@@ ti@@ c@@ sis .
in his remarks on Putin , which will be quoted on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , said Ivan@@ ov &quot; It is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation - one could almost tell me - it could rely four years long .
as it turned out , I &apos;ve been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov recorded the post in December 2011 .
before he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin &apos;s former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , as Putin was chairman of the B@@ und@@ essi@@ anic service ( FS@@ B ) , who was named K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he named Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , to whom he confi@@ ded in most .
once again , Ivan@@ ov could have been elected president of Russia after putting into the second term of office in Russia , as a third term of putting into the constitution .
but this item was taken by another , near allies of Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was Prime Minister before he became president of three and a half years later .

Que@@ ens@@ ing Cross@@ ing : connected bridge to bridge with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion @-@ expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ lav@@ ings by vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - what means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four sealing of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; covers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge cut from Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 circuits .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion @-@ expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister K@@ eit@@ h Brown used a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go out from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ ing river . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of a conc@@ ep@@ tual art by a truly ep@@ ic dimensions in this project with more than 30.000 ton of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the sealing between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a hei@@ gh@@ ing activity , which require extremely precise tolerances for the fit .
overall , almost 79 % of the total bridge will be available at their place and the last section of the deck today gets to Ros@@ y@@ th on the deck , which means that the total deck is ready to be lifted up to its place .
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first clasp is a considerable milestone in each bridge project .
with this fantastic project , the closure of the ground@@ breaking high and deep construction .
after installation of the last road @-@ up and its connection with the Northern @-@ deck @-@ deck , we had to be able to close the gap in the north or land side .
this was reached by pulling the northern wooden bridge 700 millimeters south .
this was a massive and very hot activity .
massive , as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ kt 222 meters long , approximately 6,000 tons weighs and had to be moved up with a gra@@ dient of about 3 % .
heat , since the tolerances , on which the team worked , tiny - at each side , they were only a few millimeters .
fortunately , everything ran very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were cast out of their fishing boat before the Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station was staged on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while their boat was moving from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat in its proximity to turn around and set us the worst thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong wind b@@ lows down the boat except their range , until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third one was exhau@@ sted at the age of 60 and was found on one bo@@ ard@@ y without the li@@ fe@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board of coastal areas and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were cast into the water , have good luck and to be alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Boot@@ ed engine had a stop@@ over one , but it was dissolved during the star@@ ters of the Bo@@ ots from the person who controls the boat .
someone told today about these men .
seriously injured - man st@@ aves to his ex @-@ friend
a man was attacked and wounded his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
as the police announced in yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had given the key to get his personal things .
instead the soft drinks of his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend instead of his ex @-@ friend .
when they came into the apartment , he stopped twice to them .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in hand and body .
the police could determine the perpet@@ rators .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old the clothing of his former l@@ friend , he called his mother .
this al@@ im@@ pover@@ ished then his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother .
but they could not move it to leave the apartment .
therefore she went with their partner from the house .
on the road they met the ex @-@ life partner of man .
when the two women &apos;s home again ro@@ asted , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old draws his sister to the side and took his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend .
who builds brown @-@ silence apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Green said to my : investors will be much stronger in future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how to react to bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manual concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet battle is programmed .
the first line is the question : who should actually build the favourable dwellings ?
one rule is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD faction leader Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are able to build us with gre@@ enery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to build on urban areas , 20 percent of all apartments have to be found as a social apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the favourable dwellings may also arise in its portfolio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the great dispute in the city hall was , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how does one deal with investors that want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build investors on such areas at least 10 percent , but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments as a social apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing program , which will cost millions of cost , and is to be financed for inc@@ enti@@ ve .
the problem , such a fr@@ ying : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make investors as few regulations .
the left is even more hardness levels for investors .
regardless of it , fr@@ ying , ex@@ changing a wear of the situation on the housing market .
the manual concept is implemented , which provide additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the specialists .
but the program does not yet understand : for the approximately 1260 new apartments that should be built @-@ in .
but how do you compare the loss of some 1300 cheap apartments , whose promotion is going to run in the next few years ?
by 2020 , it will be 500 apartments .
to avoid this , the planning office spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city now .
in addition , it would also be thought to pick up apartments back into the price binding .
this is possible in the West@@ stadt .
solve one stroke the problem .
because in the West@@ stadt run at the end of Fri@@ days .
around 1800 apartments could take back home in the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this will not want to do the owners , housing buildings .
because the number of social dwellings in the West city is again dra@@ stically lifted , the goal of the so @-@ called mixture .
a concentration of social weak in just few neighbour@@ hoods should not give it anymore .
the Green Party anticip@@ ate that there will be a movement in the discussion .
Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ ch@@ ke writes : &quot; for a wide majority , the CD@@ U must be with the boat . &quot;
the fact that concentrated on more buildings for family homes .
but what does not mean that no compromise can be found yet .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it &apos;s fascinating , how the world changes .
that te@@ ens and child for games do not go beyond outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time to spend your free time on screens , was compl@@ ained in the last decade of many .
for Pok@@ em@@ on Go there is to pick up people from the sofa and be active .
the time on screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and last to smartphones .
hence , it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities will not include outdoor items .
I &apos;m interested in the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characteristics that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later there was a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture decreased slightly ahead of the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within less days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go has more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go out with their smartphone after outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are persecuted with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( about a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; cap@@ tive . &quot;
one generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the winding and j@@ ump@@ ed to the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the game resulted in a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; person will return every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cardi@@ ac , an app for Apple Watch , which followed 35,000 users , told that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of followed people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent every day .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays of which Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it looks like the raw data for performance improvements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public educational campaigns are to take care of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deaf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deaf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deaf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every day , because many public messages are bor@@ ing to health and bor@@ ing of people who look forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport not be verified .
those who drives regularly sports , reduces its chances to treat cancer or depression .
physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages , which is too long to introduce them here .
but the mira@@ cul@@ ous Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that people bring the people to do something in the open thing that fun is fun .
thus , three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun .
some people close to the hunt even new friends .
as always there are m@@ ashed gam@@ bled , which must always be chargeable over something .
and yes , someone could run against one door .
what should it be ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit already could follow our activity earlier than Fit@@ bit , they gave us no reason to drive sport as it does this game .
new will lose its friction and the use will be followed by the time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more Games to be able to make apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will help many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the ladies
forget the print .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all this immune system .
dynamic on the spr@@ ing@@ horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beams .
stunning on the ground .
on full line brilliant .
and now the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ ó@@ m on Thursday to the majority vote and enlarged the gap between the eyes and the rest of the world in front of all eyes of the Olympic Games .
the overall results of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team kam@@ er@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ neth on the p@@ ig @-@ bal@@ ancing of women in art at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth @-@ h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a majority vote and a total of the fifth , while they prof@@ ane their reputation , the best of their generation or even at all .
they broke down in tears , when her end result was shown and her long journey was found at this moment .
this achievement is reflected in the same division like a unique athl@@ ete , like Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps , who brought their sports at new heights :
Bil@@ es dominated the last three years , 15 world champion , including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary L@@ ou Ret@@ ton said that they have ever seen &quot; the best gymn@@ ast , which I ever seen . &quot;
it was expecting a final examination in Brazil , a contest , which went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not return with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man moved poor , after they have won gold and silver in single multilingual campaign at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she retired in the f@@ arewell party of the team coordinator Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as Aus@@ ru@@ bas@@ signs .
although it was on top of it , during their long way@@ marks on the top , never the future is planned , that is not really true .
part of its floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tail@@ ored to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no co@@ incidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans Mutter during a school trip to the gym , was trained in Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no multi competition competition for the summer 2013 , a winning stre@@ ak , which is such as long as it wishes .
even if Model af@@ ina was slightly truncated through two fil@@ ings , the image destroyed .
sul@@ j@@ bal@@ let and Bo@@ ats - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - l@@ ur@@ k .
she again took over 15,@@ 433 on the p@@ ig @-@ bal@@ loon again - and set it on a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man bo@@ ar@@ red them gently as she expected her du@@ ality - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow@@ ed on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , when the vision described it once in their collection book .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team capit@@ alised , which is called by the Americans &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; a ledge .
after her soil practices , she cast off the public court , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes doub@@ t@@ ful appeared .
what it concerns , so the fast @-@ wide T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a completely new meaning :
police : 3 victims in mass mur@@ der@@ ation when listening to music in the car
according to police report , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girls were shot , killed in one of the killing attacks in one of the most deadly attacks in one decade in the first series of mort@@ ars , while they heard in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah was shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a car , said the authorities .
the perpet@@ rators of eight shots from a hand fire@@ arm , while he was standing on the passenger side of the cars and then fled with another car , is in the report .
the police declared that the triple murder had not been to be the result of a prey that seems to be the attack@@ ers or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who participated in the possession of an adult victims .
the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard told the investigation into the investigation , a closer look at it if it is linked to four previous attacks .
a total of seven persons were killed in four months in nine attacks in nine months and two others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including one brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investigation refused to reveal the evidence that they have committed to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ ital@@ ized due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness divided the police with that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car to sit and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was assumed to an empty pickup truck a half hour before the triple murder and was assumed that it was the work of the series .
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ sen and made a ball out of the seat and ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most of the 6 @-@ year @-@ old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to love the singing , toys and naturally his mother .
but as the least of his aging , Edmund micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorders that knew not his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought , I create it not .
I do not create this .
I did not leave me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s not true -- of course , one has left on it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her was told that Edmund will never realize them under circumstances that he may not survive once .
some doctors also went so far that they struck him to institutional him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to it was I didn &apos;t know that people still wanted to make &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Edmund can run with the help of a walk .
Edmund could neither cra@@ w@@ ling up to his third year of life nor sit cra@@ w@@ ling and he still cannot speak .
but he makes slowly progress .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth is the character language that Edmund for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please follow me something &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring a character language when &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical character language -- says her . Edmund has invented some characters alone .
Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y has a multitude of causes : genetic as well as infections and infections with viruses such as mas@@ king or the z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how to influence the life of the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds of the emotional prize of an un@@ certain future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they are still not really .
I &apos;ve been asked for a long time more after the progn@@ osis because I do not expect that someone can really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful rating for mothers of mamm@@ al with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it is better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and love your child .
severe ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding on satur@@ ation in Louis@@ iana , Mississippi
severe ra@@ ins and large floo@@ ding in Louis@@ iana was forced to call on Friday the emergency , on Friday the not@@ ion of more ra@@ ids .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Louis@@ i@@ anas and the South of E@@ pp@@ is over@@ flow@@ ed their sho@@ res and threatened with severe floo@@ ding in the country of extreme rain@@ forests , the National Weather Service .
the Governor of Louis@@ iana accompanied by John Bel Edwards in contact with local authorities and assistance to the congregations already on the way .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a speaker for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the governor , told that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags multiplied .
Ste@@ ele said that alone , the municipality Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have had ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a floo@@ ding system is used over wide parts in the south Louis@@ i@@ anas until Saturday .
the weather service was abandoned , that additional 3 @-@ 5 inches could fall on rain in this area .
in the South of Alab@@ amas on Friday a Fl@@ ut@@ n@@ war@@ n system was deployed in the area of Mobile .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite in the vicinity of Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Louis@@ iana , all probability reach a record level after the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could floo@@ ded many houses in the presence of Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said also that there is a threat down@@ stream in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish a danger , since those of the rivers flow only slowly to the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the river Ar@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool , Louis@@ iana , on Friday already reached the highest stand , which was ever recorded .
rescue ste@@ ams still people from the flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the southwest of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his st@@ ep@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday in the vicinity of Glo@@ ster .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , overnight in over night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that a further st@@ ep@@ son who dwells near lives , has warned him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are w@@ asted and sh@@ ielded the water and sh@@ ielded in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said H@@ ans@@ ford that she lived there in the 48 years where she lived there , never had such a flood on the river .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that he and his family members could have all the disabilities and he would be swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had been saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated until Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood could quickly spread quickly , because there were heavy rainfall , and that the authorities of evacu@@ ation transfers .
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , ob@@ servers in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning from 13,@@ 75 inches rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floor has been considerably improved by ra@@ ins since Wednesday .
the authorities gave that severe ra@@ ins and road floo@@ ding the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and classes in five school districts .
the C@@ BS @-@ subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a passenger in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which now have been floo@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ruler of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities were 72 people and seven pets were res@@ cu@@ ed from the flood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency accommodations were furnished to lodge the evacu@@ ation .
&quot; once the water starts to return , they will return to their houses , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads have been closed due to high water and sand bags for the residents which hope to hold the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last big flood which we had , was in March &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in fact , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Count@@ ys said that it remained ra@@ iny on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a hand@@ ful of a hand@@ ful houses have been reported on Thursday as floo@@ ded , but not reported on Friday until now .

Mah@@ aj Brown , 6 , &quot; sol@@ dered by balls , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week is already the second time that a 6 year old child is connected .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as a Mah@@ aj Brown .
the grand@@ parents gave that Brown suffered several sh@@ uss@@ ings , including in the evenings , leg , arm and belly , but that he was at his transport into hospital with consciousness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has made much , his small body was pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he divided his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the condition of the boys was considered critical in a hospital as critical and he had to under@@ go to several operations .
the family of the boys divided the transmitter that it is expected to recover .
he had to start the first class in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people to be connected in German@@ town .
also there were three men : two of the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in the critical state ; the other two victims are in a stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was placed on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who is located in a critical condition , called the transmitter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police have just been determined whether one of the last men &apos;s offen@@ ders could be found .
investigations distributed to C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seemed to be a cross between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ances for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ cked back to various assault ri@@ f@@ le , over@@ threw the facts .
it seems that it clearly shows a continuous battle .
on the road , on both sides of the walking distance , the sleeves were found .
so it seems to have been given several armed fighters who were very actively involved , &quot; shared police skin Anthony G@@ inal@@ di the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no fixed ass@@ ump@@ tions and the police have been reported to report the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 year old girl was hit by a trans@@ verse R@@ ack@@ et on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane .
they re@@ covers and the police is looking for a susp@@ ects .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what I agree to myself among the women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ age in the Tur@@ ns and that of more than a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have been doing so dominant since 1984 at every summer Olympic Games and the USA were never so dominant .
and second : this team has three gymn@@ ast , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired for many young girls of other skin colour inspir@@ ing .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ kin is round , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the United States .
it has the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of these sport .
during the past four years , the number one was one of the female gymn@@ ast , a A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
in the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas had a surprising Olympic winner in and America .
now the world was able to be the witness of the incredible performance of the three times world championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they unexpected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ics rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won the gold medal for women in an individual majority event .
Mann@@ er member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the tip of this sport , but they do not see turn@@ outs throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it to the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympics is only four gymn@@ ast in the team . in addition , she is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as trainer .
but the reality looks so that Tur@@ ns is a expensive sport , and Turner in first line into private gy@@ ms , which will hold their parents , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainer and their Turner and families ) . the list can be changed .
the majority of these turn@@ around lie in well @-@ hab@@ itats , which can support business .
in these verses , the Turner receive its entire training and it &apos;s for the families a te@@ ures and long term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athletes since they started with the Tur@@ ns .
we have to in@@ numer@@ able the congregations Au@@ n in@@ numer@@ able , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy access to access .
I founded my Turn@@ stiftung from 20 years ago .
with my events we have commanded free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban teenagers ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winner .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth of high @-@ quality gymn@@ asts , which will earn the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sports .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and destination for the mind .
this combination offers life benefits for health and professional success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the tur@@ tle and that &apos;s great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s so important to participate in sport , especially for girls .
this is an so exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team gold and thank you for how many young girls are motiv@@ ated to begin their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women .

culture of the Political Cor@@ rection ness makes elec@@ trop@@ hi@@ ed in Muslim oppos@@ e
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on corruption of a government report due to corruption from the ministry .
a culture of the Political Cor@@ respon@@ ness has led to this , that far more common election was ig@@ no@@ red in Muslim churches , such as a destruction government report today revealed .
Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es , the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es banned the police , election observation and Rath@@ en@@ houses to have ig@@ no@@ red by mis@@ conduct regarding eth@@ no and religion . &quot;
the former minister of integration and municipal government , which is now a ant@@ ce@@ rup@@ tion@@ ing , said that it should be permitted to protect the police out of religious moti@@ ves that it should be permitted to protect the police outside of elec@@ trol@@ ytes , to protect the voters .
he recommends that voters should carry out a ID to prove their identity in elections .
at that time , a voters must name only its name and address .
the report suggests , non @-@ remove ink on the finger of a person , when it cho@@ oses their vote to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , Sir Eric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he calls for the press more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official commis@@ sions or working groups should have . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only against voting , but is also the communist government in front of the wider corruption and financial instruments that goes down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by the Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election as a result of the east London .
last year , a special vote decided that the Mayor of mayor Lut@@ on for Rah@@ man should be corrupt after a Lit@@ an@@ ei at corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of His Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ n@@ ical manner , &quot; and that he had brought his critics with rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us@@ - and Islam@@ op@@ hob@@ ic accus@@ ations to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have led his campaign on the basis that the cor@@ related duty of Muslims be to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either des@@ per@@ ate or a consequence of a rep@@ lica when one person has chosen one person .
Sir Eric said that there was no more fraud in the whole country .
he expressed in particular al@@ ar@@ ming to the fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent post@@ mark - when the older members of the Muslim community had made pres@@ cription of people to choose one candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to clean the elec@@ toral system , including the fo@@ t of evidence to prove the identity
in his report it is said : &quot; as proof was appropriate that pressure on protection measures of some eth@@ ical min@@ orities have been exercis@@ ed , in particular women and young people , in order to choose with the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pakistan or ban@@ quet background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; polit@@ ically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consider@@ ations relating to Eth@@ nie and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition against political activists , to stop &quot; elec@@ toral harvest . &quot;
the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May , is required to prevent the tough@@ er registration testing , to prevent the elec@@ toral directory of immigration and social gu@@ err@@ ations .
options in consideration , voters want to ask for your selection after your selection .
not remove ink on the finger of one person , as soon as they were submitted to prevent their voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic belie@@ fs relating to the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limited limitation to mot@@ ions on an automatic post@@ mark .
ban that political activists complete the complete set of letters and env@@ elop@@ es of letters .
the police give the fug@@ iti@@ y to create ab@@ brevi@@ ations around vot@@ er stations .
a law change , which makes an indictment for in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Liability Act 1983 ) .
photograph@@ ing in elec@@ toral stations .
requirement that only English in the elec@@ toral stations may be used ( except of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training , to ensure that the employees are generally consistent that voters go to the election alone .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ lets fall no penalty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ toral court has Lut@@ on for Rah@@ man and his deputy for damages of corrupt and illegal practices as unt@@ au@@ ral , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons for reasons , he was found guilty on the basis of the high demands on the grounds of the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he critic@@ ises the most effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the elec@@ toral members of the Town H@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Court of Justice in Tower Ham@@ lets from the last year was a warning signal .
our country carries a proud heritage as the mother of par@@ liam@@ ents , but the concern and covered spread of election was thre@@ aten and void of some authorities .

the buyer does not know where they should see when a woman moved their clothes in the midst of a Pri@@ mark to try underwater .
in order to send the situation , they numbered , as it looked in it , she went out , and laid it back into the shelf .
she went on and tested four pairs of sub@@ p@@ ants in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , one .

&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of p@@ ants from the out@@ lay , moved out their own str@@ ut@@ ures and tro@@ users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was not tried to find a little dis@@ crete place to do it - it was simple as Oskar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each star@@ red when she with@@ drew off the sub@@ tro@@ users , who did not like them , since they set it again into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other sub@@ ths before they finally decided that you didn &apos;t see anything , and went away again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seemed not to be distur@@ b that som@@ ebody had observed or think about the person who would buy sub@@ p@@ ants under circumstances that they had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. David@@ son , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to think that anyone would take a sub@@ tro@@ users with home , who had another person who had not been washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. David@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to go out the clothes from the sale after it was just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate it with a new pair of sub@@ p@@ ants to go home and find out that another woman she had an@@ gled and didn &apos;t get washed away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; if you turn off from the back , then you should see yourself as a refresh@@ er , so that you can see your att@@ acker , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
take the weapon for your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you beat the face with your free el@@ bow .
then beat him with the k@@ nee in the vest and rotate the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move in down@@ wards , while keeping the weapon on him .
when attack@@ ers are coming from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the scra@@ p line , take the weapon and turn them away , so that the attack@@ ers can &apos;t shoot .
store the weight at the same time , beat the attack@@ ers on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its handle , before moving back and set the weapon on him .
sounds difficult ?
see the video to see how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that it is at a prey on the saf@@ est , your money is too exc@@ essive - if you are no Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ masters .
Reis@@ ender Ian Wright sh@@ ank you for a guide to the most interesting places in Europe
a British travel instru@@ c@@ ated its immune system and co@@ aches of a serious test by changing some of the most tast@@ est and most precious places of Europe .
the present@@ er and travel agent Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ olk sch@@ aked his course on a Euro @-@ Sch@@ ein , a ban@@ ist@@ band of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to provide the resistance to its immune system under proof .
in front of the back@@ side of each object he used a l@@ umin@@ omet@@ res to show up and to show us what he will get .
but the experiment with the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was filmed , brought some surprising results in daylight .
the thought , the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a train toilet , which was already used by thousands of others , may be totally imper@@ vious to be in a kitchen molecules more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr Wright , with doctors and medical staff on the promotion of intest@@ inal bacteria , as well as his own health .
fortunately , nothing left nothing , and more than a bad taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of his gut when he travelled through the world and ate great things as well as wonderful things .
from public funds to train stations up to r@@ ins@@ ing buttons of toilets , the task assigned its immune system definitely under a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he told , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ careful what my health is concerned and I put all possible things in my mouth , Earth , wor@@ ms and mud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film , he became righteous to his call .
the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test line showed a L@@ umin@@ omet@@ rics count of over 4000 units .
in comparison , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry number amounts to less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to depart after their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ rics number over 4000 units , while fresh@@ ly washed hands had one of less than 60 .
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products vali@@ dating the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different places such as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That comes the worst thing which I have taken in a toilet , close &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing dirt more than that !
I will not know anything here , because it is in@@ scri@@ bed here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ d .
the company stat@@ uses Mr. Wright with validation of validation , which contains both mil@@ actic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intest@@ inal bacteria and immune system .
validation Senior Venice President for Snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumers really something new .
something that is fascinating , and the benefits of Pro@@ biotics explained at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings with this means that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass contact us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they asser@@ ted that interest in intest@@ inal health is become a global phenomenon
instead of just about the products we wanted to speak in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intest@@ inal health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in intest@@ inal health is a global phenomenon , and with the documentary we could provide consumers more information on an interesting way .
I think it shows that the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ or !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the director of the film , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tast@@ ed some of the things which I had instructed him , such as the ek@@ y Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there were things that it was easier to bring Ian to bring them to , and others , with which it was pretty difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we have recorded some of these dirty paintings on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in one of validation conducted in 2015 , 84 percent of those survey@@ ed Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illi in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they must be able to use mil@@ actic acid bacteria .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a medi@@ al family left their social apartment after a delay of £ 50,000 , because they had terror@@ ized their neigh@@ bors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tan@@ ya sk@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after having been removed from their estate , sho@@ cked employees of housing estate found ownership in an ir@@ repar@@ able state .
the walls exp@@ elled holes on wood floors , rub@@ b@@ ish have been torn down on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated on walls .
the family were settled and it is believed that they now lives in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the hom@@ ologation of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it is not afraid that the apartment is no longer repair .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare here and I am the view that people don &apos;t need to live in this way .
there are many things to be considered as this property is probably considered a beautiful part of the Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ ori@@ ous and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , the meantime lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror which had added to the family , street children with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ying , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking , drug traff@@ icking , drug traff@@ icking , drugs and floods .
sk@@ el@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , got an arrangement for ant@@ iso@@ ara behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house that will be demolished in circumstances , the cold rub@@ b@@ ish has been found
it was done in the estate in which in the past of drugs , wooden frames were torn
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eigh@@ bours said that they were fighting on the road and had to be called on regular police regularly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing served them and their partners this week for@@ ci@@ bly from the property after they gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to exp@@ ires voluntarily .
the Del@@ og@@ ation were sh@@ out of facilit@@ ated neigh@@ bors who said that her life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were not ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years apart from them and it was always bad .
the countless times , which we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today , we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet - that &apos;s not always lived here !
now , wherever they are gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ our@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing said that it had been ab@@ sent the family with local authorities to co@@ operate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called in regular intervals , 20 years long .
on the superior side of the municipal house , gar@@ bage and old toys were cast down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant had given to take any responsibility for their behavior and to their family , as a delay is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing is considered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was a very difficult case , because the behavior was extremely difficult and their do@@ ings had to be terrible to their neigh@@ bors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall and members of the church , who went to us , and have made us the information to come . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that the development of some neigh@@ bors who will don@@ ate and share the message that ant@@ iso@@ ara &apos;s behavior is not toler@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Donald Tr@@ ump Ac@@ t ″ Power Problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , also in traditionally conservative states , their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave the weak@@ nesses of his campaign campaign in the existing Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Utah .
a rare moment , where the usually great @-@ track and self @-@ safe Mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire reported as something like concerns , such as correspon@@ dents .
after having thrown 16 Riv@@ ets within their own Republi@@ can camp , the doub@@ ts of his success grow in the fight for the White House .
&quot; we have massive problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for assistance in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
to bl@@ ame are false reports about his candidate , he resumed his well @-@ known media .
Republi@@ can high bur@@ s@@ ling
Utah normally is a safe bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ or in June , Tr@@ ump and his competitors from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , at the same time .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that is usual for republi@@ can candidates in the state of state .
as endangered species , Arizona and Georgia also apply .
in an interview with the Sen@@ se CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question as he did to stop the way of Clin@@ tons , as I did so far so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and whether back : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either a successful one , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he do not require anything else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not rich for him at the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is the order that Tr@@ ump continues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , Tr@@ ump sum should be threatened to submit funds to support his election campaign , it should not be able to present any better recovery values .
instead of what would be the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans for the congress stronger among the arms .

because of the hard ancest@@ or of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an , in accordance with the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish Municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short @-@ term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I reck@@ oned with ten thousands of wages , medium term with some hundred thousand protective seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime further fought the min@@ orities and democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the presi@@ ding chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government already passed away in the months of Kur@@ dish Hoch@@ bur@@ gen , 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey on the flight .
after the failed coup and se@@ cular ethnic Turks were added after the failed p@@ utsch .
many are new in Europe when they are going to re@@ pressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes refugees to refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of Staff accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ ev@@ it@@ alian cities .
thus , Erd@@ og@@ an would increase the export pressure to the remaining cran@@ ks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of Staff demanded that the Federal Government is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp like Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and its trailer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel no longer in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are searching for asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ elle .
the fire mark as a Gü@@ len tra@@ ilers , teachers and other graduates of the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not fit and trem@@ bled , sitting on the packed caffeine , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and sow@@ ing , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper filed under appeal on numbers of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks determined the largest group of political persecution on behalf of political persecution in Germany before the coup .
at the reporting date June 30 , this is 11.@@ 386 people and that almost 29 percent of all than as@@ yl@@ ar has been recognized ( 3@@ 9.@@ 625 ) .
in this survey not the war , poverty , or Per@@ tiv@@ el@@ ess@@ ness pl@@ ess@@ ness .
asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are exclusively polit@@ ically , i.e. from nation@@ ally side , individual publ@@ ishers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where it does &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the loc@@ als will receive nothing from summer campaign with - and vacation from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not choose the Parliament .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood them .
2021 will not be held by the Parliament election directly at the end of the summer holidays . in the beginning of the year , the Parliament has decided already in the beginning of the year .
as far as so far , it does not work : summer holidays , heat and land battle - that is to be affected .
the loc@@ als that are convinced by the election campaign , are on vacation .
most of the most holidays that are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are no loc@@ als , so are not allowed to choose the country .
we are practical problems : in the holiday there are hel@@ per to divide the posters , air bal@@ lo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , and count on the end of the votes only tired .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last Feri@@ h@@ day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again leave the election campaign against the people over itself .
hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just started .
and there &apos;s also something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his ministry .
the SPD , the most powerful party since 1998 , is now clear behind the CD@@ U .
exciting , such as busy new@@ bor@@ ing Af@@ D , and what remains at the end of co@@ al@@ ous aug@@ ur@@ ably .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years of age and head of Prime Minister , makes an almost in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous campaign of campaign , one sees from his grand@@ parents .
he travels across the country , spread ro@@ ses and pl@@ au@@ ts a little with the people , as it was already legendary in Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise the soul received cold feet and gives ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Merkel the bl@@ ame of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We do that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have accelerated the rise of the sp@@ op@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful post office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with their nickn@@ ary candidates , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ i@@ osity , has already experienced , as it is when you make a false time at the right place .
she has invited twice German Chancellor Angela Merkel to major exploration ; Merkel of the German Bundestag are in the northeast .
but the target group agreed not , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accused Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary @-@ General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there were also no one who list@@ ened from other corners of Germany , even Angela Merkel .
otherwise the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U reno@@ un@@ ces the usual election campaign on market places and front of shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ l@@ las and air bal@@ lo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ated role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union also noted that you have the base of the base that it must be very severe , again a wire to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like the left , the SPD , the Green Party , hardly available in the times of the country .
however , the Council of the CD@@ U @-@ vot@@ er co@@ ders is also self @-@ adhesive : &quot; you need to go where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much on the game has Sell@@ ering has called Sell@@ ering its SPD now to a particularly dedicated elec@@ toral campaign .
in terms of surveys the Socialists and Democrats were last modified 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 , the SPD had already won with 3@@ 5.6 percent in front of CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the gre@@ enery , small par@@ ab@@ bey with seven percent in the surveys , to create the jump into the land .
they make a modern T@@ ug@@ h holiday in the holiday of need and lay their campaign large part in the internet .
&quot; online election campaign &quot; is the chairman Claudia Müller .
otherwise , the green elec@@ toral campaign for loc@@ ust@@ s to loc@@ als are among the holiday homes .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the nickn@@ ary fighter , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a house@@ boat by the Mecklenburg Lake Lakes and is also beautiful .
your impression : &quot; election vacation in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : host sites suffer from blocking
at the speed , with which the B 27 turns , there is nothing to be cont@@ ag@@ ious .
for the persons responsible for the construction work which begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning , and only at 20 o &apos;clock there are all praise to praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have made everything pretty z@@ ag , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no default .
the construction site could be moved to south at the weekend , until the end of October is to be finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blessed is also responsible for the construction persons responsible for the construction of accommodation supplies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site on Monday to the south , and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and thus also the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg , the traffic situation is relaxed within the place .
the citizens can now travel back on both sides by O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 .
the way to return through the place seems to return .
&quot; there were partially considerable complaints , &quot; says the responsible representative of the restoration management of Florian King for the restructuring management .
the residents of Bach@@ ar@@ straße , Capri@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many ra@@ ins sought out and rather familiar with their Nav@@ i in the signs .
what led to man@@ ger trucks in residential areas .
since the speed limit is not observed , the municipality demanded the impact vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant out@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself a spot on the location . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were already two to three per minute .
the quick@@ est speed was on the speed of 77 kilometres per km in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
it has been on the construction site since the construction site is still a qui@@ eter since the construction site .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg is now open the road again .
in the maps , business people will not look like .
but that the B 27 re@@ development of them has led to them in sales , everybody is asking him .
but some more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who has to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less to do so for other firms , the restoration has hardly consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even when Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er speaks Thomas Sul@@ z of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most slight decrease , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drive is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the strongest , the local travels along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already existing .
not only him , but all the guest rooms have &quot; hard hit . &quot;
they were missing the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we need to be happy about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the net sales rose to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the street children have been thrown down for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must have put away half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half had been dischar@@ ged , the policy would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , government Chairman Jörg Schmidt on a request of G@@ öh@@ ner , whether it could give a financial compensation to the restaurant , which also benef@@ ited from the advantages of the position on the B 27 . now they are also the dis@@ advantages that result in the restoration .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where something was generous .
in all cases , G@@ öh@@ ner is safe to continue its restaurant .
finally , the family @-@ run company has already been settled here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history .
that other pe@@ as@@ ants are now less common to the complicated traffic guide less frequently , he can understand .
if one can not drive , it is also beautiful .
that his stem cli@@ ent@@ el returned to the end of the renovation works , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the cr@@ ises of BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner keeps the effects of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in their long @-@ term history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
we are constantly screw@@ ed in the name of terror control .
following the recent proposals , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick security package .
but what has a Dul@@ ce status with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is happy .
all his proposals are polit@@ ically concerned , &quot; polit@@ ician , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security package .
they are disp@@ leased .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also involved myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister of the Interior should be found on results and on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sen@@ sus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère has given a little time after the most recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , before having presented his conclusions for the safety in the republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they now fall more extensive .
a lot is already known , announced , announced : that a new security authority around the cra@@ ck is to take care , is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the fact that Germany has to implement several EU specifications for passenger data and arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is also un@@ surprising .
for the part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second attempt to suggestions that had previously not been able to do with the SPD : he wants to make sympath@@ etic for terror groups under punishment and jihadists with double citizenship to the German pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ Man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he still hold this still for reasonable and challenging nothing , nothing at the coalition partner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few new ideas to be presented by Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are partly in itself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is planning fast procedures for p@@ ush@@ es and more possibilities to the exp@@ atri@@ ation of people in front of the deportation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees who are targeted specifically to be brought into the country , should check their smartphones and check social media accounts for security verification .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if the asylum seek@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for asylum seek@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wants to move some worse than so far - such that criminal off@@ ences or cast their papers to susp@@ end their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of them is polit@@ ically and legally heated .
man@@ ches even works un@@ equ@@ ips and can be asked questions .
and with some points - in the im@@ balance of thought to the example - the question arises : what does that actually do with safety and terror ?
Yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it &apos;s important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not possible to speak that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of high refugee figures , many people are wor@@ ried about safety .
and things that were in deep@@ ening people , let not let themselves also be cl@@ amped in campaign times .
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
first attack in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the in@@ safegu@@ arding is large .
and Yes , there are election campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union and the SPD don@@ ates increasingly on the topic of inner safety . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past days , it was high between the two parties .
only a gar@@ st@@ ive dispute over the features of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some global Unions , in which the ma@@ ort@@ ch@@ iefs can also ask for a return of double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also moves here to reconc@@ iling sounds .
he is nothing from a return from a double pass .
we satis@@ fying the discussion in Germany .
it is not reasonable to do it .
and with a Bur@@ ka @-@ ban , he pleaded not guilty by constitutional concerns .
whether his own package is un@@ fixed at all corners and whether it actually is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it must first show itself .
it &apos;s quite a lot , what could fight for war .
but the SPD is currently being able to pro@@ filing on the topic of internal safety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; scores Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alled just a lot of conversation and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to speak about everything that contributes to safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another Volkswagen gli@@ mp@@ se comes from .
despite diesel engines , the delivery pay worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs .
in the recall action there is a term for a term .
Volkswagen starts for deliveries in the second half @-@ year .
in the previous year , Europe &apos;s biggest automobile industry can continue to continue with its many brands and some well @-@ run markets , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ wide markets .
but in July , the nuclear state VW was weaker primarily in Western Europe and thus loaded the sale again , as described in the D@@ ax listed company .
worldwide , the VW brand sold in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries around almost a sixth month .
brand leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July , primarily on two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , in some core markets , it also has changed economic conditions &quot; in some core markets . &quot;
in addition to the situation round about the coup attempt in Turkey , British vote came out from the EU , explained a spokesperson .
in the USA , where the exhaust gas aff@@ air first es@@ cal@@ ated , is also further a min@@ us to be@@ ech .
large cap for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the primarily affected house brand of the Lower Saxony is further gli@@ mp@@ ed by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only a delivery minus 0.9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles are available .
Group Leader Fred Kap@@ pler was able to refer to a sales point from January to July .
in this period , 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered in this period , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manip@@ ulated with a software tests .
in Germany alone , VW is calling for around 2.5 million cars to re@@ armament into the workshops .
in the course of re@@ armament , the re@@ modelling of cars has no negative effects .
after re@@ armament of vehicles , reduce fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power no wor@@ sen@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bus stop the customer after upgrading a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but say not of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was called on Friday in the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason to be legal issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has published its German customers now a guarantee for diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed last Monday VW @-@ representatives in the Federal Ministry of Finance .
from the Ministry of Transport was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fulfil the recording of my investig@@ ational commission and the KBA &apos;s KBA integration process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; deviations of these are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Office Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry .
VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after conversion has no wor@@ sen@@ ing and all typical relevant car values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was called in business circuits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the wide term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Guaran@@ tee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility for example a half year after upgrading to a workshop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and this could return to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also in customer interest , it is important to avoid for any other damage caused nothing to do with the sc@@ andal that comes to in@@ safegu@@ arding with regard to possible warranty claims , as it was called .
therefore we use the term &quot; guarantee &quot; guarantee .
the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund is required by rich savings in the future - as the second Institute in Germany .
ban@@ kers Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; it &apos;s just around 139 customers , which accounts for 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German Ban@@ ks speaks of a single incident and sees it no signal : normal savings needs to pay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pay for their savings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wareh@@ ouses money over night at the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , you need to pay 0.4 per cent of pen@@ alties .
this fee will be requested by Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily basis .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 cost to be 400 Euros in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has spent 40 million euros that could be withdrawn from one day to the others and that he could not understand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bank account for me at the Central Bank account and cause 0.4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bank head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every Million 4000 Euro . &quot;
the cost is now subject to the customer @-@ ach@@ er@@ principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash just in the saf@@ es of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve experienced four consider@@ ations , I &apos;m not even the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bank Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers have understanding and changes to other investment forms .
only few emigrated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the EC@@ B caused considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you alone bear alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating temperatures not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , some German banks have therefore increased their charges for account , credit cards or transfers .
the Thuring@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burg country had made head@@ lines in 2014 with criminal cases for deposits of three million euros .
Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive director of the Bank Association , said : &quot; we expect to pay attention to in@@ sol@@ es for deposits , with the competition in Germany , among banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cli@@ ent@@ ele give it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cli@@ ent@@ ele , which is a little l@@ ush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be the problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is free for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank of G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ don@@ ors , Kre@@ uth , and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region , famous actors , athletes and entrepren@@ eurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooperative association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently no further banks , which charge an out@@ set for deposits by private clients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the German National Ban@@ ks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ strasse ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold , to go to the private customer , is very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the competition is hard , and it threat@@ ening the emig@@ ration of An@@ leg@@ gi to the competition .
customers in Germany are not leaving in the width .
Dest@@ ination plates : who bu@@ ys sound records ?
lon@@ ely men love medium @-@ aged plates .
before you go to comment in order to transmit him under the pseud@@ onym &apos; non @-@ alg@@ al @-@ patient @-@ patient @-@ patient age , this statement runs from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the versatile recovery of sound plates do not want to welcome to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to welcome the re@@ alism of physical objects , but due to Mid@@ life @-@ nost@@ al@@ gic .
those who have recently purchased a record , are all fo@@ resi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most prob@@ able cat group .
there is also no hormon@@ es through hob@@ b@@ ys@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older plate runners retain their feelings to spend ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but agree the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would follow news report on TV , I would like to follow me in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o , while I stand still in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o , before I stand , my hands hold and something like : &quot; so let &apos;s let us take a closer look . &quot;
so let &apos;s throw at a glance .
even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os is slowly gathering at his charm , hotels , restaurants and offices are now complete the buildings where independent sellers are based - there is a hand@@ ful of fantastic record stores .
I would probably ask the camera of camera to switch the camera for the next part , in which I stand in the immediate vicinity of different men in such stores and try to estimate their age and mind through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I of S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men mean age ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men mean age ) , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , ask I ?
&quot; I think , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these sound plates , above the top ( he sent me to the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I was not followed by him ) , suffer from the walls of his room .
the reason why it owns an such significant number of albums and singles , the result of its available income : it is now able to buy records , which he did not have appeared to buy and again objects which he sold , when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 1960s , early &apos; 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought something too young was to buy them , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is true that those who buy the plates , are more v@@ ending , and would like to spend some time , and adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink not much . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my f@@ aster .
We@@ z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , believes also that many customers who hits the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who heard about the com@@ eback and to buy their old records .
of the convers@@ ations that I have led , people were generally emp@@ t@@ ained about 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers that were once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
that would explain the boom of a certain age of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
it just takes some seconds in a business such as phon@@ ica to recogn@@ ise that disk stores offers a s@@ oo@@ thing community of equ@@ ival@@ ents .
according to We@@ z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some plate fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to return to the stability of confi@@ ded sound quality env@@ elop@@ es , of objects that are happy to don@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or property of material property than a kind of comfort &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is with me as a collector and I think it is so many people so .
it is a simple way to employ spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fl@@ utes a staff from a turn@@ tables . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of IC@@ M revealed that almost 50 % of people that have bought a plate almost 50 % of people who have not heard the last month .
the pol@@ l found that 41 % have had a record player whom they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , do not have a record player .
at that time of the news report I would probably look very concerned while I bl@@ ush through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , the sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men mean age ) works , has a &quot; t@@ rophy &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ val .
&quot; someone came first out here , and said , &quot; I have no record player but I would like to buy a radi@@ i sound plate , so that I can put it into the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage but it happens definitely .
more productive loads , less musi@@ kl@@ es .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older , who first come slowly .
F@@ opp , dedicated to the Schall@@ platten , almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience , than I must go .
there are couples around 70 , tourists , pictures , teenagers and women aged aged .
even if the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the af@@ o@@ rem@@ enti@@ oned shops - Wild Be@@ verage the latest syn@@ thes@@ izers and right @-@ pack@@ et pop instead of experiments - is it good to see such diversity in the customer .
none of them se@@ awe@@ ed out , but n@@ ag@@ ious mental trau@@ mat@@ a are difficult to be ordered when you stand for 30 seconds next to someone .
El@@ an@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the shop for some minutes and considered the variety of plates for sale .
she is more sh@@ atter@@ ed as a man@@ nequ@@ in .
they deser@@ ves not much , therefore the collecting of records does not make any real option , says it .
it costs much .
it is easy to hear from a computer or other way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; they drives with a sl@@ anted sig@@ h .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is really unique .
my last stop is a shop that is said that a new generation of record lovers will have inspired : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the note that Je@@ ans Hot@@ p@@ ants watches , I observe a group of young teen@@ ager eras to buy a group at Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter refused to buy a cro@@ w record player .
on the left , there is a staircase , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential panels for an average collection .
no one sees them - perhaps because they are only p@@ urely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to set it .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that each attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers in the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more then there is nothing to be har@@ der .
there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others , even the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates .
even if my research projects showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v must vote , at least in place @-@ shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record people who exist in reality , record business and online games .
these people probably work hard in school or in offices .
they did not spend their Thursday morning with security services through plate stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through records , while they are taking away an un@@ secret , 30 @-@ year old false present@@ er , which rises not aged over the shoul@@ ders of middle @-@ aged men .

French Court ref@@ uses a demol@@ ition from shops in the jung@@ le refugee camp
a French court rejected one of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jung@@ le of Cal@@ ais , live in thousands of refugees living in the jung@@ le .
at a trial , the authorities argu@@ ed this week argu@@ ed the authorities in Cal@@ ais that people should provide 72 pro@@ vision@@ ing shops within the camp of goods , selling cigarettes or tea for 50 cents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or a simple meals for a few Euros in Pro@@ visional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais Pre@@ fecture argu@@ ed that these places might be torn down because it would be a parallel economy that would be paid out of no tax and a fire @-@ risk @-@ risk .
humanitarian groups distributed to the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals that are offered by the nation@@ ally supported union and other groups , not sufficient food for growing numbers in the camp .
in addition , they led out that the Pro@@ visional Business and restaurants often have accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ulsion of people who operate the 72 pro@@ visional business , but dre@@ amed that the concerns of the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture are completely re@@ plac@@ eable . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the grocery stores , cafes , and restaurants would be playing much larger role as merely people live , which live &quot; in extremely competitive conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of peaceful meet points between refugees and volunteers offer .
one of the places which was threatened by defe@@ ats was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is a profit @-@ profit and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as coun@@ sel@@ ing for asylum applications , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to make the kids &apos; café .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany R@@ aser must be set to the next generation of velocity years : in different federal states , among other things in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested particularly effective .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic @-@ acting En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example to accidents , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction or to san@@ itation bridges , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure the speed limit for the speed limit@@ ing .
a more durable mobile building can be too dangerous or complex .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is autonomous : its battery holds five days , the case data is transmitted via a modem .
in addition to laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be recorded at the same time .
variable speed limit@@ ations as well as passage rate according to time , strip strips and vehicle class are also able to monitor .
in highly respected state you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer coupling .
so that it is not simply st@@ oned , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels were cut in the covered and by the way too sh@@ ank .
furthermore a built @-@ in alarm system is intended to protect blood pressure before V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to the data of Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and now also used .
even foreign authorities bl@@ oss@@ oms with the new technology : recently , France has reduced 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain recovered silver in 7 @-@ seater Rug@@ by , after Fiji Master@@ class Gold recovered
the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ seater Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday evenings during the last hur@@ dle at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated by a 43 @-@ 7 De@@ od@@ oro Stadium in Rio .
Fiji had a master class in the handling , side @-@ st@@ epp@@ ing , back @-@ back , liner and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic wa@@ ist in any color .
the defeat has been reconc@@ iled to the Silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the significant defeat of the Bo@@ ys , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ final on the same day could return to them in the final .
but regardless of this , Fiji had been defeated a 15 @-@ man team in the form of this form .
it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it is probably not that at least one Br@@ ite will hang a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ryan , the former Chief of England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path behind .
eight years ago she lost under Ryan every game with the Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this folder will be we@@ aving , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji began wonderful and caused the attacks of GB@@ S out of sp@@ ass .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . on , when you run in driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au went down to the corner .
with another four minutes playing time Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i has another attack out of the right corner which he walked .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly has the ball .
a he@@ avi@@ est T@@ ack@@ le from Mitchell stops the mountain of Man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third gate , but the Fiji stopped only .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a came in the right corner a touch@@ down and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one for the re @-@ fi@@ ff and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ v@@ ou pre@@ ished by further weak hop@@ per of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is so far as Fiji had been born to play the 7 , while the GB are still common .
it is so too .
GB introduced basic changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ ic gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the ratios of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran after a brilliant intermediate play from Fiji .
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 but the game was already waiting for a long term in the South West Germany , whose fans sn@@ akes , flags til@@ ted and d@@ anced on the triumph@@ al .
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame set the i bag bag with another attempt in the last seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff @-@ ön@@ te , the Fi@@ j@@ is im@@ pover@@ ished and the GB are struck down and struck down in the lawn .
earlier on the day Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 defeated and the Great Britain pressed South Africa in a kno@@ b match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion to the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive foot labour and achieved a gate under the post in the second half .
a brilliant late t@@ ack@@ ling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured winning - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the cancer of the trainer for rowing victory
there will be no bi@@ ode@@ ficiency gold as with these games and that will be hot .
from the first rowing until the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve that enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in her golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who were sitting on the Ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the Echo of the trainer Robin Williams was present , the first women in the history of British Sports , who laid a scale of such a scale .
your domin@@ ance was absolute , after all of you get 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ stable operation , which is also exempl@@ ary .
what we see are two brilliant science within the surface of the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the kind of triumph@@ s .
behind each gold in the Ru@@ ders , a batt@@ al@@ ion was given to grants the difference and there was no more useful than the trainer who would not survive the day before 30 months , when he was diagnosed with cancer when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do it , he spreads to everywhere .
it would have been a rather worse situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could be in the beginning of 2014 , out of the season , could start what the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if this is the right term at all .
I needed money , therefore I needed to go better again soon .
it was an inc@@ enti@@ ve .
I was in hospital and ran at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
so it begins .
the rowing to itself is a challenge , but this makes it a bigger one .
in the in@@ fertil@@ ity of the victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a ner@@ ve morning to speak somewhat more than otherwise , and tried to process his own fears .
St@@ anning , which was as cent@@ ur@@ ion at the Royal Art@@ illery Reg@@ iment in an operation in Afghanistan , &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck . this is perhaps something extremely fast , but it means so much . &quot;
it is repeated only how much of me is how much I and Helen and Robin have worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would have no one , therefore a massive thank you for him . he is the best coach of the world .
I would have no better person for trainer or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race in the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponent could not keep up .
even during the last 500 meters , when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark started to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in process , lead in the process . &quot;
it is really important to rip off .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make something Tol@@ les .
we wanted no fire@@ works today , we wanted to get a good result , going out and win the race , what we did .
the pair will take for one year before it will make decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV adventures of Steve Back@@ shall .
just want to enjoy the moment .
I would not say that it was my last race .
this would have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
it feels like much better , &quot; she said .
31 years of exempl@@ ary for clarity
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ s group &quot; group , R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , will reti@@ re .
the association is considered as a &quot; Bavarian &quot; exempl@@ ary . &quot;
a small fr@@ ame@@ ful drinking water @-@ purpose @-@ association as a model for the large water@@ producer .
so it was in front of some time in the original alt@@ on in a post of the Bavarian Radio .
a little later the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken was a few later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ eit@@ s group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sailed as exempl@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the two @-@ association employee , 28 years as managing director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose group with seat in K@@ ott@@ endorf , Municipality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes about 15@@ 0000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and ham@@ let with about 5500 inhabitants .
affili@@ ates are the churches of Kirch@@ alle , Breit@@ brunn , a loud , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
for further cities and municipalities there are water supply contracts .
the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was stopped in 1985 as a water@@ way and was named as Managing Director of the Pur@@ pos@@ ed Association in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks are very diverse and they extended from the water management and maintenance work over office and organiz@@ ational activities , the budget for the budget , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency principles on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding events , it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new well ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the area of the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the re@@ build of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the majority of water pipes .
I have not given a stand@@ still , and I have always recorded innovations , because water lives , and drinking water is the most important food .
in their Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o , they praised G@@ öl@@ lers , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has worked with a lot of heart blood vessels for his water @-@ purpose and has lived in the water @-@ purpose association , when it would be his own company .
a few weeks ago , he was able to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ s group to the nit@@ rate level to the nit@@ rate of Lower Fran@@ ks in front of a few weeks ago .
he has received very much recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller s@@ anders praised waterfalls Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who had worked together with him for 28 years .
he is the best water and he was a faithful folder .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from his point of view , he designated the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the purpose of the purpose .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use , however , the pipe in the field of the church was on a 3rd of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night , so that the villages are supplied with water .
even the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be kept only because you filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with dro@@ pping .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , who joined Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko goes open to other affected parents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to have the courage to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the competent police in Lübeck initially wanted no information to the T@@ ather@@ walk or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; but confirmed that a man had been killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a T@@ öt@@ t@@ del@@ ik@@ t . &quot;

steel - light sight for German steel industry
the ris@@ ky and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains in a height of additional cost .
financial bur@@ dens , which threatened by the industry from econom@@ ically current funding , are from the table .
it remains at the liberation of Renewable Energi@@ es in the inventory of the so @-@ called self @-@ energy production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fre@@ it@@ ag@@ issue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really happy about that we were able to achieve the negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the European Commission , the European Commission was initially planned to use steel producers , which use gases from the high @-@ furnace power supply to checkout , for checkout .
the steel industry is threatened with additional costs from 120 to 240 million Euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , it is now to give a fundamental certificate with the EU Commission for talks with the Competition Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when generators were replaced in the steel power plants , all an EEG output of 20 percent .
but these will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall in Germany welcomed the unification of Germany with the EU Commission for self @-@ energy production .
the status Quo of the previous regulation will be largely established .
special mean@@ ings have the successful artwork by Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is the future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the first step &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also at the reform of the emission allow@@ ances are climate and employment targets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from the financial crisis in 2008 with over@@ capacities and a significant price pressure .
last year , the situation continued to grow faster than the world &apos;s largest producer in view to the global market in view to the global market .
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel concer@@ to price du@@ mp@@ ing .
in the course of this spring the situation has something relaxed .
for example , shr@@ ink oil on imported steel effect , for the other , the economic prospects in China have been cut off .
un@@ clear how sustainable is the price over@@ h@@ aul is .
the German industry @-@ pri@@ m Thys@@ sen@@ Krupp remained carefully on Thursday .
last prices would have been stag@@ n@@ ated again .

fellowship , spirit , health : sing pra@@ ises to the elderly
Ur@@ sel K@@ ipp already accompanied their whole life : as a young woman she was in the school choir , at the teacher &apos;s teacher , and today she sings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a senior choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing me - emotional and physi@@ cally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she describes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a sample it feels balanced , cheer@@ ful and a total of living , she says .
at the same time , she is doing something good in her health and her spirit .
because S@@ ingen is like from several perspectives a great hob@@ by for seniors , says Erhard Hack@@ ers from the German senior League .
most senior citizens sing in the choir and share the joy of music , describes h@@ ack@@ ler .
through regular merger , seniors can combine and maintain .
for often , social and family structures frequently dissolve , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel K@@ ipp in their choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to organ@@ ise themselves , to leave the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of the compositions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sing can be singing in the positive sense , h@@ ack@@ ler refers .
the senior citizens exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
whoever calls his l@@ ungs regularly calls for everyday life in everyday life as quickly from the pu@@ rest .
even if it comes to get the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hob@@ by .
for older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz says from the federal employment community of the senior citizens .
in the older generations the common S@@ ingen had a much higher job , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , explains it .
L@@ enz often observed that singing or listen to songs during older people many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
lyrics and especially tun@@ es experien@@ cing himself , people ende@@ av@@ ed to mark the events of a long time .
in addition , a special performance is required when singing the head .
at the same time , at the same time , concentrate on their own voice and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cogn@@ itive challenge .
just older people who live alone , do not only focus on himself .
another positive aspect is the recognition , which drives through the singing in the choir , h@@ ack@@ ler believes .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em is also growing by singing in the choir .
themselves to show itself : if I be a little bit for something , I &apos;ll get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start with singing , there is enough .
whoever wants to try a new hob@@ by , should not hesitate , even if he writes , little talent , don &apos;t hesitate .
you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 singing people , who hears , when a tone goes next ?
in search of the suitable offer , seniors have various possibilities , says h@@ ack@@ ler .
he sings someone out of a boy in a veter@@ an ench@@ ant@@ or , one can easily connect .
many cities also offer views over the choirs in the vicinity .
who wants to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ ast@@ ical choir may directly turn to the church or the church pre@@ sidents .
many senior choirs can also be found via the Internet .
if you have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neigh@@ bors could ask help with the Internet access .
he who want to sing , should definitely be connected to a choir , av@@ eng@@ ed h@@ ack@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let the soul sing well , and has something strange - this is valid for every age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cats respond sen@@ si@@ bler than cr@@ ater on the young of the young
Bi@@ ologists have studied in Hannover , which effect the rest of K@@ atz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys has grown on adult animals .
for her surprise , the male did not get cold - but they kept in the difference to the females always .
female cats may recognize the ra@@ iny of K@@ atz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys at Mi@@ th@@ a@@ wing of the little ones .
they react to ten percent faster on Lau@@ te of k@@ itt@@ ens which chose in great trouble as scientists of the medical university and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
cr@@ aters also react to the soap of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always right .
&quot; obviously the acoustic differences between the Mi@@ th@@ rows of less and greatly er@@ ra@@ iny young were either perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is first authorized to be published on this Friday in the &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ u@@ tionary Biology &quot; magazine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ Schre@@ y distingu@@ ishes between their help of their help .
a total of nine adult hang@@ ers and eight kit@@ es were observed from the zo@@ di@@ ers of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a ru@@ ff of little ones who were taken up for three minutes from the saus@@ age box and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
for others , they were con@@ fron@@ ted with scre@@ ams of stronger k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers keep their results despite small sample for meaning@@ ful .
&quot; all the female , even those who had no one &apos;s own offspring , differenti@@ ated to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
it turned out faster to the speakers , if this ru@@ fe has played a very high k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be born or developed with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the male had re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already investigated their reactions from women and men to baby noise .
some studies showed that women responded with sensitive to infants , all of whether they were mothers or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ ica Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .

it was a sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile Sz@@ ener@@ ie : with a broken smile , she was still in the hall with her performance .
when it was established that they won &apos;t take gold , the audience broke out in a jub@@ ilee .
but there are still many other sport@@ s@@ men , who in the Rio Olympics in the Rio Olympics Games there are many other sport@@ s@@ men .
here an overview :
Just@@ in Gat@@ line ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversi@@ al figures in the athlet@@ ics .
he had already closed two times for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his B@@ ann , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion runs even faster than before , he is more than 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds , the number one in the world and is considered the greatest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ month Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit in 2010 after taking the intake of the pain of Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .

Per@@ kovic denied the knowledge and was closed six months .
the four mostly th@@ rows in this year will go to the account of the great gold f@@ lap .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 m season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m was closed in 2010 and were closed for 21 months .
to have been responsible for penis enlargement , mut@@ ated Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 metres of the world &apos;s fastest man .
I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ ion , Belarus ) : hardly any athletes have been recognized as many medals .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after him was diagnosed with test@@ oster@@ one doping .
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to give Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 because ster@@ oid @-@ d@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ title in 2006 for test@@ oster@@ one abuse .
he was also recognized as a bronze medal for the 2008 Olympic Games , based on a ruling by the International Sport Court of Justice CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked in the rank of World Ran@@ kings .
Li@@ u Hong Kong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record and gold f@@ lap was first tested in May , but still in Rio .
when the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world Champion were found evidence for taking a banned dietary supplement by taking Sper@@ re of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) and ran on 13th July .
bomb error in Thailand - Austri@@ ans viol@@ ated - multiple deaths
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ eller , Fre@@ it@@ ag@@ early .
they had suffered chi@@ ves and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left this .
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
whether from the more explo@@ sions on holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ erk@@ on also Austrian citizens are still un@@ clear , is still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs see this in persistent contact with local authorities , so did not break .
at approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in one of two bombs .
according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ changing in killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
afterwards , two jumps ended up again , thereby , according to the authorities a further human being killed .
Ph@@ u@@ ket was also used by Ph@@ u@@ ket in the morning in the morning .
a taxi driver has been viol@@ ated by a taxi driver for the Det@@ onation in one of the most popular swi@@ m@@ ower in Pat@@ ong .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , the south @-@ east coast of the country explo@@ ded another bomb that killed an urban company .
according to the authorities in a cau@@ tion , the Spr@@ eng@@ ul@@ et passed the air in front of the prec@@ inct of coastal police into the air .
finally , Det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ erk@@ on on the south @-@ east coast , several convic@@ tions .
we go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was named .
&quot; the bomb attack bear the same manuscript , &quot; said army members Dan@@ ai crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fre@@ it@@ ag@@ early in front of journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to express itself on possible moti@@ ves - probably do &#91; it &#93; for the deeds of Muslim reb@@ els . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical for the bombing of a mus@@ li@@ ous separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
however , the Thai police declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement , or with the international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local Sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it rather go out that the bombs were laid by the bombs of the ruling military j@@ unta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities have received secret evidence for the coming attacks in the South of the country - but they don &apos;t be informed about the exact date and places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
still be un@@ clear what group is placed behind the attacks .
the police rejected its officials throughout the country , security about important government buildings , as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement district .
in Thailand there are always smaller bomb attacks , but they do not judge for tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Tha@@ il@@ ar king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends the Austrian Foreign Ministry on his homepage to make the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ ar and its surroundings .
according to disputes between security forces and Muslim popul@@ ations , there is not necessary trips in these provinces .
increased safety risk ( safety level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday was a few days after a controversi@@ al referendum on a Constitution of the military j@@ unta .
this dre@@ am@@ ity of the military influence also in the years ago .
Jun@@ ta @-@ b@@ oss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ CH@@ A said that bombs had been a attempt to make chaos within the direction of stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military j@@ unta , which had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , the kingdom holds itself to stability and order .
however , the military has not succeeded in order to get the insur@@ rection of mus@@ li@@ ous reb@@ els since years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 500 people were killed in the conflict .
almost one year ago in Bangkok at a popular Hin@@ du @-@ Sch@@ p@@ urely 20 people were killed , most of them foreign tourists were killed .
it was the bloody beg@@ inner of the country &apos;s younger history .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is in the visor of the Federal Office of Constitutional Protection .
according to several fac@@ tions , the constitutional complaints in the Federation have also provided the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identity Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for taxation against the freedom of democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said constitutional protection Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigrants is diffuse , or from the Middle East in extrem@@ ist way diff@@ am@@ ated .
therefore we observe the movement now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group of group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is turned against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ cul@@ t @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of own identity through overseas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Constitu@@ ent Conference in Nine West countries - Bremen , Bavaria , H@@ esse , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; Identity &quot; .
Ma@@ ate said , his authority ass@@ essing the decision to be closely matched to the decision .
&quot; groups such as the &apos; identity movement &apos; try to pick their target group as it stands , &quot; said the constitutional protection .
in general try extreme slopes , talk with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the Islam@@ ist Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mes .
this is not an old advertising for his own thing .
prop@@ aganda shall be emotional to people .
young people are due as a special manner .
this is dangerous .
in several German states there had been reports about contacts of &quot; Identity &quot; to Af@@ D policies .
Ma@@ ate said , he did not have knowledge .
possible contacts of this type are only relevant for the constitutional protection of this type .
it comes to whether the party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain persons , the extrem@@ ist changes , changes its target device and is therefore extrem@@ ly ist@@ ically .
so , if such persons controls the influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
with a view to the significant increase of legal grounds and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee accommodations , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we noticed in the past few years that there may be legal im@@ perfec@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fre@@ it@@ aler Group .
it can be quite a fact that other mort@@ al groups form or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee , or attacks from other right wing extre@@ mes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a German @-@ wide or European control of rec@@ ster@@ il@@ ism is not recogni@@ z@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the previous groups are based on regional level or social networks .
so , Ma@@ ate , Ma@@ ate about that many more attacks on the account of people went out , who didn &apos;t have occurred in the right scene .
this is the concern .
many of the facts before attacks on asylum seek@@ ers are not known as crime , polit@@ ically motiv@@ ated off@@ ences or p@@ endants of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed off@@ ences committed to the hat previously with right @-@ wing extre@@ mes , who were perhaps polit@@ ically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or Lin@@ ke , who , however , have become radi@@ alised by right @-@ wing extre@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to their information , according to the opposite le@@ aster , partly destroyed , partly on the run@@ way .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped in a tr@@ ench , as a spokesperson for the police Aur@@ i / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the bus number could not be self @-@ driven by bus , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade delivered the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ance and emergency cars came to the accident at Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ last travel were brought back from one line bus to the cr@@ ot@@ ape district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the journey .
the investig@@ ator demanded the load @-@ driver and possible witnesses to sign up in the police .
the fees per cubic meters of wast@@ ew@@ ater is from 1 October 2016 for the area of se@@ wage system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / World Council 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 Euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ denberg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the Az@@ endorf facility , the se@@ wage fee will then increase once again , if corresponding improvement measures will be necessary .
following a relevant calculation , the se@@ wage price will be in Az@@ endorf , at 4,@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was found at the approval of the budget by the land@@ lord of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these san@@ itation systems are running .
the Kas@@ endorf market is oblig@@ ated to operate on the basis of legal basis , facilities cost @-@ related facilities .
from October 1 , 2016 , citizens and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ ch@@ enko , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ denberg , Lin@@ denberg , Lin@@ denberg , Lin@@ denberg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg have to reach the pur@@ se .
the commission income ranges between 48 and 67 percent .
as an administrative manager Herbert Schmidt on the board , there was a new cal@@ am@@ ulation of the fees for the se@@ wage plants of the market in the market .
during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ lay and covers from the previous calendar period are also possible .
with all three se@@ wage plants , Schmidt founded the gra@@ dients of relatively small facilities with a very low se@@ wage accident , which was between 6@@ 800 and 12000 cubic metres per year .
due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would be engraved .
in addition , the se@@ wage must be slightly declined in all three plants .
furthermore , during all three installations are not least due to their age of san@@ itation and repair expenses in a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for cat@@ ar@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ denberg and L@@ opp .
it pointed out that in the se@@ wage system Az@@ endorf had to be replaced the mechanical ventilation system due to damage .
in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ ch@@ enko , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and during the pond water treatment , the Kl@@ är@@ s@@ lu@@ dge has had to be fitted and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to maintain the water requirements in future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to these extraordinary expenses , the service and maintenance costs came to be considered in the new Kal@@ kul@@ ation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which occur at the previous level of lim@@ estone in the years 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made clear that at low se@@ wage fall in the three plants the expenditure for the operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is , complem@@ entary Schmidt , the market leaders of large entertainment costs in the past 20 years has remained .
the situation for the af@@ o@@ rem@@ enti@@ oned facilities will continue to remain pre@@ fecture , especially since one could not expand the supply of the se@@ wage Association Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al in order to expand these plants because it is about de@@ struc@@ tive facilities .

snap@@ shots &quot; An@@ ime &quot; Effect as Asian cartoon
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is An@@ ime @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is un@@ sensitive to breeds .
with its filter tool , it allows snap@@ shots about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with ident@@ ities in such a way that borders the ab@@ sur@@ d .
you can walk in a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings .
the filters are un@@ bl@@ oss@@ om , autonomous tools that generate more than 30 million more sel@@ ector per day .
all failure to the public .
in the past criticism in the past , the app that the app Black@@ face transported or white skin was prop@@ ag@@ ated as beauty ideal .
when this week had a filter that struck a filter , which gave them s@@ itz@@ ky , false teeth , and drawn up , they called some critics a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ out . &quot;
they asked if this repet@@ itive contro@@ vers@@ y came to a larger problem that the company has with di@@ ver@@ ity .
the News and the Emp@@ ty were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat , that it would have disabled the feature .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was thought as an homage to An@@ ime characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but external events that R@@ ass@@ is@@ sm@@ us have experienced , rec@@ alled the filter to viol@@ ate clari@@ fication .
others refused the An@@ ime comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean American art student , whose T@@ we@@ et was widespread over the photos that the filter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; viol@@ ate and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was un@@ pleasant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to discuss with the counter@@ part of a very contra@@ dic@@ tive Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not sigh@@ ted , but that the yel@@ low@@ out was pulled down in the extreme extre@@ mes .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that this cultural Stol@@ am@@ per@@ ate crosses .
the American culture seems to be involved in a endless di@@ ver@@ ance and integration process , from conference spaces up to Hollywood and the equipment that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large au@@ dien@@ ces of young people - who are in terms of race , more than their older opponents - could be expected more likely to expect sen@@ si@@ vity .
if one of snap@@ ch@@ ats filters a picture is that it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year old K@@ atie Zh@@ u said in an interview on Thursday .
in Thursday , Zh@@ u decided to work as a product manager and engineering in medium for medium their Snap@@ chat account to er@@ ase others to do the same thing .
in an ess@@ ay for medium and in a telephone interview she said that they believe that racial , ins@@ ul@@ um intensi@@ fication a lack of di@@ spar@@ ity in the introductory practices of snap@@ shots .
Zh@@ u crit@@ ically critic@@ ized the great part of white , only male leadership and finished their ess@@ ay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors , so that they may meet such decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chin@@ i @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors , who work there , but not in positions to tell what they say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat is mostly un@@ answered .
the company publishes no numbers on the di@@ vest@@ ment of its staff and indicates the status as a private company .
on Thursday , it refused to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his employees , but according to a speaker , the company has recently recru@@ ited a staff responsible that focuses on under@@ taking population groups and internal integration efforts .
Zh@@ u said in its part , that she will be able to leave their Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more user as we need to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military Represent@@ ative IS@@ IS Secret service information , presents Committee of the Congress
the United States Central Command was changed in order to record an optim@@ istic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as the actual states of the meeting in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Armed Forces , Secret Services and the Wehr@@ bud@@ get@@ ic , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction at Central Command Intelligence Service , reported that they changed their inv@@ alu@@ ation to the U.S. efforts to fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; News Service Information , which were typically sent out of high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Kom@@ man@@ de@@ er , recorded regularly a positive image from the American efforts to terrorism as it allows the actual states on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is done at Cent@@ Com , is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses were presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership errors in Cent@@ Com goes up to the top of the organisation .
the tenth report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the formation of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct references to change that government peaks under Obama has given to change reports , how anal@@ ysts saw the pressure of its pre @-@ legal appearance , an optim@@ istic image from the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or I@@ si@@ l .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 many central Command press releases , comments and statements in front of the Congress was clearly positive than the facts &quot; presented .
for example , Cent@@ Com members announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second largest city of Iraq remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , it is much clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of Kansas , in a opinion .
from the middle of 2014 until the middle of 2015 , the tips of Central Command changed the subsequent reports to play the risk by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force , after giving them up , anal@@ ysts had been wor@@ ried about the manip@@ ulation of reports to Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights during the investigations .
further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are included in the Secretary @-@ inspec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defense in the G@@ ange .
the Democratic Party of the News of Intelligence published their own knowledge , with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com introduced a revised process for the preparation of subsequent inv@@ alu@@ ations on I@@ si@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highest number of Democrats in the compass , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff took place in a position . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. ship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of subsequent service reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mor@@ ally filed under anal@@ ysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was relatively little space for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and Democrats they gave no information on an intervention of the White House in Cent@@ Com anal@@ ysts regarding a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specific political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; .
last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s investig@@ ational inspec@@ tions , which were admitted to complaints by Cent@@ Com anal@@ ysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press brie@@ cher of the Pentagon , gave a statement that the Ministry of Defense had no reports of the Congress , while the investigation of the General Spec@@ t@@ act is still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also answered that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes are quite di@@ verg@@ ent regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversi@@ al discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investigation on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that has now been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the alleg@@ ations of the past year however , however , President Obama failed to leave the Central Command for hon@@ est assessment of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the cr@@ iti@@ que was remin@@ ded over the Islamic State of more than ten years ago as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a font by George W. Bush against the recommendations of many anal@@ ysts just looking at a little time on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thought about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team will establish Mr. Hoo@@ ker after speci@@ fying government agencies that would have no significant effects on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these pro@@ vision@@ ing oil refin@@ eries were used to sell oil on the Black@@ market .
however , this realization was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ized by members of the sentence due to its revised positive assessment of war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the U.S. gain fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , show@@ down show@@ down with Britain before
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that Americans won the American with 3 @-@ 0 .
five doors in two games should actually mean a memor@@ able performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , she could not remember that ever done ever .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people that keep their gates in memory .
however , this knows it : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition , and are equally suited to the British in their first place finish in Japan with 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
both teams have already been qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which the two will get their first place within their group of six teams .
the first fin@@ ishers will go out a bit longer from the path that lead the other group .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising ver@@ te@@ bel , four years after the last London Games in the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania on , and had the first time a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ ra@@ cket in hands ( their two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years old , she became the most recent in the history of the team .
you missed the Olympic Games in 2008 , as they could not qualify for the buyer .
then the year 2012 , where she and her team went away everything .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the National Team and thus began to turn out the things for better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , a mental change and physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work of work in London , which we now have .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can pull down the ru@@ d@@ der completely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened up the cake in the first half of the game with a back@@ drop of the se@@ am .
India was going into the game without victory in the game , but the team showed a sur@@ prisingly fenced and held the player from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am the game took into their hands .
it led a spr@@ int with the flat ball about the left fl@@ ank , then moved to the middle and lu@@ p@@ ens the ball in the gate around the US a 2 @-@ 0 guidance .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a fool in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
as well as B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on Saturday the result of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the Olympic Games , the Zen of Tramp@@ ol@@ ins
wherever you are too , as late as too , the Olympic Games are too late .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are durable and un@@ defiled , a sh@@ aving relay between competition and stre@@ ches .
it is known as the Olympic tor@@ ch itself was a burning rod , who protect the bracel@@ ets for the time of the Turner at the time of tri@@ athletes .
you can not switch to the TV , a newspaper read or listen to the talk about your neigh@@ bors in the qu@@ eu@@ e , without having Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ covers , or the battle between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there are Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women with round dimples , could definitely be sent to Prime Time , constructed by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertis@@ ements if he was a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even F@@ ender .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , Lake Forest , California , fighting for the olymp@@ ic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports , which are not univers@@ ally recognised : aerial pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the chest swimming and may have it long .
but if I have modest arguments for my particular lovers , then let me leave the attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the tr@@ amp .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ ip has been a Olympic event since 2000 , when it had been in Sydney , the last 16 years so many that I had asked , did not know that there is a Olympic port .
this could also be regional Ig@@ nor@@ ms .
although the USA athletes won for the competition , it has never won a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ ines and had a athletes until 2012 , who made it until the end of the end of 2012 .
the Chinese and the Rus@@ sians tend to divide the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans to share the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year .
the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ ip has a certain outdoor use , partly because it sounds for the un@@ loaded ear to a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should ad@@ mit that I am not an expert but only a little enthusiasm .
it has hum@@ or@@ ist@@ ical potential - the Cart@@ o@@ on@@ ous cit@@ ations of his never s@@ wollen s@@ wimm@@ ers - but also the gra@@ zie of gy@@ ms and diving , which combines two sports species , which essentially combines it essentially .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spr@@ ung@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up@@ stream sk@@ ip on a gig@@ antic trampoline , shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and must have a number of falling movements ( turning , hal@@ e and sal@@ tos ) before they l@@ ending at the feet .
you will be judged according to the official Olympi@@ ap@@ ro@@ gram after execution , difficulty and &quot; time &quot; time . &quot;
two young athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic V@@ ektor is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts in their stre@@ ches after gold further , faster , upward and upward , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes up and back , back to the playground and down on the playground .
you will not only hunt the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the starting wall , but in the television transmission : the world or the Olympic team .
the goal is Nobel , ad@@ mir@@ able , even fan@@ atic , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to stir even a viewer .
but it &apos;s also what I would like to watch over this games as a bit more tired .
it offers the trampoline a re@@ boot time .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines is above .
a back@@ ward movement is not the target .
he or pr@@ un@@ t , seem@@ ingly he@@ avi@@ est , like a ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes to the top , then after the bottom , then effort@@ lessly back to the top .
there is also a contest , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the destination , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ aming , elegant repe@@ ats of time and gravity .
it is that Zen can only be Zen in the Olympic Games .
the qualification and final round of women will be held on Friday afternoon , in streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday also around 13.00 .
N@@ BC will shine as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
in the middle of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie they speak a quiet , nice moment , one who will probably see in general tum@@ ult .
when the sens@@ ation of consciousness can only be reached by the Ang@@ ers and the object of male athletes - like the male US Turner , according to The Wall Street Journal , then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his to air ring , new fan base .
&quot; a generation protest@@ ed &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an alliance of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators that demand political changes in Ethiopia , shooting a violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that his Protest@@ ants were killed during inter@@ rog@@ ations with police in shot .
is Ethiopia right now ?
in the past ten years , it was one of the most stable African countries , a solid association with a fast @-@ growing economy .
but in the last months , protests against the government the country and far more areas were gathered .
last week released thousands of people on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was un@@ merciful to human rights organizations .
witnesses testified that polic@@ emen were shot and killed and killed .
in circulation , during the last or beginning of this year , the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , will show young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand against a wall .
the Chief of the UN High Authority for Human Rights now demands a preliminary investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to keep this country and will be even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ated country of Africa and its stability is estimated at the west .
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror against the region , in particular in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , get a lot of Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy grew in considerable pace .
its infrastructure has been dra@@ stically improved - there is a new press release in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was more than a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued to continue through the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , but dis@@ sidents were effective to silence .
many were sent into exile or in prison , or put into the desert in the wilderness .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you press people and don &apos;t have any other options except protest@@ ing , it breaks out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protest@@ ed .
a generation protest@@ ed .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the floor up to the lit@@ eral handle in relation to power of the rule of the rule .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a widespread election of the last year , the gover@@ ning party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and control 100 per cent of the parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , the tension along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a fight for this z@@ ag , controversi@@ al line called for hundreds of lives .
anal@@ ysts agree that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been en@@ forced more or less , the tur@@ bul@@ ences could rise , and could be armed again .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ ing after years of age is now explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems to be harm@@ less : smart phones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper phones were increasingly more common and improved the Internet services .
even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially at protests , many people can still communicate over the Internet Pro@@ x@@ ies that hide , where they may stop it .
several young Ethiopia gave it to protests , that they were gathered to protests .
the second factor is that it is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since 1991 , Am@@ har@@ as has been pro@@ sper@@ sed the Am@@ har@@ as , mainly Christian high countries , in politics and economy , while they carried out the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and living in a flat land areas .
but this is changing right now .
&quot; we are here to coordinate with a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the largest protests were held in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos did the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which account for about 6 percent of the population , and the military , in the intelligence , trade and politics .
the third reason for un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Mel@@ es , a former rebellion until his death was an un@@ sealed disease in 2012 for 17 years in Ethiopia &apos;s Prime Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was considered a tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man that could think of the corners .
anal@@ ysts say that it was especially licensed to use early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special arrangements to edit the opponent and make them harm@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is missing on this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di said a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n was chosen out of relatively un@@ clear reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike the Lord Mel@@ es , who came out of the Tig@@ ray region of Nord@@ Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analy@@ st say that it does not enjoy the confidence of the security services by the Tig@@ ray controlled safety services .
many fears that the result will be more bloo@@ d@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an u@@ pro@@ ar since 2005 , after thousands of elections were protest@@ ed by the government and then stolen by the government .
during the following ra@@ ids , many protest@@ ers were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and the time of un@@ rest went relatively fast .
development experts from Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their visionary infra@@ structures , as well as new comm@@ uter train , as well as for its meas@@ ur@@ able progress in the poverty control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but obviously this did not prevent the intensive mis@@ conduct of the Ethiop@@ ian government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
the last month , protest@@ ers in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ bo@@ lic city , by Tig@@ ray , business , and hat@@ red against the Tig@@ ray is always usual in the social media .
analy@@ st say that protests in the USA and other Western allies are able to bring into a separate position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights about the neighboring Somalia , even if they had recently closed that this base has closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the West wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want that his ban collap@@ sed in an already vol@@ at@@ ile area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin dress &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declares his claim that Obama had been founded &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ mus &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump attempted to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday the last contro@@ vers@@ y , by taking his campaign , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton , who would not have been seriously .
this clari@@ fication was designed to communicate new questions concerning communication capabilities of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans whether he is able to communicate clear and under@@ stand@@ able to communicate with the American public .
it also brings his Mit@@ er to take him during an event@@ ful phase to protect , in the actual position that he could not have .
after gradu@@ ating on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump had made a memor@@ andum on Wednesday evening , ru@@ ined Mr. Tr@@ ump in relation to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and continu@@ ance in interviews that he really did not plan to say , the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early mor@@ ale T@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply sar@@ cast@@ ic .
the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day , to which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews that said the debt .
as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump , wanted to destroy the statement , saying that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him that Mr. Obama wanted nothing to destroy the republi@@ can presidential candidate .
the last storm of criticism of Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to med@@ itate the focus of his campaign on economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held spe@@ eches on the economic situation in Michigan , this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return again this topic .
on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would lead to higher taxes and that he had bor@@ ing their address .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought Sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of July , he moved to himself when he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he later explained &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Of course I said the sar@@ cast@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the lingu@@ istic limits in politics and then return to ru@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages from his fans are taken to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to what the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , who observed the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think it is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in different way .
instead of the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has been an un@@ riv@@ alled sound , since its surveys have gone back again .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , who was released on Friday , showed a lead in the Federal States of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and a head @-@ on @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump in general is trying to exc@@ use himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he charged his critics often to understand his statements or in@@ corrup@@ ted his hum@@ or .
but while he has strengthened the attention of attention in the past few months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps S@@ hib@@ its his lo@@ y@@ alen Mit@@ disper@@ sion have to be brought to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ant would be like pro@@ voc@@ ant .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ umps &apos;s most popular inter@@ c@@ ers , gave himself great effort to defend the candidates in a CNN interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani therefore said to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ umps &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense , that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he named it back@@ bit@@ es , completely false and so that it happened , because he moved the troops from Iraq .
most ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to arg@@ um@@ ate that the government served under Obama when Mrs. Clinton served as an Foreign Minister , it rep@@ ented the situation in the Middle East , under control .
before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media , and cast them off before , on each of his words and to be connected to each of his words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It cannot be ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats sp@@ y on Mr. Tr@@ umps In@@ struction as just a further evidence that it is un@@ suitable for the Presidential Office .
once upon the price of the market , café in Green@@ point is coming back
using the verb Cafe was a single café in William@@ sburg , where one could pay only cash , that &apos;s not a Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years of good coffee .
of course the prices came from its Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ Front .
the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , replaced in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of Cup@@ cakes .
native popul@@ ated as last loss in a gent@@ leman city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ z wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still cannot believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap store . &quot;
but if New York change is , then it is also new .
a restored ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted Credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old caf@@ és , the owner and managing director of the new caf@@ és .
he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 , and remained there until the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a customer offered to provide money for a new office , he was excited to do it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept much .
using the verb , the same distributor for the Bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ som@@ ic machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he would also want to experiment .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu offers sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are yar@@ n like cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é onions .
there is natural seeds .
the café serves no beer more , because there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he noticed an old current of old people .
&quot; many old customers have also been pushed out by prizes from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg , and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after they had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way off .
after that Ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coff@@ e@@ dic@@ ine , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was clear that it was on the coffee and at the age of culture , which was right in me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drinks again coffee , even if it served on this day instead of its usual I@@ ced coffee , one bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and ordered in@@ sof@@ ar as the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day as a Swiss watch watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order but sometimes , he turns his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he has no gro@@ ll , that the soap store has taken the old business area .
in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Ch@@ erie is to produce a special soap for sale with cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee of caf@@ és .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated into a new customer and Rodri@@ guez said that he has shown to see her new neigh@@ bors , so that his new neigh@@ bors were welcome .
the site also has further advantages .
a local juice to fill the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee to bottles and sell it .
there is a chance that the Café expanded to an adjacent building .
for many customers , a new ra@@ b is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was pe@@ er and said that he was destroyed by the ground when the café lock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the new café opened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said that the loc@@ alization of the loc@@ als and the best coffee is felt like a return home . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt his lunch took part in the O@@ val Office .
as Fein@@ schm@@ ecker , President Roosevelt a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acy on Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland Wasser@@ sch@@ ild@@ a soup .
his menu on this day was slightly modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato p@@ ure@@ e , and as dessert a p@@ ud@@ ding p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the staff , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans that should eat . &quot;
a couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histor@@ ian .
&quot; &quot; &quot; co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CH@@ OP Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was told by Chinese cuisine in the United States while bricks in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their newest cooperation , &quot; A permanent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a repor@@ ter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ au@@ ell@@ os@@ em I@@ mb@@ h in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has existed since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh water @-@ sandwich with olive gro@@ oves , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn ate with potato p@@ ure@@ e and vegetable .
when the repor@@ ter was min@@ ed , this pair found the pair for discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food were very popular &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were made out of a Zut@@ phen and a somewhat cheaper , that stretches out the access .
imagine , so many pe@@ an@@ uts have to eat that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E grin@@ d .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be like lead in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in a American household , mainly in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women co@@ iled for male field@@ workers and it was served fresh past@@ ed past@@ ries for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans that sent to Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the way to which the land moved with it , no more the sn@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time , in the food for the Americans , a central , ang@@ esp@@ an theme was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; called Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new Bud@@ get@@ s@@ own was the new Bud@@ get@@ ic : mysterious food such as bread and c@@ asser@@ ole have been recovered as a &quot; wonderful Art , Ess@@ ential remains of &quot; wonderful kind to hide the appet@@ ite ingredients under a creative sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper d@@ rought .
meat , the years of age of the American kitchen , was an extremely rare luxury .
in@@ trin@@ sic mixtures were tried , as a cal@@ orie @-@ cal@@ ori@@ ous and nutr@@ itious satisfaction before taste or even healthy kitchen rose .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , a dish from this ep@@ och , ch@@ ack@@ ed onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; there was no popular addition to the lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions fit not to each other .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeping recipes .
as never before or since then , the household of household income - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating hab@@ its of the country .
by using recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; budget donation &quot; and the challenge , p@@ amp@@ e such as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with carr@@ ots in delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical d@@ ain@@ ties .
especially tasty are the reports about the answer of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ die L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ eating @-@ attitude .
while he publicly fi@@ eth the simple I@@ owa farms in its kitchen , sp@@ ei@@ ste it is as the million@@ th man of the world , which he has become .
&quot; he mo@@ red continental cuisine as fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost gold plated dining room and contributed to a Smoking .
he was wonderful real@@ time .
President Roosevelt might have committed the same mist@@ akes if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to equ@@ ip him with his stomach .
as described in the book , the An@@ onym of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flav@@ ours by Ms. Roosevelt , that the White House initiated the bor@@ ing food in Washington , but also one of the most difficult food . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , with food can be rejected , once the country returned to the legs .
the legacy lies on our ongoing focus on calories and food , she said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as science on food .
the pair was given to the letter of the book to understand the eating hab@@ its of Zi@@ egel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law - for example how food could not throw away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; they really got sick . &quot;
there was the pas@@ ch case .
after the plates were vac@@ ated at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they stri@@ pped and Co@@ e a Des@@ sert which she had prepared at home : the Pfl@@ au@@ ra , ate the President Roosevelt at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said Zi@@ egel@@ man , and added that there was a common tri@@ ck , modest recipes to miss a nice name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no added cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone can resist a spoon in the teeth , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
nothing tast@@ ed it wasn &apos;t bad .
CO@@ E won a r@@ ash three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ get@@ ic he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bombs : he was the hero of Ale@@ pp@@ o
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ pp@@ o : Khal@@ ed Omar , his life in Syria .
he ris@@ ky everything to save their lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died in an end @-@ bom@@ bed attack of the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of &quot; White Hel@@ mets , &quot; a Civil Protection , which has been saved by almost 60,000 people in accordance with the image paper .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ unte@@ ers put their own life on the game to move people from crushed houses and aff@@ ord the first aid in the war .
they are the her@@ oes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of Civil@@ ization that shows him with an 11 @-@ hour saving of a house in 2014 , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrian symbolic figure in the grave of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as her@@ oes , he never seen himself , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me is the genuine Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die , live life , I think that God sees me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar himself fell victim to a victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bombing attacks in Syria .
the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter have cast four façade bombs above the Alz@@ adia District , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;ll be able to remove the remains of the bomb , so that no children will play this &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the image quotes his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime should meet terror@@ ists .
Greenland : the oldest te@@ br@@ oth is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland we usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after a study on board ship S@@ anna to the sea .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and floating with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland &apos;s Greenland got up to 150 years .
in the Greenland about the north @-@ Atlantic crossing , in an hour he is just 1.@@ 220 metres far .
only when it comes up , the five @-@ metre long animal accelerates to a wh@@ opping 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
this long@@ itude of lon@@ el@@ iness seems to be a sponsor@@ ship for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reports in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any time from a Greenland , the 392 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ ell@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic Research in Rostock this lif@@ esp@@ an , which means for ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates a world record .
indeed , the ev@@ olu@@ tionary biolog@@ ist suspected that Greenland will be stone .
only missing the evidence .
Greenland ha@@ ves are difficult to observe , finally , they live mainly in the ice sea before the thin @-@ popul@@ ated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer to water temperatures around 6 degrees Celsius , they usually dive on the surface only in winter .
to know about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s lifestyle .
their tim@@ es@@ core li@@ mb@@ s li@@ mb@@ s they , when they presented six animals before S@@ val@@ bard for six animals .
spoil this shar@@ k : in the stomach of a zo@@ id , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had swal@@ lowed the pine bones of a young ic@@ b@@ ären .
may you may ch@@ ase them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the basis of the ice sea and seek Kad@@ aver , which tor@@ ates from higher water layers according to the bottom .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues were now investigated 28 Greenland , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long while the biggest 502 centi@@ metres size .
to determine the age of the animals , they analy@@ ze the lens core of the shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is already before the birth of the shar@@ ks which the proteins contained therein will not be renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
therefore , its birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , as a nuclear tests on major amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere .
at 220 centimeters of the length of the third smallest animal , the lens core of carbon @-@ 14 contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 , which is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012 .
all larger Greenland ha@@ ves in their lens core to normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts , which occurs by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 o &apos;clock for a 4@@ 93 centimeters long Greenland shar@@ k , at the age of 335 , while the record shar@@ k is even 392 years old .
the Greenland @-@ females just got up again , when they are longer than four metres , was known .
now the researchers could be assigned to the length .
since one of the animals with 392 centimeters , probably on the threshold of the sexually mature and its age with 156 years has been determined , Greenland with a majority of at least one and a half centuries .
this is likely to be the world record for ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ ories live mainly in icy waters , is no co@@ incidence .
also the old record holder , a 211 years old Greenland , whose sp@@ eck is on neck a 120 year old resin tip , was captured before Alaska .
due to its low temperatures , the organis@@ m of the living @-@ living animals often runs on savings .
so you realize later - and al@@ der slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals often are often large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , by which the animal heat does .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of eleph@@ ant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal is so dangerous , and should focus on it as early as possible as many generations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolution of the evolution of the evolution . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Frankfurt profits from Bre@@ x@@ it
according to the City of Main , the City of Paris is the best chances of making jobs and companies established in London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt am most benef@@ iting from Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ countries , Head of the Competence Centre and Real Estate markets of the I@@ W .
according to the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is illegal to operate whether ATM can continue from financial transactions throughout the EU .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called EU @-@ Pass you have to date approval in Britain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is just major US banks .
several banks have already announced , to store jobs .
the Lob@@ by@@ club &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; calcul@@ ates 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks of the euro zone , as well as further important authorities as the European insurance view E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but this would be less significant for the financial sector less than the EC@@ B .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close to the bank &apos;s bank is important for banks , since they can communicate directly with the supervision &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxemburg be@@ eing a great fund sector , but also cut out bad as Dublin with the infrastructure .
Frankfurt am very easy to reach thanks to the great airport .
further points the city with slightly available commercial property .
&quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ countries .
in addition to the Seine , the rental for first @-@ class commercial real estate were 50 percent higher than in the Main Event .

in a ranking of the consulting firm Mer@@ cer stand up the city in place seven , Luxembourg on No.@@ 19 , Dublin at No.@@ 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if the quality of life is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could put further banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fol@@ ds the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it vote , the most important financial centre in Europe will remain the most important financial centre in Europe .

Jewish director sm@@ ashes Berliner Hotel , because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; Res@@ or@@ ation &quot; - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ sealed a media stand , after he had betrayed the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , there was no Israeli pre@@ fix as a staff to a staff . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shoah &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin , signed a open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the country @-@ list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel rooms .
how did it happen in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel via an own call center .
after a statement , the director turned to the hotel &apos;s recipe .
the answer , which he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel told that the measure has a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason that stood behind , dissolved in the director even more .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arab and they asked that the pre @-@ selection is deleted , &quot; the employees of Lanz@@ mann is cited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ ak@@ ov called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were di@@ min@@ ated and dis@@ ma@@ yed out of this event .
that is really very disappointed .
the fact that this has been added in Germany in exactly the hotel chain , even greater dis@@ grace .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ministers said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident dissolved a rather big reson@@ ance in the internet , where people called a sc@@ andal .
some of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel supp@@ ose that it had been given to the alleged collection of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I called it in another contribution , in which it was noted that the hotel is located at the no@@ isy Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , located close to a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly appe@@ aled all the alleg@@ ations of itself , and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ appearing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct instruction , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel does not want to record the screening list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a speaker of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code is now added .

trade between Russia and Iran rise suddenly on 71 % - RT business
according to the sanctions imposed by the sanctions against Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade exchange rate between Moscow and Teheran at the year &apos;s annual comparison was 7@@ 0.9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted up , the interest in Russian company grew strongly to shops in the country , distributed as ambassador .
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to make access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trading volume is between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 , and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade show was achieved by deliveries of machinery , land @-@ vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes for this year from a record number of Irish tourists in Russia .
last year the Russian Federation represented approximately 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily by Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , on Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries that affects the economy in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you could say that the record numbers of Irish tourists will be broken in Russia from the last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Rus@@ sians can visit Iran , some of whom the ambassador hopes to change that it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received monuments in the ancient Persian civ@@ ilization in a good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Sh@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms home when Br@@ ite Gold for cycling service
Scotland Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the Män@@ ner@@ rom Sprint at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio , when the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took part of the An@@ chor@@ us who had made his fellow coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y . he made the legend proud when he was moving home to home a victory of Favor@@ ites New Zealand .
four years ago England claimed a sho@@ cking win while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympi@@ ag@@ ol@@ d@@ med@@ ail@@ len .
they repeated the tri@@ ck , after they take place in March at the railway world championships in London despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys , just a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the substitute for Jamie Staff .
they did this time as an execution .
Ho@@ ys retirement brings a gap to close the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man when they stayed , when they saw the potential in the vill@@ i , which now un@@ folded .
in front of four years ago , Kenn@@ y won a Olympic team in front of four years , but in the Quali@@ fication Round , the New Zealand won the New Zealand in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his round , shortly after his round , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner .
a strategic change made a major part of the transformation from the execution in a higher gear , to slow it down to slow and to keep the temp@@ t and especially sc@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC expert , and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ ds , when they rose to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a tasty comparison &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make it a name .
we have set up a Olympi@@ ad record and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win .
after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , he gave to a weak start to the track .
he returned this statement later and there was no appeal of English rival .
with such an outstanding victory there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels complete with all the GB flags on the triumph@@ al of London &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have joined together as a team in the last three months .
we are so bad with so many world tit@@ els so bad that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation that were won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if the barometer of our progress has been in the last five months , we expect a successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ ys , it is possible in the field of possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
that would be exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( a seem@@ ingly holy date for British sports ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and silver medal .
this is equal to the Ho@@ y of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is participating in the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Team Event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something to win alone to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two other gold medals , he should be smitten with the kn@@ ight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ on competition of the day , but there was further good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ cel@@ W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed Cl@@ ancy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll Quali@@ fied with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 659 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , with a focus on safety in the W@@ ig@@ gins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was yesterday with evidence on the qualification before the qualification as they called him to measure his height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the corresponding Women Competition , the tomorrow continued and ended , av@@ anc@@ ered Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world record time in 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
the GB Team leaves its strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a ch@@ ar to med@@ alli@@ on .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations were driven for Rio .
it played dram@@ atically in the background , as the re@@ sign@@ ation of the technical Leit@@ ers Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the middle of Sex@@ es and Mo@@ b@@ b@@ ing@@ es as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ leton .
however , if one sees the first night of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks very then , as the legendary GB@@ S , which has reached its cli@@ max .
the future of melting from Portland due to repe@@ aling the energy demand
the future of aluminium shells from Portland , Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers , standing on the game , since the plant operators are announced the energy supply agreement , and to raise all delivery contracts , such as the supplying energy company .
this step followed by the Government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to operate the plant .
a payout for 20 years has been running in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the system of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland , stand on the game .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be endangered by a closure .
in addition , it could come to domin@@ o@@ effects , since the melting point consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vic@@ tor@@ ias .
in 2014 , AL@@ CO@@ A closed the Point Henry melting , which led last year to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea force .
the melting of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland loses money and ris@@ ked up a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulations regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the current price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which delivered the big aluminium melting with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , told it that three further owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is located in the majority of a joint venture of AL@@ CO@@ A and Al@@ um@@ ina , the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant is still operated in Portland , what a further physical demand for electricity by the melting means , &quot; divided the company .
AG@@ L also said that the contracts called &quot; backup shops , &quot; which should be in force from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period , so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the income , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current supplier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on income on AG@@ L from G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong termin@@ ology for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L announced that it has already written the value of the tre@@ aties at its annual financial statements of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to make tre@@ aties , the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melting , or the power to the melting , do not imp@@ aired . &quot;
the US company said that it has completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang which should have been completed by November this year , even if there is still a declaration , why it has been withdrawn from the contract .
due to the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closing of the Portland melting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements of the anal@@ ysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland use approximately 900 mega@@ watts of electricity per year .
if both facilities disappear from the market , this would mean significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as generating sets , it would not be good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a touch of reality TV @-@ Star , Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of the V@@ ogue
Antonio Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ er and mother of Kar@@ b@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner Cl@@ ans is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US V@@ ogue .
Kendall , the ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der is and at the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; in a room full of people that I love , brought me the sight of this Co@@ vers to the wines , &quot; wrote Kendall .
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizar@@ re ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Car@@ b@@ hi@@ es and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as well as the cover of her sister and ends with a classical track : they are all planned for a surprise partner .
this depic@@ ts the sound @-@ cre@@ dible hand @-@ held action almost every birthday parties ( Se@@ ac@@ ea brought the proposition , &quot; You have forgotten you ? , &quot; with hon@@ esty of a cartoon animation at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to be able to participate in this pub@@ s .
with regard to the September edition of the V@@ ogue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ her@@ ans started .
Kend@@ alls great sister Kim mag , what the V@@ ogue cover goes to see ( she and her husband Kan@@ ye West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition is a league for themselves .
the September edition is the most important issue of the year for V@@ ogue .
with a circum@@ ference , rather resem@@ bles a picture tape as a fashion magazine , the edition has a large number of Wer@@ hi@@ on@@ ista on the 8@@ 32 pages of the rolling body 615 pp .
the revel@@ ations of its Co@@ ver@@ stars is expected to see that in the last two years , pictures of the magazine still produced before official announcement .
women who were already in the cover , Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ r@@ ities , the modeling &quot; as &quot; models that are celeb@@ r@@ ities are &quot; on the cover .
in 2013 , Oscar lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 at the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even at low probability that Mrs. Jen@@ ner is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; break@@ able model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of its generation - below the previous category is located in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ r@@ ities are not related to fam@@ ines or reality Stars or teenagers from today to know how to turn into a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is upon Jen@@ ner ) .
they are truly talented women who are in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once appeared in the last cover , with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers does not recommend it to everyone .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos; position was always sc@@ anned in the fashion world .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called them &quot; the mist@@ akes of the eyel@@ ids . &quot;
these feelings came up again , when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the V@@ ogue Cover .
but on the mis@@ si@@ p that seems to pass on the point .
Kendall Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the V@@ ogue .
it is in the tru@@ sts of the Word a super model .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your base of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters sell your pictures from their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells pictures from Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the LO@@ VE magazine .
and in their leisure time , she is in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
study sites prove 16@@ 0,000 people per year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s necess@@ ities must be rejected by the common areas centres annually , while the industry reli@@ es on the effects of further aver@@ ages on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for od@@ or@@ ating delic@@ acy and similar ones - have been looking for free legal advice and legal dispute .
legal services in the municipality , which are already over@@ l@@ ent , are ready for further cuts .
as of June the next year it is intended to lose a further 30 percent of their federal rights .
the director of the Municipal Cent@@ res of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Clinic revealed that thousands of people have been rejected each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation without a repe@@ al of the Federal Government would only be worse .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land Community centres are chron@@ ically financed , which means thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ imag@@ in@@ able and inv@@ iting debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have un@@ just@@ ly released problems - all these people have problems just@@ i@@ fiable kind and this collection , that they cannot receive the help you need .
the federal government will be aver@@ aged by 30 percent as of June 2017 , which means thousands of help need to be forced out of Que@@ ens@@ land , with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for the Secretary @-@ General and Federal Minister of Justice , as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to raise these Middle distances , so that people may require to receive legal problems with legal issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal agents on the national average .
it is now at the time to see the needs of the Municipal Cent@@ res and their client communities , as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k is investing in this important work .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey on Länder @-@ elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the Federal States of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) a considerable losses for the SPD SPD and the CD@@ U are character@@ ised .
the representative surveys of opinion research institutes IN@@ SA for the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rule over the north , this is not possible after the surveys in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD would have the strongest party , and would have good opportunities to set the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD pl@@ ung@@ es by 3@@ 5.6 percent in five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey only , the party will only be just under the CD@@ U , which could rise to 23 per cent .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
on 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country .
despite slight losses , in spite of slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.7 percent ) again in the country &apos;s country .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP are not represented by 3 percent each in the country .
according to the member of the Chamber of Dep@@ uties , the SPD in the survey was only 23 percent ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
this is still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ uties .
with 5 percent , F@@ DP could hope to return , the pir@@ ates would miss it contrary to 2011 in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator : the first smartphone
E @-@ Mail and Internet in Temp@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Commun@@ ic@@ ator arrived on the market .
the success@@ ors dominated the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was thick@@ ener and larger , it was therefore not good in your hand .
on the contrary , it was quite kno@@ ck .
the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning eight Meg@@ abytes , which would suff@@ ice today for approximately two sel@@ ector with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ abyte .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator &quot; was exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the business and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros , fans can still buy the devices in the internet , but they come som@@ eh@@ ow from the Stone Age of the Internet Age .
20 years ago , the Commun@@ ic@@ ator was a sens@@ ation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer Fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; office in the western bottle format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was able to receive a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails were sent and received , also by fax was the Commun@@ ic@@ ator .
even the access to websites was possible via HTML browsers , even if qu@@ int@@ ently slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and a electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone couldn &apos;t be opened as a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen took place .
quite proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , which is about 1400 Euro .
the average selling price of smartphones in Germany was Euro 392 in 2015 .
no one could have been in August 1996 that the Commun@@ ic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the clu@@ sion phones are a success story , if not for Nokia .
the mobile phone card of the Finn@@ s experienced an exceptional disaster , was finally sold on Microsoft and handled by Microsoft .
today , the market rule today , all of them were much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , this is today for very many people daily .
in 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold , approximately 1.4 billion devices were sold on Samsung and Apple , including 555 million units alone .
worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
the well @-@ running business of the countless app suppliers and the t@@ elecommunication concert are coming .
around the smartphone is meanwhile a whole industry developed .
the decisive breakthrough came to the mass market at the beginning of 2007 , the Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones at the end of 2007 .
he asked three units in one : a music player , a telephone and a Internet communication , all via touch screen easy to operate .
the winning train from Apple began , today the iPhone is the most important product of the group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market for the market .
finally , you finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the S@@ ages now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after the invention a self @-@ understanding .
on average , each Germans have meanwhile 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to learn all the smartphone even once again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , in the Siemens executive board for personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessi@@ bility now has a curse and blessing at the same time .
England has to extend the Olympic spirit and h@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only to bring in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country renovation and pro@@ sper@@ ity .
for me , the biggest attraction He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and we will be able to create new possibilities for local trade and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local congregations we are already able to create 10,000 new jobs , 40,000 new jobs and the youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead in London in 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of expansion He@@ ath@@ row is too large .
it has been said to me that England will never be ready for games and that we will be able to bl@@ am@@ end ourselves on the world stage .
the two fl@@ yers had been wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ sight , but He@@ ath@@ row answered every question .
how the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many , and not for individual infrastructure project .
extension is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in wit@@ ty growth and a legacy of skills and employment in order to leave both the airport as well as in whole GB .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 bn savings program in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the midst of the two frequencies of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is also one of its .
it &apos;s time to expand this Olympic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row , as well as our future trade , and create a legacy of skills and jobs to be proud of that England .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; box and mouse game &quot; regarding display block@@ age
for businesses who earn money with On@@ line@@ advertising money , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts , advertis@@ ements to a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday only two days after Facebook announced that it would blo@@ cked ad on his desktop page , adop@@ ting Ad@@ block Plus would update their filter to block their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ ard would change the coding regarding his advertis@@ ements to identify it , which is part of the page advertising that is part of the page advertising to make difficult to recogn@@ ise .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to get the new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle between the invention of the source community and the revolution has already been possible since the invention of advertis@@ ers in G@@ ange is , &quot; and that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media was launched in the fight , is a powerful inde@@ xes for the industry .
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ ol@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people were born around the world ; almost four times so much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users active users who have access Facebook over their mobile devices , hand advertising is 84 percent of the advertising material .
furthermore , the company has no effect on desktop computers in addition to mobile ad blocks no effect on fac@@ eb@@ ooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , divided a speaker .
advertisement on Desktop PC makes a sufficient great share of revenue so that Facebook has to be worth the investment of such a st@@ ep@@ ly worth it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday Facebook with that there would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad reference pool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to update the people more control over them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook has claimed that Ad@@ block add new filters , because they would also block content on the side that are no advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for users , we have no positive experience , therefore we plan to access the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one spokes@@ man of Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , why we have focused on developers like Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of people .
woman in thought suicide on Swiss fre@@ eway
the sacrifice was in the middle of the night on the fre@@ eway .
the police calls witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday with a suspected self @-@ suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman put in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a act of desp@@ air &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police in V@@ aud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss stay at the age of 49 , who wanted to drive out of several vehicles , including a truck , to kill himself .
she died on site .
several drivers have already been taken , but some are still not identified , the police rejected these as well as any witnesses of the incident .
an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , the G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait , whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
this is something that the prosecutor must decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the past five years show that the drivers will not be moved to responsibility .
in each of the two cases - for which one person was in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers cannot assume that a pedestrian walk in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was called in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ ew@@ ed of neg@@ ligent murder had been acquitted when they had a man over and killed one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and has become conscious of un@@ conscious , the court received .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the court noted that the polic@@ ew@@ oman had responded to a not@@ ice@@ ably good way and that the presence of a man on the road was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely exceptional and un@@ predic@@ table situation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges , should announce the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model dell : Venus was once gu@@ arded
the Venus was probably inhab@@ itable according to the projec@@ tions of a new NASA climate model probably inhab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to detect the past the Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ bles those of clim@@ atic research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could be con@@ tested with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists previously informed that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the most recent simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin @-@ like atmosphere and yet slowly revers@@ ed .
the model lit also the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet thought to be more dry than the earth , but had once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and in@@ car@@ ving faster evap@@ oration .
early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow revolution of Venus was almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ med the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer clouds , which works as a rain@@ bow to par@@ agli@@ ding the surface from most of the solar heat .
the result are average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than the earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resem@@ bles the evolution that was previously thought of Planet@@ arium research .
although it was probably hab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to Venus in the course of several billion years --@@ too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their ocean evap@@ or@@ ated and its water vap@@ or was burned from ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen , there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today .
the researchers part@@ ed the results of its new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy joins as a coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and resulted in low @-@ term participation in the decision process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new trainer immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as chief trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expressed by the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a position . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think in the course of the summer long and much , as I could improve this team to give him more depth to give it to a higher level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation .
he must also have a specific right to make decisions which influence the performance of the team .
these terms are currently not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who was born on 23 May 2013 , would be pleased with him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we appreciate all what he did for our organisation and wish him for the future only the best .
Roy was honored during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adam Awards as the best coach of the league .
he led the association to 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of Play@@ offs from Minnesota and missed the last for the last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded in the 2015 @-@ 16 season with a 39 @-@ 39 mark and fell behind the wild for a second wild @-@ card spot in the Western Conference around five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal , Montreal and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nord@@ es@@ ee@@ pers will take talks again , put a strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lab@@ yrinth for North Sea workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exposed to the table for a new talk round at the table , said the negoti@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the Wood Field Company Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally operated on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group as well as the unions and r@@ ushing unions can confirm that we have agreed to rest@@ art the process of the current battle , &quot; says it in a joint statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will keep some full @-@ day meetings over the next few weeks that will start coming early next year to start the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 per cent is .
the Wood Group has shortened the key to its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market printing .
the company &apos;s rating short@@ ening follows a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company gives the necessary space to come up by the market swing .
Shell has dismissed and plans for its part of thousands of people and plans to aband@@ ons its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ us@@ ement aims at the BG energy company BG Group .
energy companies are due to lower cru@@ de oil prices under pressure , an economic situation that had to leave the European Union by decision of the British in June .
the Scottish parliament members Dave Anderson met in the beginning of this week with working workers to discuss one of the largest labour force since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and all the country we need a economy that works for many , and not only for a few works , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 there are less than $ 1.4 billion for new projects in the North Sea , compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the stell@@ ations of the Ple@@ j@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ ding teles@@ cope helped astronom@@ ers to collect the complete catalogue of rot@@ ors under the stars of the star Wars .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers , why stars are rot@@ ated to different r@@ allies , as well as in which the rotation periods are standing with the planet walls .
&quot; we hope that through the same results of our results with other con@@ stell@@ ations , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the con@@ stell@@ ations of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 445 light@@ years away from the Earth .
many stars in this constellation , which emerged from some 125 million years ago , reach the adult .
they are fastest now on the fastest .
for top rotating rates of these attack@@ ing stars great quantities of star@@ ters .
since these winds are travelling through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a s@@ wap effect on the stars .
when a star starts , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each risk by taking the time between the appearing of a recogni@@ z@@ able star rate -- like solar fle@@ cks -- recognizes .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ations@@ rates indicates that massive stars slower than a less massive stars .
re@@ aker compens@@ ates the stars with dancers , with a larger star slower pi@@ rou@@ ds lower than smaller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s see that slow rot@@ ors should tend to be massive , while maintaining faster rotation , very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the con@@ stell@@ ations of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the con@@ stell@@ ations of the P@@ lei@@ ades has an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a lot of us what we want to learn more about how , when , and why stars mar@@ g@@ lows its red ro@@ ofs , and so do their &quot; dance shoes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their newest analysis of rotation rates of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , which will soon appear in the astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversi@@ al Bas@@ eball @-@ Star
the tears ran with Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US bas@@ eball Star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional re@@ viewing announcement , the 41 @-@ year old professional will play against T@@ amp@@ a Bay around the Tri@@ p@@ at of his New York Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es for the last time .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tell &quot; Good@@ bye &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game participants in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has been awarded US $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contra@@ sts on 31 December 2017 , he performs as a consultant and youth coach - at full content .
as a player , Rodri@@ guez paid long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 @-@ 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 @-@ 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed to take some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays have only two other bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old was not included in the glory of the Bas@@ eb@@ ur@@ ism .
for this is successful Rodri@@ guez - nickn@@ ame &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field , so the occurr@@ ence outside of the square .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was launched at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed due to a processing of the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ guez applies as the main suspected , years of experience over an anti @-@ A@@ ging hospital in South Florida to obtain more productive funding .
after a dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 encoun@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have already done for the year 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez said at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his f@@ arewell days are not dis@@ appointing .
during many bas@@ eball @-@ le@@ gen@@ ds in their last games , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bank .
&quot; my job does not include any f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; et@@ ched Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ard@@ i .

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first D@@ op@@ ing@@ slope
knowing : because of a positive d@@ op@@ ing@@ sample , there is no weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be over@@ sh@@ aded by the first official dos@@ ages .
a caught athl@@ ete could have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ ra@@ ids became known as the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s Olympic Games .
the Chinese swimming pool in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obst@@ acle course from Bulgaria and the Polish ge@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested in Brazil and is excluded - immediately before the beginning of the sole athlet@@ ics competitions this message are coming to the accident .
in Ch@@ en already last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de has been demonstrated that is used as a mas@@ cul@@ ating means for op@@ op@@ ing@@ ing distances .
the International Sport@@ court Court CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon with their exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupies the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly , only by 0.0@@ 09 seconds , they missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to participate in the operations of 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
Ch@@ en applied the opening of the B @-@ Trial ( IOC ) at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua in a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work together with the International Sport Court of CA@@ S and will accept the judgement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history is no longer the IOC but the CA@@ S is responsible for the rehabilitation of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athlet@@ ics &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is supposed to act to the associated substance by the E@@ d@@ op@@ ing@@ ote EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was a pro@@ vision@@ ally suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ Trial has also been positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ jko Bor@@ is@@ sow joined the athl@@ ete about the athl@@ ete about the athl@@ ete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes won &apos;t go the right mud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , approximately all weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter from the chron@@ ically un@@ loaded nation could not participate in Rio .
on Friday , the &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; in class up to 85 kg was also known as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z had been positive for three days earlier on the an@@ ab@@ olic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both deposits , however , are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg .
prior to the start of athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another he@@ avier stroke for the rep@@ lica of the entire sport .
the world association IA@@ AF had the complete Russian team until an exception due to systematic D@@ op@@ ings the start , also the farmers produced in Kenya in Rio numerous bad news .
in the swimming @-@ sport , the former leaders in China had also helped for intense con@@ disputes between the athletes .
the Fr@@ ench@@ man Camil@@ le Lac@@ our@@ t took the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang har@@ sh .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt l@@ ila &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium about 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I will pass &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also at the heart of a debate with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for doping control , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positive in 2014 with the Chinese championships a positive effect on the stim@@ ul@@ ans Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit down a three @-@ month sper@@ ity .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de press h@@ acker you ran@@ s@@ om their ran@@ s@@ om
programmer by pressing malware , currently targeted companies - and are successfully successful .
according to a recent survey of the malware infection specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ooks under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany were 40 percent of survey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months at least once , some of several victims of a attack with compres@@ ser software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies have already been the target of a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware detection .
40 per cent of the victims , they will@@ ingly offered by the perpet@@ rators , to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their de@@ press@@ or software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ooks to attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential soldering money falls significantly higher than for private use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we observe a sc@@ rap@@ ing fast evolution of damage software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ooks @-@ CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs have been designed to send advertis@@ ements .
then discovered the perpet@@ r@@ ator software for itself .
only in the past few months , private use the target , but the change took place in the past months .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is working after a simple pattern : once on the computer of an Op@@ ens , she sear@@ ches after un@@ long changed files such as WordPress , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as archives of pictures and videos .
these files are encrypted with R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustainable .
afterwards , the software presents the demands of the pres@@ sur@@ fers .
in order to receive the turn@@ key code to the files , the victims must provide money - mostly in the form of the cryp@@ t bit@@ coin - .
but where private use the personal photo database on the game , it goes to companies with sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage dropped out if a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware falls .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 percent had to complete the business activities even when people were living in hab@@ itations .
in Germany there were already several hospitals in attacks , whose patients can be threatened by loss of symptoms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say the victims , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pays not , you only promotes the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies have to pay their data .
for managers , it is difficult to refuse to re@@ ject the requirement of the perpet@@ rators .
the h@@ acker turn again and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a current study , the security for@@ ter of F @-@ Secure exam@@ ines the usage surfaces and contact with the pres@@ sur@@ prises and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators attempt to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
you explain your victims by chat , as they can pay by bit@@ coin , freely accessible support sites or de@@ cryp@@ t for free example files .
and they will be saved to payments of a few hundred euros , companies must be part of hard , and five @-@ digit sum@@ s to rep@@ ay their data .
given the potential high and relatively risk gains from the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware detection , the h@@ acker will always share professional and share their work , explains safety examination Ch@@ ester O@@ ni@@ ewski by antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware circa within one week . &quot;
it is more likely to be more than three or four people .
the programmer sell their damage software then in the form of a software construction to the actual compression .
the previous malware kits produced by malware , advice and additional tools for one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10.000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delivery includes a custom@@ ization , so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pres@@ ets are then looking for further ch@@ ipper to spread the fresh@@ ly bought software under the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so in one of the for@@ ums , one of the for@@ ums bought the set of a crime and commissioned one further to install the software on as many PCs .
payment is made per final calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , the crime then sp@@ ammer on dissem@@ ination with dissem@@ ination , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ewski .
the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now known to provide their data better by many companies .
over 50 percent of companies @-@ IT @-@ persons employed in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ooks survey confidence to trust R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are pursu@@ ing new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is no adequate threat , the perpet@@ rators instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or quot@@ ation , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ooks @-@ CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
this is the claim of damage according to type of data by a multiple bit higher than before .
in future , the perpet@@ rators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things on the grain .
on the h@@ ack@@ er@@ conference def@@ con demonstrated security for@@ scher , as they were able to receive thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of a der@@ art blocks could be quite a ran@@ s@@ om benefit .
if the perpet@@ r@@ ator then instead of heating in the future a whole production street in a factory could block R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware also in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and easy @-@ to @-@ use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything a little SUV , a little coupé and also the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds pretty un@@ loading , but the HR @-@ V that was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , has actually proved very flexible in everyday life .
although only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the F@@ ond , there is no spot close .
the interior materials of the interior space are well processed and works perfectly , only the cockpit surface falls below .
versatile than comparable vehicles , the HR @-@ V is the storage space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not just a trunk of 453 l with highly provided and 10@@ 26 l when folded back cushions , but there are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less mag@@ ically , as it sounds : the seat surfaces of the re@@ bank can be removed like Kin@@ os@@ essel and offer the storage room that is up to ceilings 1,@@ 24 m high .
the trunk compartment can be loaded well , however , the charging height is 650 mm somewhat higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
he is likely to judge his work yet .
the everyday consumption is 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is still another engine ization : a 1.5 l petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the bike is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
but the steering is likely to be direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment can be opened in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city emergency braking system is one of the city emergency braking ( working up to Tempo 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and trace @-@ assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the coll@@ ision ir@@ r@@ assed sometimes , because he won many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her@@ edit@@ ary objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very reliable works of the remote control assistant .
and the intelligent speed controller respon@@ ds to the traffic sign recognition and dro@@ s@@ sel@@ t when needed .
the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touchscreen , Nav@@ i , App integration and more .
two USB@@ - and HDMI socket lie below the arm@@ rest and are therefore a little bit to reach .
the around 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ equipped diesel engines are fine .
who doesn &apos;t want to invest so much , the fuel will be from 20000 Euro , diesel from 23@@ 000 Euro .
the engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday use .
Airline is not liable : down@@ fall on passenger bridge
a airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
for a liability is only possible for haz@@ ards , which are typical for air traffic , argu@@ ing the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken off with the overthrow of a k@@ nee .
however , the accident could have happen everywhere - it should be a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline had no compensation to the man .
disease cases : when paid to the organis@@ er
after their journey would only get money back when the cause of the disease is des@@ per@@ ate free of charge in the hotel .
but this is only the case , if more than ten percent of the guests of the same symptoms show the same symptoms .
in the promised case , a family was difficult to break in the second day of her Turkish bath and vom@@ iting .
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their disease led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a defective Kl@@ oten , which allegedly poll@@ uted se@@ a@@ water .
the family was a view that was in order to be f@@ law@@ fully and was accused against the organis@@ er .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
although the pur@@ ification in fact was defective .
however , the organizer was just before leaving the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to go out till then , that the se@@ a@@ water was fine .
so he didn &apos;t have viol@@ ated its information obligations so the verdict .
especially in the samples of water no im@@ pur@@ ities have been found .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by pressing one another - is a general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests , only 38 people were ill .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said after refugees among refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July many people had care against further attacks .
the state must be so@@ ber and determined by the same time at the same time .
safe is : our country will not answer the violence of perpet@@ rators with hat@@ red and split .
we will not do this triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when off@@ ences would have left the country , increase the safety and strength also the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to reach the proposals until the German Bundestag election in 2017 .
he also announced another person@@ ic ampli@@ fication of the security forces , namely &quot; in medium four @-@ digit magn@@ itude over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ ize with terrorism and punishment again under punishment .
video surveillance should be improved , the ce@@ ase@@ fire will be as amended , especially the purchase of weapons will be worth on the internet .
the last much @-@ discussed silence light for doctors is supposed to remain un@@ disputed after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
however , in dialogue with the sleeves , he wants to search for solutions , such as endang@@ ering the citizen , he said with a view to psych@@ ic powers .
in order to accept a radi@@ alisation of refugees , the ministers holds a better social supervision .
teachers have to be prepared to deal with traum@@ atic human beings .
for the persecution of crimin@@ als in special fields of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning an investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD CEO Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to speak about everything that contributes to safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior must be pronoun@@ ced against action .
&quot; this was a ear@@ nest for the Schar@@ endi@@ ces in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union to a Bur@@ ka @-@ ban and the abol@@ ition of a double citizenship earlier .
a general prohibition of complet@@ eness and retention is un@@ problem@@ atic for the constitu@@ tionally problem@@ atic .
you can &apos;t offer everything you refuse and I rest the carrying out of the Bur@@ ka .
there you can talk about rules regarding road traffic or witnesses before judgment .
green @-@ Chief , Simone Peter , designed to sim@@ ulate the minister , he would sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terrorism par@@ c@@ els and action capability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ part@@ ef Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fle@@ et Pro@@ ver@@ bs and a disappearance of stay right in this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway
it looked regularly on the surrounding road - here a picture from November .
however this is to change : the legal matter is to be extended .
this is a good news for all car drivers , who stand in professional traffic on the ambient road every evening in the St@@ au when you drive over the highway ( A 43 ) .
the road @-@ operation road is extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer street and the descent Wes@@ eler Street .
drive directly from the Hammer street to the right .
the major advantage : the transport divi@@ des early on , thus improving the overall exp@@ ir@@ ation in the complex section of the Federal Road 51 .
the idea of the extended exit had the CD@@ U Group in the District of Münster @-@ West .
driving on the Zu@@ br@@ inger nervous the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
the back@@ drop goes back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ ping road and sometimes also beyond .
reason for the con@@ i@@ fers at the B 51 is just before the Wes@@ eler street .
from here the traffic is guided via the motorway bridge over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be returned to a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge has no longer the required load capacity to absor@@ b the heavy traffic in particular .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will this bott@@ len@@ pass and the connected sten@@ cils , the competent company can &apos;t say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is said to reck@@ on with years : for the bridge has an official remaining use until 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal status of the law , the country is consci@@ ously sought to pay the traffic weak@@ ening time in the school holidays , because with disabilities .
the traffic will pass on Tuesday and Wednesday in front of the construction site .
intercultural trip : cultural offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule attended the drama scene &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the Club N@@ IMA &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a musical project now .
the Association N@@ IMA &apos;s enables young people with migration and refugee camps to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wald@@ haus Children &apos;s school has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young Theatre in Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the association N@@ IMA &apos;s initiated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Intercultural Travel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association has been offering cultural integration of young people with mig@@ rant and refugee camp , schools with welcome classes are the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most young people of the class be between September 2015 and March 2016 among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and say little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ograph@@ ies , the scen@@ ic images and video animations have been possible to follow these things , as the press release of the boys theatre in Münster .
the Association N@@ IMA &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from language , and the Young Theatre will work in the coming season during a musical theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without flu@@ ent and migration background between 14 and 20 years have the possibility to visit professional courses in the areas of singing , dance , spectac@@ le and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre and the@@ atri@@ ation@@ ists are in planning .
the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; goes further .
given the rise of refugees , the association expects to participate in many classes , who want to participate .

slow night : tips against ins@@ om@@ nia
in the evening , you wake up forever , at night you arrive at night , in the morning it is no more thinking about sleep .
this is all other than relaxing .
at least one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , approximately one quarter of adult sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and more than ten percent can find their sleep frequently or permanently relaxing .
how external problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
there are several forms of ins@@ om@@ nia , and it can be destroyed by them diverse causes , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , board member of the German Society for induc@@ tors and sleeping medicine .
whatever you understand , however , the In@@ som@@ nie , so it is an input and as@@ le@@ ep .
just the passage can be found many people as un@@ satisfactory or in@@ adequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the German house association with practice in Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
the causes of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces are complex .
behind , organic , mental or behavi@@ oral factors , but also medicines .
it is not rare , the sleeping distur@@ bing of a different condition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early wake is often often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it may be that different factors have one another .
who , for example , has a band@@ age , can be bad@@ ly lying , w@@ akes every two to three hours and starts to gre@@ edy about everyday problems and take care of gre@@ edy , there is no such an example .
that leads to tension , and sleep is not possible anymore .
when should one sleep with sleeping disorders ?
those who do not sleep for a period of one month in at least three nights per week , should be imp@@ aired , should go to a doctor .
the impair@@ ment can look very different : one is beaten , tired , un@@ distur@@ bed , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is slightly del@@ ight@@ ful , mood fluctu@@ ations or physical complaints like mag@@ nets or head@@ aches .
in order to lin@@ t the sleep disorder , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options are among other behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cogn@@ itive behavi@@ oral therapy or other medicines - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and most for two weeks .
it hardly exists in Germany in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. Ingo Fi@@ xed , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Research Center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
this is why you should first contact with sleeping difficulties at home , av@@ eng@@ ing we@@ e@@ ß .
it can clari@@ fy with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should come into the sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for investigation in the sleeping laboratory , medical equipment for instance with re@@ spir@@ ators , with disease @-@ ti@@ red@@ ness , when sleeping , or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a passage distur@@ b@@ ance , Fi@@ bre .
we do not need to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please make no lunch break , &quot; says Fi@@ xed .
after the shortened you enter into the bed for its normal time .
beside the electrodes the body you bear a nas@@ al glasses , a chest strap and a fen@@ ders on fingers .
in addition , a camera is attached to the sleeping corner .
how can people get the problems in the handle ?
there are quite many screws , where one can set for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß is counts : regular sleep , not too long in bed , on the day not sleep , not watching television to sleep , alcoh@@ ol@@ den and night not at the clock - then it &apos;s time to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s completely and not eligible .
what the jung@@ le camp with lack@@ ing medals in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has been viewed by Facebook to dis@@ appointing the DS@@ V teams in the Olympic Games .
in December 2014 , he had brought gold for the first time in Doha and presented his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler was placed on Facebook in front of his cr@@ iti@@ que ex @-@ team@@ work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country in which a Olympic champion will get 20,000 € reward and a jung@@ le ch@@ efs at 150.000 € should no wonder about missing medals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on Friday on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conveyor system in the swimming @-@ sport is po@@ or@@ ly , the d@@ op@@ ing@@ controls is very good .
with this , we can &apos;t compete with countries who are very much power@@ ing and operate in the topic D@@ oping not so precisely or even running it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have already been reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
it is exactly how to keep it with countries .
&quot; whoever does not receive a certain time before the WM / OS of independent controller of WA@@ DA / F@@ INA , may not participate , &quot; calls for the Hamburg election , which has meanwhile an ice@@ di@@ ele .
airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ gage was arrested
professional th@@ ieves at the airport Düsseldorf
civil servants of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police accomplished the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the facts had committed as bonds and Bag@@ gage carriers .
at 21.@@ 30 o &apos;clock civil servants involved in the area of the airport Düsseldorf , a band again known that the polic@@ emen from last theft was known .
the two women and two men had committed several dol@@ ik@@ te since the middle of July this year and were particularly professional .
the Speci@@ alists of Cri@@ me Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can refer to the di@@ apos@@ iti@@ oning of criminal off@@ ences after Germany , four works follow .
they took over 15,000 Euro in total .
old buildings , a few linear pav@@ ement , in between another head@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain works on the first sight , but the police counts them to the &quot; dangerous locations &quot; of the city .
take the road from east to west along the street comes to play@@ grounds , a refresh@@ ed nur@@ ser@@ y and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the facade of a grey house has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite to a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demolished , it will already be built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created here .
articles about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; such as the competent real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , are usually preferred with burning cars in the last weeks .
reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was busy , meanwhile , the inhabitants of rental contracts , on the ground floor are still occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the Berlin &apos;s Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator , a tough prec@@ eded by the police against the project , the area as &quot; No @-@ Go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
after 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers were cleared , pat@@ rol over three weeks of official statements , with 30 to 40 civil servants and three team @-@ cars , closed parts of the road and kept visitors from them to enter the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , its renovated construction worker on behalf of the unknown Haus@@ er @-@ owner &apos;s rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin administration Court decided that the pol@@ ation was illegal , and one day later moved police and construction workers under the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ izers and inhabitants .
on this summer afternoon , the road peaceful : parents walk to children , people sit on the office in front of the houses in the sun , others keep front spo@@ ils .
in the immediate vicinity of the skin projects there are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main concern of many inhabitants : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , which has been living in the Kie@@ z , and J@@ ana * , who are three children who have been traveling here from the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the skin projects they share the concern about increasing and gent@@ len@@ ess .
it doesn &apos;t sound after a Kie@@ z , who wanted to un@@ wanted police plaster on v@@ and@@ alism on the left .
the tr@@ ench , which the Berliner Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator and the police between household factors and their neighbours , obviously does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working quarter , which is also today a low average income and a high risk of poverty .
the occupied residential projects and the resulting residential projects belong to the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been cleared among a large police bom@@ bed , many of the projects were leg@@ alised in the Rig@@ id and are still inhabited by people still occupied by people 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become increasingly on the mag@@ nets for tourists and election liner from around the world : with them the inhabitants of GDR times and former house he became their Kiev .
this makes also the h@@ iring remarkable , which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : you recognize them into consumed slices or fresh@@ ly dot@@ ted fac@@ ades , which were subjected to colours .
no other road was so often mentioned in the words &quot; lin@@ ks@@ autonomous violence &quot; in this year .
a reason for that not all neigh@@ bors could see the problem that they are not necessarily affected by the crime : off@@ ences such as body injuries , statistics are estimated that almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the criminal off@@ ences make non @-@ damage arising from the newly built and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , which has been living in a rental house next to the controversi@@ al 94 years , no speech can be given by un@@ certainty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what violence goes , it is advis@@ able : the people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bors who are not intended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the famous burning cars will also give it right in the Rig@@ id already longer .
for those studied archit@@ ect@@ in is their road no crime focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives along the street and get more one another , then somewhere else . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consci@@ ously drawn into the Rig@@ id street - and stayed .
therefore it was so important that the residents receive their road : from the police , politics and the media , who claimed the De@@ ut@@ ili@@ arch over the district in July .
but in the eyes of inhabitants like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : by spl@@ ay@@ eless new@@ buildings in former building g@@ aps that the old residents remains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are finally the con@@ domin@@ iums , which are not interesting for many , - here are rather people who are not so well done &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction may I not be gu@@ arded . &quot;
but what should one do if someone listening to someone ?
there is also a fru@@ str@@ ation on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
for Zu@@ er@@ zo@@ ic , who like more about colour bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiev .
who &apos;s going , should be aware of his - exactly like someone who moves into a bar @-@ quarter , so bad about noise can be har@@ der .
all only with the names of presented persons have asked to be called , not with their right name
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le is the contact partner in the integration and organizer .
in addition she is a social worker .
since July An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee contractor for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ y is supporting the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ w berger .
she sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , workers in refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else is mis@@ mixed .
Reg@@ ine client of the working group indicates that the volunteer are grat@@ eful more than than@@ k@@ ful that Deu@@ ter@@ le is now , the ei@@ ving Woll@@ st@@ sau , especially a problem .
so , some - less sp@@ ells than rather to the multitude of w@@ ishing tasks are targeted - common , when administration wanted to write the site .
looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , a jeal@@ ous Woll@@ ch@@ sau .
but administrative work is not its central area , An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially we go for organization , work with people on site and also behind the scenes and network activity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been present for around six weeks .
it has a 50 percent stake to three years .
&quot; it was the highest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le Hon@@ or and haupt@@ ian actors supported .
there are large and small problems , organiz@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
soon new containers are in the Was@@ en@@ straße
a he@@ avi@@ est problem has been found since some time to find flats for the connecting @-@ fle@@ ets that have been recognized .
the commun@@ es are responsible for the connection of the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented rooms .
the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the commun@@ es itself .
the responsibility changes from the Council to the municipality and the job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not any owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search have been a very difficult since some time .
de fac@@ to finds the administration of no private dwellings .
so far it did not work , unless you want to have private dwellings , Deu@@ ter@@ le .
therefore , non @-@ common dwellings must be not@@ ori@@ ous , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are placed in the Was@@ en@@ strasse .
but only with apartments are not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , are Reg@@ ine customer and An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le .
in addition to a fixed lead , there are trainees , training courses , school places , one @-@ euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who need to be folded or arranged .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many works in the building yard or help home @-@ care , non @-@ profit work - and the motiv@@ ated and very ti@@ dy , as An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reported .
it hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive impact effect .
this is &quot; no employment therapy &quot; .
activity , but not only work .
the day need a fixed structure , saying Deu@@ ter@@ le and Customer .
people would have to develop a cour@@ ageous feeling .
so it offers offers such as sport , contacts with loc@@ als and in particular language courses .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
so here administration and hon@@ ours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is centrally located that the refugees get the feeling they are in Germany and welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot;
long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they need to explain the refugees that it lasts , and they can sense it to time , for example with language courses .
who sometime the feeling of development , he could not work in Ur@@ bach , thirst , do not work and be un@@ profitable , who will never integrate it .
the distinct majority be motiv@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; problem cases , however , is the hon@@ est , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people , in which nothing goes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ ter@@ le and client is therefore always motiv@@ ating others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all these have been a &quot; Mamm@@ ut@@ ess &quot; job . &quot;
a difficult question : did the two after the youngest inci@@ dents in front of radi@@ cal@@ ization , also in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what lack of n@@ ai@@ v call &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a residual risk could be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but would not exclu@@ de it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sen@@ si@@ bil@@ ites are the hel@@ per already .
these inci@@ dents were also topic with refugees .
they had the fear that the assassination attempt in call it completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to show that they don &apos;t have nothing to do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so we need to keep main and hon@@ est@@ ations on site and in the region of activities .
they always have in the background , that soon a new stores of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a limit ?
this question is clear to answer the policy .
actually it is un@@ fair to set her hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach , where we would like , &quot; says An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher has also been used to integrate the existing human beings .
these are currently around 100 persons , mainly young men .
but if people are in trouble you are helping them , both women are involved .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no easy answers .
