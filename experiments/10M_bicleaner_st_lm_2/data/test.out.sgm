<seg id="1">Clintons and trumps economic policy comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">In infrastructure invest in infrastructure and prevent trade agreements TTP - that's both Clinton as well as Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidate, however, are not affected by the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">Among the differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">He, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to hold the doubts more small and warn before, as the state of economy can harm - with tax and regulation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton establish the economy to death and regulate the economy, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be different, claims of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will return to regulators, and he makes himself strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for businesses and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton said to Clinton: the state has given certain tasks to fulfil, he has disadvantageous chances to open and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes were increased for the rich's wealth, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">To be invested in the committees, Trump and Clinton is almost equal.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidates announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are rejected by the state-rite part of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump, so you could get more partisan discussion.</seg>
<seg id="17">Clearly visible are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal plants and return the coal output in the USA again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction is also expected to be protected in so far protected areas to open the climate agreement in the Parisian climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton intends to enhance renewable energies with its investment program, and calls for "a country the superpower of clean energies will create and million jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want to be there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only for the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, both competitor are not far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the immunity-fish trade agreement, both will not sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time both the USA does not want to isolate from international trade, but simply protect the American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">That should then be paid better, about Clinton requires about Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hungry.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to raise it up to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump in this question is not clear: once again he says: the minimum wage must be, then he says he will not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop the fiscal policy of both bearings.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one side, Trump, which aims to boost the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics keep his critics, so that the budgetary deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand Clinton, who wants to ask at least of the rich men that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not even the solution.</seg>

<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan," "" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan" "" "said to his" "" "Friend" "" "- according to a report of all five times." ""</seg>

<seg id="10">On the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have happened as it would never be a little worse.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm was rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin exams, sustainable and boldness revealed that the Russian state of Russia had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "rather, the cause of the crisis was the first, which he mentioned in his introductory statement," "" "the shot of a Russian campaign by Turkey on the Syrian border through Turkey." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow reaction to the time was wutentated.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin made up and accused Ankara, Russia in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was even bigger, because it was committed by a thought friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the vocal again, it is difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media had a severe, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once, it seemed, when the Turks would bear for everything the debt.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the most serious accusations of conductive officials reported that Erdogan had benefited from illegal oil trade in territories of Syria, which shall be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has fought this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg, the official message that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received from President Erdogan to the debt that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a way victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of an armistice is clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs all friends which he can get from the last month with a failed coup d "coup d" état in a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Again, terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there is economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions met in Turkey - especially the prohibition of chartered volcano, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operator and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They are count on a late seasonal harvest of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the State's television exceeds fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imported will be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated this way:" "" "tourists long, tomatoes here long" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is going down to the West as the response to the tried power of power tried to oversight the weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this, the continuing Groll come across the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the invents on it is to go out from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, Russian Minister of State won a bonus for this, that he requested the attempted coup d "état for the selected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well known for Moscow, a self-comprehensivity, that himself has a deepest fear of rain.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace in the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one, as it described me a analyst once described, "Alliance of Foreign Affairs" represented: two countries that have off the West and feel poorly treated and flawed.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow was recently the role as peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey will support each other sites.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be noted that after almost three hours of first discussions both president told the press conference that they didn't have the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey avoided it to answer a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphasise this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no unique confession about it, where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster than NATO member Turkey's Russian combat jet - it is certainly better to talk about the two heads of state.</seg>

<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin was unmaintenance in the way to his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was a lot of years part of the most famous confidentiality of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed special responsibility for environmental and transport services.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a statement by the Kremlin it reads that Putin without specifying the dismissal of Ivanovs of his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had joined Ivanovs since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in Tallinn in Tallinn, Germany, in 1972, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is (in Russian) that he later served the Chief Apostle and Stabsction of the Government sonale.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said about his appointment," "" "thank you for your trust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activities as a state of Chief of Law and controls on the implementation of your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked for his post to leave his post and have recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious wounding.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time of a close confidence in Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet secret service, KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, that was broadcasted on television in television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff has returned to his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the wages for cameras, only few of them are convinced - especially in front of the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a sort of power?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who was formerly known as potential president, wants to lead to lead the Russian environmental policy - joined large skepticsis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, which will be quoted on the website of the Kremlin, said Ivanov "It is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation - one could almost tell me - it could rely four years long.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turned out, I've been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov recorded the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin's former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, as Putin was chairman of the Bundessianic service (FSB), who was named KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people, to whom he confided in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once again, Ivanov could have been elected president of Russia after putting into the second term of office in Russia, as a third term of putting into the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this item was taken by another, near allies of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin was Prime Minister before he became president of three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion-expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>

<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of a conceptual art by a truly epic dimensions in this project with more than 30.000 ton of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the sealing between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a heighing activity, which require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, almost 79% of the total bridge will be available at their place and the last section of the deck today gets to Rosyth on the deck, which means that the total deck is ready to be lifted up to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first clasp is a considerable milestone in each bridge project.</seg>

<seg id="15">After installation of the last road-up and its connection with the Northern-deck-deck, we had to be able to close the gap in the north or land side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling the northern wooden bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very hot activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, as the viadukt 222 meters long, approximately 6,000 tons weighs and had to be moved up with a gradient of about 3%.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It's fascinating, how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teens and child for games do not go beyond outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time to spend your free time on screens, was complained in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">For Pokemon Go there is to pick up people from the sofa and be active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and last to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Hence, it's great to see that technology and activities will not include outdoor items.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm interested in the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characteristics that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later there was a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture decreased slightly ahead of the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within less days, Pokémon Go has more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go out with their smartphone after outside and search for Pokémons that are persecuted with a GPS and once they were found, "photographed" (about a screenshot on the phone) or "captive."</seg>
<seg id="13">One generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the winding and jumped to the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the US, the game resulted in a considerable increase in steps that the" "" "average" person will return every day. "" "</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiac, an app for Apple Watch, which followed 35,000 users, told that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of followed people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent every day.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays of which Pokémon Go - it looks like the raw data for performance improvements.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public educational campaigns are to take care of" "" "30 minutes" "" "to take the sofa" "" "of the sofa" "" "to deaf" "" "to deaf" "" "to deaf" "" "every day, because many public messages are boring to health and boring of people who look forward." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport not be verified.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who drives regularly sports, reduces its chances to treat cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages, which is too long to introduce them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the miraculous Pokémon Go is that people bring the people to do something in the open thing that fun is fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine and fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close to the hunt even new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are mashed gambled, which must always be chargeable over something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against one door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit already could follow our activity earlier than Fitbit, they gave us no reason to drive sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">New will lose its friction and the use will be followed by the time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons success, there will be more Games to be able to make apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will help many people on the hunt, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="5">Dynamic on the springhorse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortlessly on the beams.</seg>
<seg id="7">Stunning on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">On full line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now the Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American Turnerin erklóm on Thursday to the majority vote and enlarged the gap between the eyes and the rest of the world in front of all eyes of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">The overall results of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team kameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal in Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Americans Simone Biles turneth on the pig-balancing of women in art at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth-heterosexual American woman who wins a majority vote and a total of the fifth, while they profane their reputation, the best of their generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">They broke down in tears, when her end result was shown and her long journey was found at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This achievement is reflected in the same division like a unique athlete, like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports at new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles dominated the last three years, 15 world champion, including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton said that they have ever seen "the best gymnast, which I ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It was expecting a final examination in Brazil, a contest, which went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not return with a handful gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman moved poor, after they have won gold and silver in single multilingual campaign at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she retired in the farewell party of the team coordinator Martha Karolyi as Ausrubassigns.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although it was on top of it, during their long waymarks on the top, never the future is planned, that is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of its floor exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is tailored to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boormans Mutter during a school trip to the gym, was trained in Boorman.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has lost no multi competition competition for the summer 2013, a winning streak, which is such as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Model afina was slightly truncated through two filings, the image destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">Suljballet and Boats - in which Biles holds the world title - lurk.</seg>
<seg id="28">She again took over 15,433 on the pig-balloon again - and set it on a 15.933 on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman boarred them gently as she expected her duality - a pure formality - and tears flowed on Biles shiny red, white and blue Eyeliner, when the vision described it once in their collection book.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time the 22-year-old team capitalised, which is called by the Americans "Oma," a ledge.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her soil practices, she cast off the public court, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes doubtful appeared.</seg>
<seg id="33">What it concerns, so the fast-wide Tweet of the 19-year-old has a completely new meaning:</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who buys sound records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men love medium-aged plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you go to comment in order to transmit him under the pseudonym 'non-algal-patient-patient-patient age, this statement runs from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the versatile recovery of sound plates do not want to welcome to a boom in millennials, who want to welcome the realism of physical objects, but due to Midlife-nostalgic.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a record, are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most probable cat group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hormones through hobbysers - it has an emotional meaning: older plate runners retain their feelings to spend (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But agree the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would follow news report on TV, I would like to follow me in the midst of a busy street in Soho, while I stand still in the midst of a busy street in Soho, before I stand, my hands hold and something like: "so let's let us take a closer look."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's throw at a glance.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of SoHos is slowly gathering at his charm, hotels, restaurants and offices are now complete the buildings where independent sellers are based - there is a handful of fantastic record stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera of camera to switch the camera for the next part, in which I stand in the immediate vicinity of different men in such stores and try to estimate their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I of Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men mean age) into the Reckless Records (data number: eight men mean age), one woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, ask I?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I think," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound plates, above the top (he sent me to the snapshot by e-mail, I was not followed by him), suffer from the walls of his room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why it owns an such significant number of albums and singles, the result of its available income: it is now able to buy records, which he did not have appeared to buy and again objects which he sold, when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 1960s, early '70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought something too young was to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "he is true that those who buy the plates, are more vending, and would like to spend some time, and adds:" "" "I don't smoke and I drink not much." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my faster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes also that many customers who hits the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the Medienhpe, people who heard about the comeback and to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the conversations that I have led, people were generally emptained about 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that were once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom of a certain age of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It just takes some seconds in a business such as phonica to recognise that disk stores offers a soothing community of equivalents.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some plate fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to return to the stability of confided sound quality envelopes, of objects that are happy to donor.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think, sometimes it can be the colt of a void or property of material property than a kind of comfort" "" "says Wez." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as a collector and I think it is so many people so.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to employ spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social worker!" "" "flutes a staff from a turntables." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM revealed that almost 50% of people that have bought a plate almost 50% of people who have not heard the last month.</seg>
<seg id="36">The poll found that 41% have had a record player whom they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, do not have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At that time of the news report I would probably look very concerned while I blush through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, the sounds of the Universe (data number: three men mean age) works, has a "trophy" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came first out here, and said," I have no record player but I would like to buy a radii sound plate, so that I can put it into the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage but it happens definitely.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive loads, less musikles.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, who first come slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, dedicated to the Schallplatten, almost a whole floor, has a blower audience, than I must go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists, pictures, teenagers and women aged aged.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beverage the latest synthesizers and right-packet pop instead of experiments - is it good to see such diversity in the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them seaweed out, but nagious mental traumata are difficult to be ordered when you stand for 30 seconds next to someone.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the shop for some minutes and considered the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">She is more shattered as a mannequin.</seg>
<seg id="50">They deserves not much, therefore the collecting of records does not make any real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear from a computer or other way, but the beauty of plates is... "they drives with a slanted sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop that is said that a new generation of record lovers will have inspired: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the note that Jeans Hotpants watches, I observe a group of young teenager eras to buy a group at Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter refused to buy a crow record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left, there is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential panels for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to set it.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that each attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers in the depths of SoHos for more then there is nothing to be harder.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others, even the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research projects showed that the results of YouGov must vote, at least in place-shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record people who exist in reality, record business and online games.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard in school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They did not spend their Thursday morning with security services through plate stores of Berwick Street and the leaves through records, while they are taking away an unsecret, 30-year old false presenter, which rises not aged over the shoulders of middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="3">At a trial, the authorities argued this week argued the authorities in Calais that people should provide 72 provisioning shops within the camp of goods, selling cigarettes or tea for 50 cents (40 Pence) or a simple meals for a few Euros in Provisional restaurants.</seg>

<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups distributed to the court that the shops and restaurants are important, as the free meals that are offered by the nationally supported union and other groups, not sufficient food for growing numbers in the camp.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at 7-seater Rugby came in the final on Thursday evenings during the last hurdle at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were defeated by a 43-7 Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji had a master class in the handling, side-stepping, back-back, liner and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic waist in any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat has been reconciled to the Silver medal - Great Britain's fourth day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The significant defeat of the Boys, 7-5 in the semifinal on the same day could return to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji had been defeated a 15-man team in the form of this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it is probably not that at least one Brite will hang a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former Chief of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost under Ryan every game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This folder will be weaving, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and caused the attacks of GBS out of spass.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. on, when you run in driving buses. the World Series winner went 5-0 to top, when Osea Kolinisau went down to the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With another four minutes playing time Jerry Tuwai has another attack out of the right corner which he walked.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly has the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A heaviest Tackle from Mitchell stops the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa a third gate, but the Fiji stopped only.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua came in the right corner a touchdown and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one for the re-fiff and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou preished by further weak hopper of the GB teams and stormed up to line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is so far as Fiji had been born to play the 7, while the GB are still common.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is so too.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced basic changes to half-time and closed the fijiic gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the ratios of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova ran after a brilliant intermediate play from Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7 but the game was already waiting for a long term in the South West Germany, whose fans snakes, flags tilted and danced on the triumphal.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame set the i bag bag with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Pfiff-önte, the Fijis impoverished and the GB are struck down and struck down in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-final with 20-5 defeated and the Great Britain pressed South Africa in a knob match from the race - Great Britain's conversion to the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive foot labour and achieved a gate under the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside teams, secured winning - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fight with the cancer of the trainer for rowing victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no biodeficiency gold as with these games and that will be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rowing until the last, 220 hard Hieve that enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in her golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only those who were sitting on the Ruder, there were three voices in the boat. the Echo of the trainer Robin Williams was present, the first women in the history of British Sports, who laid a scale of such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Your dominance was absolute, after all of you get 39.ter unstable operation, which is also exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant science within the surface of the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the kind of triumphs.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the Ruders, a battalion was given to grants the difference and there was no more useful than the trainer who would not survive the day before 30 months, when he was diagnosed with cancer when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do it, he spreads to everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather worse situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could be in the beginning of 2014, out of the season, could start what the interruption to a minimum, if this is the right term at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, therefore I needed to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">So it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing to itself is a challenge, but this makes it a bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the infertility of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve morning to speak somewhat more than otherwise, and tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, which was as centurion at the Royal Artillery Regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, "I was an emotional wreck. this is perhaps something extremely fast, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is repeated only how much of me is how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would have no one, therefore a massive thank you for him. he is the best coach of the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would have no better person for trainer or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning lost no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponent could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even during the last 500 meters, when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark started to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in process, lead in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to rip off.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make something Tolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted no fireworks today, we wanted to get a good result, going out and win the race, what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The pair will take for one year before it will make decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear next week on a wedding, their own with the TV adventures of Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Just want to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I would not say that it was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">This would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">It feels like much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Olympic Games, the Zen of Trampolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are too, as late as too, the Olympic Games are too late.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are durable and undefiled, a shaving relay between competition and streches.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is known as the Olympic torch itself was a burning rod, who protect the bracelets for the time of the Turner at the time of triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not switch to the TV, a newspaper read or listen to the talk about your neighbors in the queue, without having Simone Biles, Katie Lecovers, or the battle between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women with round dimples, could definitely be sent to Prime Time, constructed by sponsors and well-being TV advertisements if he was a swimmers, Turner or even Fender.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, Lake Forest, California, fighting for the olympic trampolines around gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports, which are not universally recognised: aerial pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may have it long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I have modest arguments for my particular lovers, then let me leave the attention to the discrete charm of the tramp.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolinip has been a Olympic event since 2000, when it had been in Sydney, the last 16 years so many that I had asked, did not know that there is a Olympic port.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional Ignorms.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA athletes won for the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampolines and had a athletes until 2012, who made it until the end of the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians to share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampolinip has a certain outdoor use, partly because it sounds for the unloaded ear to a clownsschool for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert but only a little enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristical potential - the Cartoonous citations of his never swollen swimmers - but also the grazie of gyms and diving, which combines two sports species, which essentially combines it essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as" "" "Sprungboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Upstream skip on a gigantic trampoline, shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and must have a number of falling movements (turning, hale and saltos) before they lending at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">You will be judged according to the official Olympiaprogram after execution, difficulty and "time" time. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Two young athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic Vektor is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists in their streches after gold further, faster, upward and upward, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes up and back, back to the playground and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">You will not only hunt the Ziellinie or the starting wall, but in the television transmission: the world or the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal is Nobel, admirable, even fanatic, even fanatic - and it's enough to stir even a viewer.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I would like to watch over this games as a bit more tired.</seg>
<seg id="30">It offers the trampoline a reboot time.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampolines is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A backward movement is not the target.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or prunt, seemingly heaviest, like a astronaut, goes to the top, then after the bottom, then effortlessly back to the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a contest, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the destination, no wolves in the distance, only the dreaming, elegant repeats of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is that Zen can only be Zen in the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final round of women will be held on Friday afternoon, in streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday also around 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will shine as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia-Manie they speak a quiet, nice moment, one who will probably see in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">When the sensation of consciousness can only be reached by the Angers and the object of male athletes - like the male US Turner, according to The Wall Street Journal, then Mr. Dooley expects his to air ring, new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror against the region, in particular in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if ever, get a lot of Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy grew in considerable pace.</seg>

<seg id="18">The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was more than a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued to continue through the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, but dissidents were effective to silence.</seg>

<seg id="27">At the same time, the tension along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this zag, controversial line called for hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts agree that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been enforced more or less, the turbulences could rise, and could be armed again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of biting after years of age is now explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper phones were increasingly more common and improved the Internet services.</seg>

<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopia gave it to protests, that they were gathered to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that it is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since 1991, Amharas has been prospersed the Amharas, mainly Christian high countries, in politics and economy, while they carried out the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and living in a flat land areas.</seg>

<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos did the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which account for about 6 percent of the population, and the military, in the intelligence, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "" "" "Mr Meles, a former rebellion until his death was an unsealed disease in 2012 for 17 years in Ethiopia's Prime Minister." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest tebroth is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland we usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after a study on board ship Sanna to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and floating with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland's Greenland got up to 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the Greenland about the north-Atlantic crossing, in an hour he is just 1.220 metres far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes up, the five-metre long animal accelerates to a whopping 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This longitude of loneliness seems to be a sponsorship for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reports in the journal "Science" at any time from a Greenland, the 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Schelllein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic Research in Rostock this lifespan, which means for vertebrates a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland will be stone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only missing the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland haves are difficult to observe, finally, they live mainly in the ice sea before the thin-populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer to water temperatures around 6 degrees Celsius, they usually dive on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">To know about the lifestyle of Greenland's lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their timescore limbs limbs they, when they presented six animals before Svalbard for six animals.</seg>
<seg id="18">Spoil this shark: in the stomach of a zoid, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had swallowed the pine bones of a young icbären.</seg>
<seg id="19">May you may chase them sleeping animals or patrol on the basis of the ice sea and seek Kadaver, which torates from higher water layers according to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues were now investigated 28 Greenland, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long while the biggest 502 centimetres size.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyze the lens core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is already before the birth of the sharks which the proteins contained therein will not be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, its birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, as a nuclear tests on major amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">At 220 centimeters of the length of the third smallest animal, the lens core of carbon-14 contained a low surplus of carbon-14, which is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland haves in their lens core to normal carbon-14 amounts, which occurs by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 o'clock for a 493 centimeters long Greenland shark, at the age of 335, while the record shark is even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Greenland-females just got up again, when they are longer than four metres, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers could be assigned to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters, probably on the threshold of the sexually mature and its age with 156 years has been determined, Greenland with a majority of at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is likely to be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalories live mainly in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the old record holder, a 211 years old Greenland, whose speck is on neck a 120 year old resin tip, was captured before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to its low temperatures, the organism of the living-living animals often runs on savings.</seg>
<seg id="36">So you realize later - and alder slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals often are often large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, by which the animal heat does.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal is so dangerous, and should focus on it as early as possible as many generations," "" "explains the evolution of the evolution of the evolution." ""</seg>

<seg id="8">Hoys retirement brings a gap to close the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man when they stayed, when they saw the potential in the villi, which now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">In front of four years ago, Kenny won a Olympic team in front of four years, but in the Qualification Round, the New Zealand won the New Zealand in the first round.</seg>

<seg id="27">If the barometer of our progress has been in the last five months, we expect a successful five days in the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kennys, it is possible in the field of possible that he repeated Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations were driven for Rio.</seg>

<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thickener and larger, it was therefore not good in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was quite knock.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was at the beginning eight Megabytes, which would suffice today for approximately two selector with high resolution.</seg>

<seg id="11">20 years ago, the Communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer Fair Cebit in Hanover as "office in the western bottle format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone was able to receive a lot: SMS and e-mails were sent and received, also by fax was the Communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to websites was possible via HTML browsers, even if quintently slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and a electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone couldn't be opened as a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then a small keyboard and a black-white screen took place.</seg>
<seg id="18">Quite proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, which is about 1400 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of smartphones in Germany was Euro 392 in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could have been in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">The clusion phones are a success story, if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The mobile phone card of the Finns experienced an exceptional disaster, was finally sold on Microsoft and handled by Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, the market rule today, all of them were much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Always and everywhere online, this is today for very many people daily.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">Sold, approximately 1.4 billion devices were sold on Samsung and Apple, including 555 million units alone.</seg>
<seg id="28">Worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">The well-running business of the countless app suppliers and the telecommunication concert are coming.</seg>
<seg id="30">Around the smartphone is meanwhile a whole industry developed.</seg>
<seg id="31">The decisive breakthrough came to the mass market at the beginning of 2007, the Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhones at the end of 2007.</seg>
<seg id="32">He asked three units in one: a music player, a telephone and a Internet communication, all via touch screen easy to operate.</seg>
<seg id="33">The winning train from Apple began, today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who ruled the market for the market.</seg>
<seg id="35">Finally, you finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Sages now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.</seg>
<seg id="37">The smartphone is 20 years after the invention a self-understanding.</seg>
<seg id="38">On average, each Germans have meanwhile 88 times a day on his mobile phone.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably inhabitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model probably inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to detect the past the Venus based on tools and algorithms that resembles those of climatic research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could be contested with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists previously informed that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the most recent simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin-like atmosphere and yet slowly reversed.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model lit also the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet thought to be more dry than the earth, but had once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and incarving faster evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow revolution of Venus was almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warmed the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer clouds, which works as a rainbow to paragliding the surface from most of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously thought of Planetarium research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably habitable, Venus was exposed to Venus in the course of several billion years --too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their ocean evaporated and its water vapor was burned from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen, there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today.</seg>

<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their depressor software according to the observations of Malwarebooks to attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential soldering money falls significantly higher than for private use.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we observe a scraping fast evolution of damage software," "" "Malwarebooks-CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "World" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the Malwareprograms have been designed to send advertisements.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then discovered the perpetrator software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only in the past few months, private use the target, but the change took place in the past months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware is working after a simple pattern: once on the computer of an Opens, she searches after unlong changed files such as WordPress, Excel- or database files, as well as archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files are encrypted with Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainable.</seg>
<seg id="14">Afterwards, the software presents the demands of the pressurfers.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to receive the turnkey code to the files, the victims must provide money - mostly in the form of the crypt bitcoin -.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private use the personal photo database on the game, it goes to companies with sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage dropped out if a Ransomware falls.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent had to complete the business activities even when people were living in habitations.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany there were already several hospitals in attacks, whose patients can be threatened by loss of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we say the victims," "" "pays not, you only promotes the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies have to pay their data.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to refuse to reject the requirement of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker turn again and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a current study, the security forter of F-Secure examines the usage surfaces and contact with the pressurprises and come to the result: the perpetrators attempt to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You explain your victims by chat, as they can pay by bitcoin, freely accessible support sites or decrypt for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And they will be saved to payments of a few hundred euros, companies must be part of hard, and five-digit sums to repay their data.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potential high and relatively risk gains from the Ransomware detection, the hacker will always share professional and share their work, explains safety examination Chester Oniewski by antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a Ransomware circa within one week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more likely to be more than three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmer sell their damage software then in the form of a software construction to the actual compression.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits produced by malware, advice and additional tools for one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10.000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "delivery includes a customization, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed" "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The presets are then looking for further chipper to spread the freshly bought software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So in one of the forums, one of the forums bought the set of a crime and commissioned one further to install the software on as many PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per final calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the crime then spammer on dissemination with dissemination," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known to provide their data better by many companies.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies-IT-persons employed in the Malwarebooks survey confidence to trust Ransomware by file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is no adequate threat, the perpetrators instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or quotation," explains Malwarebooks-CEO Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is the claim of damage according to type of data by a multiple bit higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things on the grain.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the hackerconference defcon demonstrated security forscher, as they were able to receive thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of a derart blocks could be quite a ransom benefit.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrator then instead of heating in the future a whole production street in a factory could block Ransomware also in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, you wake up forever, at night you arrive at night, in the morning it is no more thinking about sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">At least one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, approximately one quarter of adult sleep disturbances and more than ten percent can find their sleep frequently or permanently relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How external problems or sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of insomnia, and it can be destroyed by them diverse causes, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for inductors and sleeping medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">Whatever you understand, however, the Insomnie, so it is an input and asleep.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just the passage can be found many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the German house association with practice in Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disturbances are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind, organic, mental or behavioral factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not rare, the sleeping disturbing of a different condition.</seg>

<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors have one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who, for example, has a bandage, can be badly lying, wakes every two to three hours and starts to greedy about everyday problems and take care of greedy, there is no such an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">That leads to tension, and sleep is not possible anymore.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should one sleep with sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep for a period of one month in at least three nights per week, should be impaired, should go to a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look very different: one is beaten, tired, undisturbed, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is slightly delightful, mood fluctuations or physical complaints like magnets or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to lint the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options are among other behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or other medicines - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">It hardly exists in Germany in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fixed, Head of the Interdisciplinary Research Center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why you should first contact with sleeping difficulties at home, avenging weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should come into the sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For investigation in the sleeping laboratory, medical equipment for instance with respirators, with disease-tiredness, when sleeping, or if you don't find the cause of a passage disturbance, Fibre.</seg>
<seg id="27">We do not need to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please make no lunch break," says Fixed.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the shortened you enter into the bed for its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Beside the electrodes the body you bear a nasal glasses, a chest strap and a fenders on fingers.</seg>

<seg id="24">A reason for that not all neighbors could see the problem that they are not necessarily affected by the crime: offences such as body injuries, statistics are estimated that almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the criminal offences make non-damage arising from the newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, which has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 years, no speech can be given by uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "what violence goes, it is advisable: the people in the 94 are their neighbors who are not intended." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars will also give it right in the Rigid already longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For those studied architectin is their road no crime focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives along the street and get more one another, then somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously drawn into the Rigid street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore it was so important that the residents receive their road: from the police, politics and the media, who claimed the Deutiliarch over the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of inhabitants like Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: by splayeless newbuildings in former building gaps that the old residents remains.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "we are finally the condominiums, which are not interesting for many, - here are rather people who are not so well done" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction may I not be guarded."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone listening to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is also a frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For Zuerzoic, who like more about colour bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiev.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who's going, should be aware of his - exactly like someone who moves into a bar-quarter, so bad about noise can be harder.</seg>
<seg id="39">All only with the names of presented persons have asked to be called, not with their right name</seg>

<seg id="3">In addition she is a social worker.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee contractor for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogy is supporting the team of administration around Achim Grow berger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees itself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, workers in refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else is mismixed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client of the working group indicates that the volunteer are grateful more than thankful that Deuterle is now, the eiving Wollstsau, especially a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, some - less spells than rather to the multitude of wishing tasks are targeted - common, when administration wanted to write the site.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-term experience in the field of social work, a jealous Wollchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, Annika Deule.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "especially we go for organization, work with people on site and also behind the scenes and network activity." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been present for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent stake to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was the highest time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuterle Honor and hauptian actors supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A heaviest problem has been found since some time to find flats for the connecting-fleets that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The communes are responsible for the connection of the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the communes itself.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Council to the municipality and the job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not any owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search have been a very difficult since some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto finds the administration of no private dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far it did not work, unless you want to have private dwellings, Deuterle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, non-common dwellings must be notorious, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are placed in the Wasenstrasse.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments are not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, are Regine customer and Annika Deuterle.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, there are trainees, training courses, school places, one-euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who need to be folded or arranged.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many works in the building yard or help home-care, non-profit work - and the motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reported.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive impact effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy".</seg>
<seg id="35">Activity, but not only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, saying Deuterle and Customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a courageous feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it offers offers such as sport, contacts with locals and in particular language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here administration and honours.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "it is centrally located that the refugees get the feeling they are in Germany and welcome." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain the refugees that it lasts, and they can sense it to time, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who sometime the feeling of development, he could not work in Urbach, thirst, do not work and be unprofitable, who will never integrate it.</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority be motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "problem cases, however, is the honest," "" "people, in which nothing goes." "" "the work of Deuterle and client is therefore always motivating others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">All these have been a "Mammutess" job. "</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two after the youngest incidents in front of radicalization, also in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine's customer clearly," "" "what lack of naiv call" "". "" "" "a residual risk could be" "" "but would not exclude it." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensibilites are the helper already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also topic with refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They had the fear that the assassination attempt in call it completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "you want to show that they don't have nothing to do," "" "says Regine's customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So we need to keep main and honestations on site and in the region of activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background, that soon a new stores of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to set her helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"we haven't arrived in Urbach, where we would like," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher has also been used to integrate the existing human beings.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 persons, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in trouble you are helping them, both women are involved.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no easy answers.</seg>
