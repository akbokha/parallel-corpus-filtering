the relation between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
both we wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as T@@ ehr@@ an dest@@ abil@@ ising activities in the Middle East .
the meeting should also be around the conflict with the Palestinians and the projected two @-@ States @-@ solution .
the relation between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been cl@@ amped for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the continuously urban development of Israel and publicly off Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of peace with peace process .
the deal sub@@ due to the Iranian nuclear programme now deteri@@ or@@ ated by Barack Obama &apos;s nuclear programme .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had a controversi@@ al speech in the Republi@@ can Congress in front of the US Congress which was partly inv@@ oked by Obama , as an aff@@ r@@ ont to Obama .
the address was not spoken to Obama , but had a meeting in Israel with regard to the upcoming elections in Israel .
in a call pursu@@ es professor to shot his gir@@ l@@ friend
in a emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb declared with a somewhat later voice of the police , so that he shot his gir@@ l@@ friend and would have to come to his house .
Lamb has it important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; is still alive and probably she was , and he said that the family @-@ contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house , officers of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a handwritten note made by Amy Smith . I &apos;m sorry , I couldn &apos;t feel it but I loved it . &quot; this was the only woman who loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter and it was signed by Lamb .
there was no evidence that Lamb who had travelled into two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , and had travelled back 300 miles to the school premises , where he was killed and killed by a popular course professor , E@@ than Schmidt and at the door to his office .
Delta State University of police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford spoken that university staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 pm .
he said that it did not shoot the real not@@ ation sometime afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : he took the life when the police stopped .
one day after the shooting in the university , students and fac@@ tions to hide herself behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to get a picture of it , later being motiv@@ ated .
the details conducted by investig@@ ators on both the borders of the state , including what students and employees who didn &apos;t know him , helped us to draw an image of a talented , but perhaps difficult teacher .
students said that they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in the auti@@ er , where Pr@@ un@@ ite died , he said , he did not have a history of violence or a criminal record .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt itself first mentioned in a book in which he mentioned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which he divided his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both were in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose structures included 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were some read@@ ings to be problem@@ atic behaviour .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ gone , added to the Lamb , saying that he also appeared a little nervous and wor@@ ried , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said the Lamb didn &apos;t tell him that he had done deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb earlier record the Delta State University for failure of health reasons , and said that he had any health problem .
in this year he taught only two online courses .
the university &apos;s newest changes in employment policy has significant that the Promotion entered the Lamb so hard , for him no guarantee for an automatic way to be regarded as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; university president William La@@ For@@ ge said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he know nothing out of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something at Mr Lam@@ ber &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that have no answer anymore .
after arriving from the Campus the police later found the police later , when he was moved to Mississippi from Ar@@ kan@@ sas .
before he could be arrested , later mis@@ chief of a .@@ 38 Kali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &quot; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ on@@ ysi@@ el Johnson .
his car ran into the dri@@ v@@ eway .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb didn &apos;t go to this house but Johnson said that she knew that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb kept out in the year .
Lamb has launched the work in 2009 , even 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants , under@@ took ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he wrote his doctorate in the spring in education .
one of the long@@ time saved ker@@ bs det@@ ects it as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and fun .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston , she said she was 15 and the lamb , was 20 when they met their alliance .
they and their friends were in high school , and he was the cool firstborn guy , who tried to teach the guitar play .
He was the black and white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all girls melt when he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 , and in Jackson city of Bran@@ don . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss have come together out some time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who was only living with them in the brick @-@ house , bor@@ dering on a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was in order .
the former husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends who had remained and had a daughter who now had 19 years old .
&quot; it was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he has never met late , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played .
Lamb hit W@@ ash , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared in the years three years ago .
later they played together one or other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a nurse who worked for various businesses .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak up bar close by G@@ auti@@ er , said he Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ ele Night went out later for the last time to finish his guitar and harmon@@ ic audience prior to a bad audience .
there weren &apos;t any indications in this , that anything is not agreed .
&quot; simply just a happy pair , &quot; he said .
we stayed at the evacu@@ ation and paid together .
I mean , they both had a good sense for Silhouette .
Schmidt , the deaf teacher , led the first semester programme and speci@@ alis@@ es in American U@@ ne@@ cks and colonial history , said Don Giovanni Mitchell , an English teacher at the school .

8 Change values that indicate that Donald Tr@@ ump is going to catch .
some have tried to check it as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but anyway , how some lic@@ ans try to avoid Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper push in the question down@@ wards , it doesn &apos;t work ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in a double @-@ digit range , and some begin to inquire about what it means for the opportunities of nom@@ ination of the real estate business .
of course , it is too early in the elec@@ toral term .
none claims that Tr@@ ump probably will win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts bet@@ ting that this time with Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s guidance on the Asc@@ ent Herman Cain was living in 2011 , of which nobody was involved with a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have strug@@ gling to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ze@@ able groups such as Je@@ b Bus hs @-@ Super P@@ AC and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now acknowledge their most restri@@ c@@ ess power and start to run their dollar .
here are some current traffic values which indicate that the real estate business @-@ Mog@@ ul are not only a temporary basis :
Tr@@ umps is most popular and have turned around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University announced that only two of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans see the real estate in Mog@@ ul .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
in early August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
these figures are in early states .
quin@@ id@@ pi@@ ac &apos;s vote in I@@ owa has found that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good idea of Tr@@ ump .
2 @-@ thirds of GO@@ P @-@ elec@@ tor Car@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump @-@ candidates .
in a 1998 survey of CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , they would be either &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump sum had been nominated .
only two of them would say they are stra@@ ined , &quot; when he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent , they would &quot; strongly advise &quot; vs. 40 percent , which will say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the nearest in enthusiasm ?
Marco Rub@@ io is only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; being off@@ ended &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the One E@@ stabl@@ ishment was the candidate .
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans see about ink@@ jet temper@@ ament as problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is comp@@ elled for his or mis@@ er@@ ating statements , 52 per cent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the Muslim voters think that the real estate there is the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first pre@@ st@@ enti@@ to State nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 per cent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think he holds the personality for a Commander in Chief , according to Quin@@ cer@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent do that he did not have the personality to perform effectively complete function , and almost six of 10 independent , his temper@@ ament does not work into the White House P@@ asse , ABC / Post .
question@@ ing sel@@ ector activ@@ ates the idea .
if you do not expos@@ e their money , republi@@ can elec@@ tor keep Tr@@ ump to work in real .
if they are question@@ ed who won the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , 2007 will say , according to a survey of CNN / OR@@ C , four of ten claims that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
it is a change since the time when four of the ten end of July their money changed to Je@@ b Bush .
full revel@@ ations : GO@@ P elec@@ tors in the past had not been the most important crystal ball .
at that time in the final cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans that Rick Perry will win the nom@@ ination that win only 28 % of the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a wide range of GO@@ P @-@ voters can create cro@@ c campaign as pl@@ au@@ si@@ ble .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered about another candidate , Tr@@ ump still strikes almost any candidate .
some experts reck@@ on that the split @-@ spl@@ itter field probably con@@ gen@@ dered to Tr@@ umps Time , while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump Support must have spread to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a review of the Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump die the majority aid .
he traveled before Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points , before Marco Rub@@ io 14 points ahead of Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before her Rand Paul , John Kas@@ im and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a narrow majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans states that they have formed their opinion .
a new pol@@ l conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday is that only a little more than half of voters being supported by the voters say that they have assigned their voices .
of course , much has happened to change that , and nobody can really say that , never change the opinion .
46 percent said they leave open the door to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ umps is the most powerful competition in the moment of Neuro@@ sur@@ geon , Ben Car@@ son , but voters say that they have formed their opinion , are twice as frequent to Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they are not equal to pl@@ ump on immigration .
ever since Donald Tr@@ ump in his elec@@ toral campaign was &quot; rape in Mexico &quot; by Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign , was the Im@@ migration Turn and a fishing point of the public dis@@ course in 2016 .
some are concerned that the Bom@@ bast@@ ic Ex@@ pres@@ sions of Tr@@ ump Sig@@ is@@ ano @-@ Americans are remote @-@ maintained by the Republi@@ can Party and damage the new care@@ fulness efforts .
however , according to the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they deal with Tr@@ ump in questions of migration .
so long as the Im@@ migration remains in the lim@@ el@@ ight , Donald Tr@@ ump is to act as well .
the fru@@ str@@ ation over the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
by Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , however , around half the support of Republi@@ can elec@@ tors in Colombia is especially due to their out@@ si@@ ders .
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Monday @-@ survey by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ patient as someone with government experience .
and they too is ra@@ ged in Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Registration / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa 2 weeks ago indicates that three out of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans were fru@@ str@@ ated in Congress with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent .
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential American
here in Hob@@ bies , the most expensive community - overlooking the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of a roof@@ ed hospital is worth 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects in nature is limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the study - hence the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special situations is one square meter most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ d in Munich are not really little .
contrary to Germany &apos;s top apartment buildings , the price would be such as Pe@@ an@@ uts .

two numbers of go@@ al@@ sc@@ orer in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .

those who smo@@ kes , has higher risk to lose teeth
those who smo@@ kes , doesn &apos;t make the l@@ ungs , but also the teeth , like a Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study hand @-@ dated .
good news : for rent the risk falls rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a meas@@ ly elevated risk to lose their teeth in early .
this goes for a long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking people , there was no risk to lose their teeth during the period in order to lose the 2.5 to 3.6 gig@@ abytes .
the researchers were observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes of loss of teeth , car@@ ies and inflamm@@ ations of the g@@ um , re@@ iter@@ ates the DI@@ BA@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is quit smoking a risk factor , emphas@@ ize the authors .
this connection between smoking and timing loss therefore return to frequent fl@@ esh@@ ly inflamm@@ ations in smo@@ kers .
not to be clari@@ fied , in what extent , smoking is also increased the risk of car@@ ies .
people who list@@ ened to smoking could reduce their risk by a short time but write the researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the haz@@ ard origins back to the level of non @-@ smoking accommodation , &quot; First or Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; let people see it if they are non @-@ smoking , study director H@@ einer Boeing vom DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quit the life time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not to smoke is well suited to l@@ ungs and vessels and leads to high quality health and to high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population , aged 65 @-@ 74 , have been contrac@@ ted by pay@@ load , and this has divided the DI@@ A@@ E .
earlier , scientists had pointed out that smoking should increase the risk of early teeth less .
the new long @-@ term study gives details of the findings .

EU Commission proposes in fight against TT@@ IP
the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system to fall over the planned Trans@@ atl@@ antic Free Trade Agreement ( TT@@ IP ) .
the controversi@@ al private safety equipment for disputes between companies and countries are expected to be replaced by a transparent system which is clearly more traditional with its functionality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set a system to set up the citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sister established a proposal to negoti@@ ate a negoti@@ ating position with the US for a European negoti@@ ating position .
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP aims to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans regarding the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings shall see that the EU states and the United States shall select two independent judges for a new service in the United States .
the aim is to come to equal parts from the EU , the USA and the third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to collect up against judgments .
so far , the rules of arbit@@ rators increased one of the arbit@@ rators , as many as against their sentences there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent months of the past months , it clearly revealed that citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; give effect to the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term you want to work to an International Investment Tribunal .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries might be clari@@ fied .
the performance of major companies demanded by the investor @-@ State arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) in particular should be considered to be one of the major reasons for major resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .

Jeremy the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ ction of the Prime Minister
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns has been made at the Prime Minister &apos;s president with tension
the new Labour Party Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n is intended to give his dé@@ but in the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ ction and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n will rise , in order to present the first of its six pre@@ paid issues , shortly after noon , its performance is probably studied by the media representatives from the vicinity .
he requested &quot; fewer theater and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could sk@@ ip some sessions to sk@@ ip them .
the meeting is being raised by the first parliamentary procedure for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , since she was appointed member of the V@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ viol@@ inist and his speech at the Tu@@ c Conference on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour Party , on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them at a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of Battle of Britain had emerged in silence , cr@@ iti@@ que of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MP@@ S prov@@ okes and represents on the center of several title @-@ pages stories in the newspapers .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ ns decision , not the national hy@@ m@@ ne , has attention drawn attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respec@@ ting silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he had accepted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her@@ o@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in an air battle for England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ atten@@ u@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour Party who were to sing the Labour Party , &quot; ir@@ respective of his faith that the mon@@ archy would be abolished .
almost a dozen of sh@@ adows &apos;s ministers have refused to serve as Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team and calls them to differences in business , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party were originally supported as leaders .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t reported that political differences are also dropped in the Labour Standards and Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns outlined on the European Union position and the limit in win@@ nings under Mr Robin Bran@@ t .
Mr Cor@@ bi@@ n said the Tu@@ c conference that Labour MEP to Labour to put out the whole idea of a con@@ stra@@ int .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and inst@@ ig@@ ator of the Party , said that the party is &quot; very clear , &quot; that they only be lower against the government plans , to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth year &apos;s leader , David Cameron &apos;s T@@ ory b@@ oss who has since turned T@@ ory CEO in the last decade on the D@@ isp@@ atch Box in parliament .
the Labour Party , who has promised to support other polit@@ ician , says that he had &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions .
Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Group &apos;s fra@@ ction of the Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ ally and that he is made with both &quot; perc@@ us@@ ability and the Stre@@ ets with resi@@ stances . instead , it has serious problems like poverty , in@@ equality , and challenges to focus on young people .
M@@ R Cor@@ bit@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the sh@@ adows of economic secretary , is also present if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea to the interview , that other colleagues are likely to take the word , and that he spoke John Ber@@ man , spokesperson for the lower house , to distur@@ bed the problem .
when he was born in 2005 , Mr Cameron announced that he is made up of politics in the style of a &quot; Cas@@ per@@ le theater &quot; which often worked with the &quot; re @-@ round of the Prime Minister . &quot; but a few years later he dre@@ amed that he failed .
as she was broadcast on television in 1990 , the fra@@ ction was considered by the Prime Minister and his leadership in the house and his position among its parliamentary court , though critics have argu@@ ed , that they have already been car@@ ic@@ atured and require further reforms .

Met@@ dra launches the Ac@@ ad@@ mis@@ sal Camp@@ a@@ ign to Fight Al@@ di@@ - Im@@ prove
Met@@ dock is trying to protect the IG@@ A branches in front of an Al@@ di @-@ invasion of South Australia and Western Australia .
food starting wholes@@ al@@ ers has launched a campaign of So@@ in@@ dig@@ nity campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ al@@ mine invasion .
at Al@@ di , the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia were prepared early next year , Str@@ asser and IG@@ A stores their relationships with local food suppliers , and marketing the brand IG@@ A through the ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am marketing and marketing of the soci@@ etal media , as well as events such as Adelaide Show .
IG@@ A retailers and supplier are coming aboard , with brands such as E@@ ish@@ te Simm@@ o from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , who sell snacks and shop @-@ owned companies that sell tickets for the South Australian soccer league to tre@@ ad customers .
it is expected that if doing further details of his defense strategy are released on 29 September when the wholes@@ al@@ ers are under@@ going through food , alcohol and equipment through their annual investors &apos; strategy .
there is a lot at the game , since South Australia and Western Australia , almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A @-@ l@@ ash@@ can represent and higher profit margin than met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the Eastern states .
shop@@ pers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ep@@ tically par@@ ag@@ ell and IG@@ A retailers have a much more powerful market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in Western Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in Eastern Australia .
however , anal@@ ysts do such as Morgan Stanley , that Al@@ di takes twelve months after opening its first markets , taking care of around five percent of the food market in these two countries . however , mainly self @-@ independent individual tra@@ ders will take away .
according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley is estimated that IG@@ A retailers can spend a $ 360 million revenue per year and in cash from $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on ass@@ umption that Al@@ di opens its offices in the next year 25 branches in SA , and 30 million in WA , and generate revenue of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and gro@@ c@@ ers and on @-@ scale a high fixation cost of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s could be transferred about 13 million $ pre @-@ tax profit before interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ assi@@ c shares in the Eastern states , mainly on Al@@ di and Col@@ es , though a recent survey was out by Roy Morgan found out that IG@@ A @-@ purchases came out .
Morgan Stanley assumes that metal will drop on food and grocery by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and by 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told that in a business may come in Melbourne , that Met@@ rics will disappear within a decade .
Met@@ eren encourage you to react public to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ rics will be raised Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As market share has gone down from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade ; it fell by 43 percent since 2012 , down@@ ward investment in operating pressure on sales and mar@@ gins .
the wholes@@ al@@ ers are but investing more than $ 150 million , to increase sales prices of Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week , and IG@@ A retailers in order to improve fresh foods and improve a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the prices adap@@ tations and loading @-@ pl@@ ating software will be hop@@ ed for the first time in 2017 , which will return to profit growth for the first time in four years .
Than@@ x Kok@@ k@@ is is supported by the president of Australian tennis courts Steve Heal@@ y
than@@ asi con@@ co@@ in@@ is deser@@ ves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ x Kok@@ k@@ is was one of the &quot; collabor@@ ative damage &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Lac@@ gios and earns his opinion about the President of the Australian tennis board Steve Heal@@ y as criticism for his own behavior .
co@@ ca@@ kin@@ is , the younger son of the talented Du@@ os , vo@@ iced up again as &quot; Special KS &quot; , fought from the rum@@ our of Kyr@@ ill with St@@ an WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters .
in a hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e quali@@ fier in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , shortly afterwards , co@@ ca@@ kin@@ is and his opponent shows Harrison twice by the arbit@@ rators . &quot; WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA the her@@ pes have to be beaten , and I should beat the child . &quot;
during he was last seen , as he had a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp had pulled a potential U.S. open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended from Heal@@ y .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam K@@ oth in order to take second place at the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ finals against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a matter over which I really en@@ e@@ ased me is the fact that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; looked forward a little into the battle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heal@@ y did . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a bat , when he lost a bat in the US Open , but he is not the first player who started pun@@ ish a ra@@ cket with himself , and I know Tan@@ zio a good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he really worked in the US Open extremely well , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances on Harrison and so much , and I think it deser@@ ves much recognition .
he has a great team around itself , he did a great family around itself , and I believe that he was a little too strictly .
he is a very big 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on he has never tast@@ ed a problem with other players , he is trained in the shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deser@@ ves it to be judged by his own mer@@ it .
Heal@@ y also supported the decision to do not consider the decision makers that are taking place on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for all but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return an long @-@ term component into the team .
&quot; first we wish that the team will be completely focused on competition and didn &apos;t all around the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; der &apos;s &#93; , &quot; Heal@@ y said Heal@@ y .
and I believe that Nick meets very quickly the way , wor@@ ship@@ ed people like fe@@ athers and Mur@@ ray , and deser@@ ves all the cr@@ iti@@ que , in which he can only think of what continued this day , in which he can only think about it , and it is best for the team and it is best for him .
Europe refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back home
Hungary explains the not@@ e@@ situation and bol@@ ted the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held every party that tried to come into the country . all with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .

( Serbia ) I want to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ision .
we will have take place in the next few days with Brussels and other countries , &quot; said Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague .
the tur@@ mo@@ il at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came to agree on a day after the 28 @-@ nations blo@@ c at a strict meeting in Brussels .
however , the ministers agreed to divide the responsibility for 40,000 people who were fled to Italy and Greece . supp@@ ressed their hope that ultimately , the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would mean that the EU Member would continue maintaining 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
on Tuesday , Angela Merkel and Austria claimed a special summit on the European Union to discuss the immigration period .
Hungary : however , Hungary had not hope in the action of Brussels or from its neigh@@ bors .
the emergency number on Tuesday in two southern regions were accord@@ ed to authority to regul@@ ate the crisis , so that they could accelerate the streets and asylum procedures .
the Hungarian foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country took the construction of a por@@ cup@@ board wire along its border with Romania , in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants in the country - after having completed a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie T &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that in terms of the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence around the G and Serbia were used .
throughout the past months , Hungary has become a lot of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East , to a considerable bott@@ len@@ eck and an in@@ dul@@ ge point in the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , has in@@ si@@ sted that most vulner@@ able economic refugees are in search of a better life , and no war @-@ gli@@ ders who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU @-@ states , including Germany .
the new laws that occurred at midnight in Hungary , continue to cross the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Z@@ a@@ uns , which led the government along the southern border to Serbia . this laws also put higher limitation of liability for human traff@@ ic@@ kers .
&quot; in terms of the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explained the Not@@ ary , &quot; said government driver Z@@ olt@@ an K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still under@@ take place on the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but Rep@@ ter of Associated Press are reported on the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security adviser for Or@@ ban , said the authorities recommended 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country .
they are coming over by having damage the fence , they are now in police custody and accused of off@@ ences of off@@ ences after the new laws .
authorities are up to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials concluded two of the seven border operations in Serbia , after a train stop using bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos converted the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of people , and a crowd is pressed close there .
about 20 escaped successfully , but thousands remained outside .

the former US Secretary of Hill@@ ary Clinton keeps fighting a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race around the nom@@ ination on national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders won their stake against the floor .
Clinton has now supported the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders is on the second position , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who did not report whether he was elected President of the presidential elec@@ torate , receives support for 15 percent of the elec@@ toral votes .
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is fixed what candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ ics Supp@@ orters are competent of the other candidates in their choice .
since the C@@ BS @-@ news survey , Clinton has lost some win@@ nings at a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders scored some profits .
Clinton keeps a large head over women and moder@@ ates , but such ar@@ ches have decreased .
their support for men has decreased significantly , and S@@ anders is within here only with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s benefit with democratic voters under 50 years of age has been vol@@ at@@ ile , and they are now at the same height .
however , Clinton has even a huge lead over the older voters .
last month Clinton flew into another with double @-@ digit lead in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders had a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the parliamentary elections in the country &apos;s elections claim that they would strongly support Clinton , when it was nominated by the Party .
a quarter would support them with some pre@@ ferences and 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons of current supp@@ orters are especially fascin@@ ated by her .
the views are stronger in those who don &apos;t support Clinton - just about a quarter would support them .
during 48 percent of the elec@@ tor &apos;s elec@@ toral elections , such as Clinton has stressed the fact that , say , less Republi@@ can elec@@ tors say this about their leading candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clin@@ ique supp@@ orter responded to an open question , why they want , that she has the can@@ did@@ acy , is the most common reply ( 16 percent ) , followed by the fact that it is time that a woman will be president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best can@@ did@@ acy for the job ( 10 percent ) .
a Clinton &apos;s supp@@ orter &apos;s connection is also mentioned in Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) by Clinton &apos;s Clinton .
consent to deal with the problems and voters are also cited .
since the vice president is Vice President of the Presidency &apos;s elected President , 57 per cent of democratic voters want him in the race - although one third believe it should not do it .
where democratic voters will be asked for the party , who would be the second choice for the party , bi@@ ds at the top .
by Clinton &apos;s contra@@ dictions prove more than half that Bi@@ den would have had the second choice far before S@@ anders .
decides , bi@@ ds does not decide to cause the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats that Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead to S@@ anders , of 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters are stressed as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has fallen from 78 percent in the last month .
Bi@@ den obviously requires a second in this measurement , but the percentage that has the &quot; selectable &quot; value has risen .
however , at the question of what is more important for the candidates , Democratic Vot@@ ers call for the voters .
similarly as in the last month , no longer Democratic candidate or potential candidate for this sel@@ ector is still un@@ acceptable for that elections .
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates give good results with some important features in the sel@@ ections of the party &apos;s pres@@ election .
added to overview , Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den are tru@@ thful and tru@@ st@@ worthy and rich with strong har@@ sh qualities .
Bi@@ den gained the best in the three candidates at the best starting point for Clin@@ t &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters think that Clinton is hon@@ est@@ ly and trusted , twice as many say the above S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have the opinion of him .
Democratic Vot@@ ers ( elections for general election ) will also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den , according to their views .
in all these measurements , a quarter of the democratic voters do not have the opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions concerning Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and one Server while the mandate , most of the Democratic Vot@@ ers ( elections are still being satisfied with their declaration of matter and say that it did not affect its opinions .
but it is a different history in the American public .
half of the Americans is not satisfied with their explanation while only a third is satisfied .
the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the E @-@ Mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general opinions about Clinton , in spite of 36 percent said their mind would have seriously deteri@@ or@@ ated .
there are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views are worse in Clinton .
although Clinton is considered to be hon@@ est@@ ly and tru@@ st@@ worthy of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters , just 32 percent see as tru@@ thful and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote is not worthy of sin@@ c@@ ere and tru@@ st@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled shareholders also see Tr@@ ump , not tru@@ thful and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump did not receive good notes by guiding .
of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush were best arranged in hon@@ esty .
a majority of different looks more hon@@ est , but as in Car@@ son many no opinion of him .

but Car@@ son shot at the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well toler@@ ated in demo@@ graphic groups and as@@ unk@@ bed Tr@@ ump under Republi@@ can elec@@ tors in higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Kas@@ im , retired with Wis@@ con@@ sins , Scott Walker , who fell at the deep@@ est part , and indeed from 10 % in the last month to now 2 % .
the former Florida @-@ Governor Je@@ b Bush , the former Governor of Ar@@ kan@@ sas , Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Rub@@ io are located at 6 % on third place .
the error margin under the sample of 376 people of Republi@@ can voters in the latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest term CNN / OR@@ C survey , last week released , shows that Car@@ son coming in circulation , while 19 % support in the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed scar@@ ce clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
with a view to the last week , Car@@ son found some side steps for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geon , even after Car@@ son spent his exc@@ itation to ask f@@ aux @-@ faith in question .

five members of the Brotherhood , with the death of a Bar@@ uch Campus @-@ Neu@@ com@@ ings
nearly two years after a student during a sc@@ r@@ arian rit@@ u@@ als of a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , killing was filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PSI @-@ bro@@ therhood was held in September 2013 by putting his transport into hospital , leading to his death , the police informed the police .
polit@@ ically said , He was loaded with blin@@ d@@ ding eyes , with a 30 pound back@@ pack filled with sand and repeatedly had been attacked , while trying to agree on a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained of head@@ aches , then he fell in mind .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PSI leaders did not call the emergency number 911 after he became strong and was allegedly an hour before they were born into a hospital , so the Police comes .
they , however , had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s appar@@ el , and wrote his symptoms , including Andy Men@@ g , the National President of the Brotherhood to im@@ min@@ ish Council , said police chief Chris Wagner on a press conference .
&quot; at that point , the members of utensils began to hide and set the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood during Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ sign@@ atory Wagner . &quot;
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died next morning by his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g were repeated with bl@@ amed force bre@@ aches of the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh a whole .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the dioc@@ ese of the Brotherhood . at least one student , at least was a student , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said in a declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and h@@ ub@@ by@@ ists have to become an account ; and this step of authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe handed out an indictment due to mor@@ nings for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indicted for an humanitarian attacks and formation of a criminal organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t only want to make people responsible , but if there is an organization , which - officially or un@@ officially , we will also draw this to an account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wagner said in a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College banned the Brotherhood and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked her affili@@ ation to the local group .
happen if the F@@ ed will increase interest
a interest rate will come , and the house will fall in contrast , ra@@ is@@ ites for bonds , and the economy will lead to a recession .
this we know .
what we do not know is how long will it take before and how long it will happen .
in particular , the economy features only a small guide to the procedure .
a recession followed within just 11 months of the first Zin@@ ss@@ al break and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ vity of the Federal Reserve by raising interest rates is often even if not always , a factor in the same way as the economy and the financial investments are respon@@ ding .
therefore , the U.S. Central Bank therefore reported that investors should not focus on it whenever it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period , which is needed for norm@@ alisation .
in fact , multiple variables are playing a role .
in the end , market participants could notice that the whole exc@@ it@@ ement could possibly be over@@ used for a interest @-@ rate hike .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is being interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; project , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ , , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest to ordinary heights , but still on a low level , to se@@ ism@@ atic shock , that seem to be feared .
however , this does not mean that it will be no effect .
here is a look at historical trends , which might react to some areas of business :
as seen on the market last month , excess of interest rate can make losses for a@@ while .
as soon as the increase gets , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; it seems to be that wealth contracts be ab@@ sent from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which will perhaps reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ bank anal@@ ysts in a recent study suggest@@ ing after interest @-@ rate of the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market is mostly favorable to interest rates - roughly 14 percent - on the way to a interest rate , but rather flat in the 250 days after the interest rate ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , followed by a recent analysis by Bob D@@ oll , chef editor for Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ds to rise later in the increases working cycle , and the return to it begins to decrease .
rec@@ essi@@ vely is a fact of economic life , but interest @-@ rate increases often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is con@@ fron@@ ted with some conditions that previously not given and could accelerate the recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product is close to his lowest point at a interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , count has only twice the nominal growth rate of 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was in 3.6 percent , only a few men will expect this , and expect just 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to Atlanta F@@ ed figures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rate decreases in so frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and cast the question on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it is different &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants have taken up the first year to a interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were on the sitting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week on Thursday .
while many respec@@ ts and econom@@ ists believe , the FO@@ MC was able to appro@@ ve an increase in this sitting , the fut@@ ures trading is only a chance of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study we have taken place all high @-@ quality cycles from 1950 to today in a Super cycle with increasing difficulty in GDP and pre @-@ review was made very fast after the beginning of rest in the shade , &quot; says the report .
by contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the follow @-@ up phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which has been waiting since the last recession which hit the record for 35 months , and so far is 74 months .
the fixed income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , because the market is advert@@ ised with a interest rate , and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that bonds is more faster than in stock , when they change its strategic course .
in bonds , the R@@ end@@ ites can change the direction once the first increase in the cycle is made .
at the end of the Incre@@ asing cycle , the bond issues came instantly , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates do show that yields can be closer together between longer and shorter form of bonds and reduce the curve .
highly interest expenses often bring up even in such a climate that even though &quot; we are still c@@ auti@@ ous to expect higher income , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come @-@ anal@@ ysts at Swan , in an analysis .
it is interesting , he means that the markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the value of the dollar and the decline of inflation , there are some highlights that the market has adjusted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stronger monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in short @-@ term interest , the Re@@ j@@ ur@@ faced will increase , l@@ ending , l@@ ending sp@@ ell has expanded , and the volumes increased - all the market features , when the F@@ ed has tigh@@ tened its strategy .
in a large and whole company , companies covered the larger part of its business operations in the USA . interest rates will benefit from interest rates and local products .
multin@@ ational companies with high debts are worse than a rising dollar of rising purchases on the global market , and as well as financing their debt .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; Quality &quot; shares tend to react , three months after initial interest @-@ rate hike , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs @-@ Anal@@ ysts in a report to the customers .
companies with strong balance sheet companies have higher expectations after each of interest income levels in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 , up by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital rates as well as low volume liquidity during their shares , results of a figure of a figure of 4 percentage points ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a big issue .
company with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
consumers can also benefit from increasing the rise outside of pure shar@@ ehol@@ ding .
econom@@ ically then could see gains from higher income , even if professionals are different opinion , how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says member of the member Andrew B@@ ingham
con@@ serv@@ atives &apos; con@@ serv@@ atives &apos; to present the transmitter because of its &quot; dup@@ lication &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is increasingly not to distinguish from commercial rival .
he also collected the BBC Music Awards and said that she has only been the Br@@ its
parliament @-@ collabor@@ ator Dam@@ ien Me , the show The Voice on and said that this was not so original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns up to Classic FM , asser@@ ts new shock , and increasing new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something doing something the private broadcast@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
con@@ serv@@ atives &apos; Andrew B@@ ingham has also told the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the publicly owned radio station &quot; could only be distinguished by its commercial use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Radio 3 seems - I &apos;m using the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also ranked the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which began last year , seem to be the Br@@ its just under another name .
so , if you try to do something different - this is two spontaneous examples , where you are actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General@@ eck found the alleg@@ ations back and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is far off its commercial out@@ going when it is about live music and enligh@@ ten@@ ment of the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will learn more about classical music .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which really &apos;s un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and assi@@ mil@@ ating the commitment of Radio 3 , new music and new works in order that I really think is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey said that the c@@ ures are working hard to eng@@ age the audience , when it did so in the past , because the British are less well informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of the BBC &apos;s production that took place during the hearing on the selection of culture , media and sport for the fire , which became a commercial rival to the feet .
the T@@ ory Mark Dam@@ ien Collins took The Voice of - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not especially prominent ?
Lord Hall showed that the BBC 1 @-@ show - with Pal@@ oma passages and Boy George as a judge - were produced on a special BBC way .
he added , he would be pleased that the company &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house name , &quot; when it set the next time a entertainment series .
however , he refused to complete the order of further rows of The Voice in the Future or to issue money of the fee for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales grew in August at the most slow@@ est and on the Black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
within the last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the record in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile phone calls
experts believe that the Black Friday p@@ hin@@ dered the issues in November
&quot; &quot; &quot; for over a decade the virtual shopping is bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but some experts say that there is no signs that online sales are stag@@ n@@ ating , after new numbers showed just seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase from the previous year .
experts pre@@ di@@ ct that online sales are stag@@ n@@ ating , after new numbers showed just seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for previous years and go back up to 2000 , then Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ RG St@@ alli@@ sion of the Guardian , said within the course of time . &quot;
he declared that the online sales increased three years ago as the buyer began to help sell their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , for example home on the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now it comm@@ utes a comm@@ end , and we will see that growth will be reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is cited as a reason for the up@@ heav@@ al revenues .
experts believe that buyers will maintain their purchases at this event , which takes place in November the last Friday in November .
last year it turned 5 times the average number of buyers to make their computers to burst your bar@@ gain , and some dealers collap@@ sed .
experts believe that Black Friday could , at which the buyer had fought for bar@@ gain , buyers might be able to buy purchases .
a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium records that from £ 5 spending is a little more than 1 £ online .
in some products like TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases were carried out now via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of men &apos;s clothing and shoes are purchased online rather than in the fashion in interior cities .
Muslims were kidn@@ apping in M@@ ec@@ ca at the crane @-@ accident in M@@ ec@@ ca - Bin Laden family is sanc@@ tion@@ ed
the dead bodies of 29 dead are driven by Muslims in the first insur@@ g@@ ages in M@@ ec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia put down the collapse of the Trans@@ duc@@ dic Bin Laden Group to the load
the Ministry of Health said that overall a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured , since the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered themselves , when 29 of the victims were transported in the streets to bury them , when a crane of M@@ ec@@ ca &apos;s major m@@ yr@@ na fell .
griev@@ ing filled , largely in white dressed in white , the circuit to know its respect , when the first of the dead took their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ eg@@ m cemetery .
in the morning , the fun@@ eral march passed to the Holy Cross , where only days before they ran a building crane by the veil of the mosque and then over@@ threw the tend@@ ency .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for fun@@ eral use when the Saudi King over the building company Am I bin Laden account of the catastrophe , which left 3@@ 94 caused by a penalty .
the bodies of 29 Bet@@ s , which were killed when a crane was over@@ thrown by the Great Central @-@ Central Committee of M@@ ec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , which was one of four children who fell on his first pilgrimage , was collap@@ sed .
M@@ R Ac@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual p@@ addle in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials already announced that add@@ j@@ er goes into M@@ ec@@ ca with thousands of those who continue to go further into the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden &quot; &quot; &quot; , would never have been standing up to the arm of the crane , when he was not used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Arabic version of L@@ g@@ s. published by the state Saudi Press Agency determined that the Bin Laden group is responsible for the crash .
the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency reported in detail that this detail was not said to be out@@ law@@ ed to the management of the company .
at the beginning of this week we had to un@@ veil what the fall of the crane was collap@@ sed which j@@ ump@@ ed into a courtyard of the large mo@@ Base , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims defeated in front of H@@ add@@ enda , which later takes place in this month .
the speaking bin Laden has published no statements about the collapse of the crane and their representatives were not available for a position .
the Royal Decree also re@@ acted the group because of not current security measures , because they did not have surgery with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of Kr@@ ays have been sur@@ round along the sho@@ cks of M@@ ec@@ ca as part of the massive construction which is led by the Bin Laden group .
the speaking collabor@@ ator Bin Laden has been connected to the domain of Saudi Arabia for decades and become over bigger building projects .
the de@@ ceased leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a back@@ sliding son who was s@@ j@@ ailed by the family in the 1990s .
the crash of the crane came in amid@@ st the strong winds and rain , just a few days before the date of millions in the Kingdom of Pil@@ gri@@ mage , which is required at least once in the life of each healthy that is possible .
civil servants said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
government representatives shall indicate that 1 million R@@ ial ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) of the members of the slain are to be paid and the same amount of permanent term .

she said it was necessary to set up the growing demo@@ graphic trends that feature more female single households that have more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works as a majority of men in our stores .
we must push it stronger .
generally , half of our customers come from women with 80 percent of decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in the decision process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the fore@@ head of a British in F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 Index , listed also their top team around to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company which has occupied almost 50 percent of the team with women , including management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious choice - multip@@ licity was here an important topic here .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we continue to continue the club or prosp@@ ered ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Super@@ intend@@ ent@@ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the financial am@@ ber &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did not reach our life insurance of life as security with the Bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during commissioning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association has been agreed with the association : you can pay the money free , no debt will be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moreover , corresponding to the corresponding financial and financial backing the payout of the conversion award has been approved until 1991 .
therefore , one more of the damages was cancelled later , since 2003 , when a plus has been paid on the account .
as a flat and not detailed ab@@ dic@@ ation , the former Ob@@ adi@@ es appeared in this background .
accounts and savings of management of both accused , said the second accused .
why re@@ payments does not have been revealed in detail in detail , judge the judge .
the association was not interested in detail for the financial results , but it &apos;s only important for the cancellation of debt , so the answer .
in 2011 , when an investig@@ ator began an investig@@ ational investigation , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was credited to the national accounts .
the accused were lost , declared the accused .
this securities account won in the name of the second accused and was not known according to this statement .
&quot; why ? &quot; he wanted to know the judge .
the question was asked for a long answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he then said that this was the best for the club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if something happened , no one would have known anything of that money , the prosecutor dropped in the room .
the accused , had previously been informed , just@@ i@@ fies the functional .
this transfer was formulated like the &quot; claim &quot; claim . &quot;
why dem@@ nity opinions ? , refused to judge and vic@@ tor@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first accused began to agree with this formulation , because the association was never suffered a damage &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all of you from Schneider . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do I have a right respon@@ dent ? , &quot; he asked .
in addition , he said that he had never in a cent cont@@ ingent , calcul@@ ating only kilometres money and di@@ ets .
he put an invoice in Di@@ ets the association 1,000 euros per month , the actual effort would have been much higher , he added .
exact documents regarding the def@@ endants were not found in the early years .
they were no longer judged based on an operational test in which everything has been properly declared , declared they declared .
the provisional release was also included .
all author@@ is@@ ations are be made in cash , along with this purpose , he had to carry out persons from his residence to the Bank to Ab@@ burg , in his statement .
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard presents more 30,000 jobs
in addition to the current staff of personnel starting in last three years , the computer lab@@ eller is min@@ ed at the spin off of the company &apos;s further jobs .
the capacity additions to Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) claim is no end .
the US technology group is planning to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 locations in its corporate environment .
thus , costs amounting to about $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) shall have to be saved on Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special load of about € 2.7 billion , which will be generated from the fourth quarter .
the ongoing development of 55@@ ,000 jobs have not been completed for the last three years .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
on stock , Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard celebrated 2.3 percent .
currently , the commercial , printed area of California , California , is currently being bund@@ led in a new company : the computer and printing business is being bund@@ led in a new company - separately from the future areas of computer lab@@ s and data processing for firms as well as other services .
both these companies are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a dis@@ appointing computer sub @-@ section and a weaker demand of corporate customers after his services offered the second largest PC manufacturers to be published in the world today .
in the third quarter of July , the sales of both PC and printers declined by 11.5 percent .
revenue fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion .
the revenue was back in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP answers with a split and massive positions on change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old companies under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has not responded to it so that customers can buy smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and get more business online .
Whit@@ man related activities plans have to see the reduction of around 55@@ .000 places .
conflicts : majority supports the Anti @-@ IS training mission
but if a direct participation of German soldiers on combat operations in Iraq , however , overwhel@@ m@@ ingly contra@@ ven@@ es them , 54 % said they did not agree .
the other countries fly by air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent have been positive .
by contrast , 24 % are in contrast to the conflict .
in cooperation with the Syrian authorities of al @-@ Assad , 51 per cent of respon@@ dents had to say 20 percent would be .
29 percent could not decide .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : assault of Serbian and Serbian fron@@ tier
the Hungarian police operated the Hungarian fighting at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ ash con@@ as and water c@@ ann@@ ons for several hundred migrants .
Eur@@ on@@ ther correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k lived with the violence at the border control point .
he said by phone :
a group of refugees broke out the border .
behind it was formed a polic@@ eman , and behind the polic@@ emen , there was a water ro@@ wer .
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the public .
but the officials initially put the tro@@ t of pep@@ per@@ al .
afterwards the police used Tr@@ ash .
the fur@@ ther@@ ing of Tr@@ ash was gone to refugees .
the Group was dissolved .
the refugees dropped slightly in a time .
an aff@@ ang@@ ere and apparently last woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had met the Tr@@ ash guard , cried out .
other refugees st@@ ills in themselves and suffered under breath@@ es .
the Press Officer of the Serbian police suffered some injuries by the use of liqu@@ e@@ eng@@ as and pep@@ per@@ al spray .
time of Decision about Interest rates on the US @-@ sum database
the world is observed when the U.S. exp@@ on@@ bank is on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest will be raised or not .
a survey of 80 eco @-@ chromos@@ omes were found out that a little more than half , the last week of opinion was found that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will wait no longer , and the interest rates will hold on the current level of 0 - 0.25 per cent .
it is a historical event , because it has been seven years ago to set the F@@ ed interest to NU@@ LL since F@@ ed interest .
&quot; for the first time we approach us to a situation in which a large Central Bank is possibly starting the zero point and a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , senior staff of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is added to a relatively good performance level , trillion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate just a low inflation .
however the F@@ ed cannot ign@@ ore the less ro@@ cker outlook to global conditions .
it war@@ ns the markets to raise ourselves to an increase , but the signs indicate that the od@@ ds against such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 pm CET on Thursday
cause pe@@ dic@@ als at the Delta State University , left compensation
after the shoot and killing of his gir@@ l@@ friend on Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleagues and killed - wrote Sh@@ annon Record a note to say that it could be sorry for him , &quot; he could not make it aw@@ ry , &quot; said the authorities on Tuesday .
police in G@@ auti@@ cs , Mississippi , said that Lamb , Teacher , Geography and Social School of Science at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 noon on Monday morning .
and he said , He shot up on someone and someone killed him .
according to the staff of the not@@ ation centre , the police later sent police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it will probably be infl@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked him of his name , but he gave him not .
Lamb has no explanation for his feet .
when police operated the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I would do it too .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who loved me . &quot;
after a notice from the not@@ ation , record 300 miles to Delta State University , where he became E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killed before he finally took his own life on Monday night when police officers arrested him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; university president William La@@ For@@ ge said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he know nothing out of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something at Mr Lam@@ ber &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb is supp@@ os@@ edly believed that everyone had a relationship with Schmidt saying that , &quot; there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ ins@@ man was launched by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who testified that she had been married for roughly seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they were friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ un@@ iss gave up a daughter , who is 19 , and it was destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ un@@ ite had her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
catalog of To@@ bi@@ iss , live from home , according to testimony of Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les that was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss , having a dog called Light@@ ning , had been hit by Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wanted to help others to help others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Microsoft . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of a certain date on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not get into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police officers get him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville , later in that night , she drove towards his car , and fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , she was awarded a doctorate in Spring 2015 by Delta State University , and later she has encoun@@ tered the University &apos;s website .

all this is so sure its tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a large group structure .
every year , the Lufthansa Group is planning to save half a billion euros in the year alone .
150 of the globally approx . 1000 managers around the world will be consolidated before restructuring .
there is no new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
the Lufthansa is based on its business structure and now evalu@@ ates the cost @-@ effective Euro@@ wings .
the goal of the re@@ orientation shall be an annual contribution of about € 500 million every year from cost @-@ sales and replacement syn@@ ergi@@ es , distributed by the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there are no more board for the passenger business in the future .
the low @-@ fare for Euro@@ wings should be completely developed as independent as possible .
at the end of the board team around Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r will also be responsible for wings for Euro@@ wings in future .
with the new setting , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ scores the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group aims to compete with Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet .
to date , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the air routes operated under the umbrella of the Passage of Group , the three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion Euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
the collective air conflict with the pilot Association Fur@@ nit@@ ure ( VC ) should aim to begin the negotiations after the after@@ ward @-@ strike strike on this Thursday .
I shared the union with it .
theme of the discussion shall be the retirement of health .
cockpit finished in a year with a projected record result . result is possible to get bear@@ able results .
the conflict between Union and airline led to various strikes in the past months .
the background is next to the transitional provision of the pilot installation concept of Wings . &quot;
there is fore@@ front that the Lufthansa Cargo mobil@@ izes directly to the concer@@ t@@ ability of reas@@ on@@ ably cheap Euro@@ wings in the fight against competitors .

Luke Sha@@ w by Manchester United is not able to play monthly inc@@ ture for months
I was attended by Luke Sha@@ w in the Champions League @-@ defeat of Manchester on the PS@@ V Eindhoven , a double structure of his right leg .
while this is the left @-@ le@@ holder to weep and close it for at least six months from playing , Louis van G@@ aal the hope is not shown that Sha@@ w can play back in this season .
the wound was held by a det@@ on@@ ated attack by H@@ é@@ gy Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old sh@@ one had broken off in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field , and needed oxygen before he was transferred to the hospital .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has a double cap@@ t@@ inc@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will work tomorrow or maybe a day later and then surgery in Manchester .
it is aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then plays fantastic , and then what happens .
in the dressing unit he had a oxygen drum .
he wept .
I am no physician , but if you have a double volume , then the 6 month will last , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he will play this season again .
Mor@@ eno appeared happy , the red card and the susp@@ ending of a cub@@ ic@@ ature .
Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not been sentenced to Mexican .
van G@@ aal suggested that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself , if I say that there was an el@@ ap@@ t@@ meter and a red card .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a T@@ we@@ et to Sha@@ ws an account : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe how to destroy me , my way to the recovery starts now , I &apos;m coming back again . &quot;
thereby related : Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Sha@@ w near the PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the European Defense has an additional inc@@ enti@@ ve to recover until the coming June .
Philli@@ p Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the course with this kind of injury , all are very sad .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a wa@@ ist , when Mexico played a li@@ aison officer in Mexico at the World Bo@@ omer@@ ang Championships 2014 .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t feel difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the adversaries , and if you hear that it is a very worst case , it &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball had gone on a different way , so it looked at it as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno : &quot; I don &apos;t know how it feels like it can be heavy .
I feel very bad@@ ly . I &apos;m sorry for me .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also at the hospital , at a slope of Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly does David Cameron use the Lor@@ ax better ?
it is a matter which will learn all parents : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it completely .
unless you are , David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite child Book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , published in 1971 from Dr. Se@@ uss , published in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , wrote Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to give to my children , because it always seems to have a picture or message that we missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and well , except that the subsequent rows , in which David supp@@ os@@ edly describes the action of the book , instead gives a content of the film version of 2012 , which added new characters and details to enlarge the pretty little original text .
&quot; amid@@ st the ramp@@ arts town of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone , and even the air of a good tree is like Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , filled with her wish to be a real tree was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage he died in 1991 , but is completely unknown .
as if that &apos;s not more serious : the text consider@@ ate from Cameron is partially illustrated , as the summary of the Lor@@ ax cinema that is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , which is all artificial , and even the air is a merch@@ andise , a boy whose heart is like Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , to capture the girls of his dreams . &quot;
although he had access to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems to be un@@ likely that Cameron is ignor@@ ing the hand of the renowned bay leaf , such as the local environment through the well @-@ known Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ckey , be@@ ati@@ fying being , &quot; that speaks in the name of trees . &quot;
most likely , such a low PR task was deleg@@ ated to one assistant , who did not read The Lor@@ ax for not 20 times in a row .
one Dow@@ ning Street Spe@@ aks said that the text might probably come from Cam@@ er@@ &apos;s elec@@ toral commission .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was collected by Cam@@ er@@ 2 , but there was no further direct comments .
Adam Li@@ ons was more serious about exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still heavy
to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you select the K@@ ader , the England for the tour , there is a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test in defeat at my map .
I would not close a du@@ ck victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks Casino is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there is good spin @-@ player in the Batt@@ ing list , and the joint is strong ; they will not carry a sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ ose is evol@@ ved as a spin @-@ bowling and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size to test level , is an option for the attack .
related message : Adam Li@@ ons replaces part from the UK @-@ Test @-@ Lo@@ ader and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
the decision to meet Adam Li@@ ons , of course , is of course considered his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , of course .
during its seven tests , there was two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Cri@@ me players are ge@@ ared to test results .
no problem is that Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I said that - players are their own best sessions .
long ago it would have been extended the course of Li@@ th , but he had a control of his own fate .
if he hop@@ efully will rise in Yor@@ k@@ shire for a new chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss gave his post@@ ure , even if he did not get so good performance , and they surprised me not ; he is especially a team husband .
the question , how much time has a test @-@ test man receives , to make his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th received seven chances - as Sam Rob@@ son got before him - he was given to him while Nick Comp@@ ton nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to start home and departure .
the only for@@ cements which can be raised that England used to be depos@@ ited in the Caribbean - as ly@@ th in top form - but this lost chance now is now in the past .
Alex Hal@@ es come in , and he is a drummer who I want to play high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ mp@@ ed player , what we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he posted 236 people to find us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge .
it has to be at least the same chances of receiving a few , but this depends on the grid positions in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to ch@@ ase Mo@@ zz@@ ling in addition to Cook , which would get an extra @-@ spin strap and four Qu@@ icks are going on , and I do not have it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a h@@ d@@ ger could not strike there , and this left @-@ handed has already showed that he is a famine top of cri@@ cket players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mo@@ oring does not have his job done for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he has no number 3 for her , and there is no difference there .
my former team @-@ mate te@@ at has played his first 38 tests at the First Drop , before he appeared as an Op@@ ens in 2001 .
he has made three hundred races over us , and did not looked back .
Z@@ afar Pol@@ ari is afar off the K@@ ader as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited way he was impressed by him as a young man .
people may see its statistics - on an average of 31 with ar@@ ra@@ ckets and 35 with the ball - and thinking , it &apos;s a p@@ unt but there is no large number of backup chips , which rise up their hands and the trainer have chosen for youth .
this tour is going to learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England made a few available supplements of the team .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ ap@@ sack , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as an advisor for the test games could be a coup
he is one of the nic@@ est guy of the game who will bring a wealth of experience there he plays under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes out for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
my sure , I felt that he is created for the international Cri@@ cket Competition as a player , and as a coach , and how Mah@@ ela has he insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can be added to the dressing unit in fresh air , even if the news is being said in line with the risk .
coll@@ ages team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not be used with the One @-@ Day@@ ers ; root got a similar break to Australia and I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but Co@@ aches and team mates are not able to determine the schedule .
and you need to remember that , as in the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not affected in their hearts .
the Bre@@ x@@ it storage ( Bre@@ x@@ it = foreign direct from Britain ) could continue in ad@@ ore when the economy is in a fl@@ au@@ te force by 2017
David Cam@@ er@@ ons , an un@@ exp@@ elled real@@ location strategy to hold great Britain in the EU , is it &quot; Yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leaders of Labour or Tu@@ c , who sat through Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ ats , however , stated that some member states , deeply ro@@ oted in different cr@@ ises , as the EU is again and not always from its own fault , Great Britain himself , and un@@ distur@@ bing the contractual terms which they are not satisfied .
in Brigh@@ ton , Tu@@ c decided on their annual meeting that it may not like it , if it threat@@ ening the social protection .
we can also call Dave and Georges Bu@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of finance for summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capital cities make a photo of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without any local sizes , then come home and say that it gains allies .
it always goes around me .
my European boy@@ friend , who wishes outside the Great Britain &apos;s inside of the EU , &quot; Tell us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and makes us know that more and more brief inter@@ governmental offices and civil servants have come up to this point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or go .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a ally of Allied , but she &apos;s been in power for over 10 years and wants to leave the position before it would be bad for them , like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or his creation in 2017 .
he is also a p@@ ale force .
Poland , however , Poland has a nation@@ alist government , Spain would soon apply to Spain .
it falls heavily to imagine that they will get another form to help the sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Britain , whose energy should be deployed to get off from the UK - something that they do not want , because most of the similar separ@@ at@@ ist tend@@ encies .
that is why some such ministers may be se@@ d@@ ently no helpful remarks , throughout SN@@ P &apos;s style , during Britain &apos;s speech campaign in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , susp@@ ects my friend .
&quot; the main hearing was a Ple@@ ge &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won none of the re@@ acts . &quot;
the Europeans know how to@@ ber@@ k the Fle@@ et Street may be on their costs and which EU sc@@ ep@@ tics chosen the Oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ ons , however , as it had not been looking after the refer@@ endu@@ ms in 1973 with a 2 : 1 ratio .
you may be made weak to Boris Johnson , the ur@@ anium @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ istic , who made himself a name for the &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade @-@ ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels @-@ correspon@@ dent for the early 90 @-@ ies .
with all his de@@ im@@ iness the Ed Mil@@ i@@ band , who were his enemies .
in addition , the Med@@ ley of Government @-@ Cri@@ me shi@@ fts , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ing foreigners and the pseud@@ o non @-@ fer@@ rite , most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air thought about her , but noted that when you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , one can be better distributed to car@@ ess , rather than to raise him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mil@@ i@@ band himself had more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air himself , as he had failed to address Cam@@ er@@ one refer@@ endu@@ ms , because Bl@@ air had rejected the Constitution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , a back@@ door .
the press has never missed him .
but the cute Jeremy Med@@ ter@@ n who gave me the nice little ar@@ aps on the back at Westminster , but I said to him that he did not want more time for me - seems to repeat a problem , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ yk@@ cott Mur@@ doch &apos;s 80 @-@ year @-@ old , a mistake then , and today .

well , most people outside of U@@ k@@ gyp@@ sum traditional bub@@ bles tend@@ ency and the wild u@@ fil@@ den by Tor@@ ies Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can &apos;t say Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Ben@@ n@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television , said that the sc@@ outs pursu@@ ing in him , not ad@@ mit that Cor@@ by@@ ns prov@@ oked a bad idea in the physi@@ cist director of John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell .
it remin@@ ded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father was engaged in television to lose il@@ lo@@ yal to his Labour cabinet office , without losing the job and losing his cabinet .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle was still more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; under any circumstances - Ben@@ n &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , still told of his fellow @-@ war crimes and M@@ EP@@ s after all reports on Monday evening .
what &apos;s always willing to mediate the un@@ imag@@ ine Bott@@ om @-@ Up Image from Cor@@ ist@@ n , remember that he has even stir@@ red up in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the structure of the soci@@ etal media , a breeding ground of Par@@ ano@@ ia and Ver@@ rat .
it &apos;s right to give Cameron no Free Ticket for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the speech campaign for a matter of matter how Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins re@@ think so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns are basic added to the EU membership - in line with its ben@@ ite recovery industry , its anti @-@ capitalist style - is not just a question of the es@@ ot@@ eric discussion of left dis@@ sidents , for which the Nar@@ cis@@ si@@ der@@ us is a central base of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its material attention to Nato or Tom Wat@@ son , NATO is convinced that J@@ C will not take a campaign to with@@ hold foreign diplom@@ ats , in particular to find in everything a sense of their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin don &apos;t ask political capital , - they also have missed voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if this will be point@@ less ?
the US is already disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a donation of the T@@ ory government on power , which was remin@@ is@@ cent of something which I called to the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum .
expert &apos;s report of Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
statement by a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes less dam@@ aging are made from a meeting of 12 persons , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers .
experts , which were writing in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , were closed with Lanc@@ et by using the public Health UK ( P@@ he ) in her report about e @-@ cigarettes .
P@@ he published the &quot; Basic Sales report &quot; in the past month and describes him as an &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have asked the load @-@ handling of the data and refers to the connections between a few experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lanc@@ et last month &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fought the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily short conclusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the top of his annual conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two further researchers are written in BM@@ J &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and asked whether the asser@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor for Clinical Ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of the efficacy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said the public di@@ alling that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current estimate is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are approximately 95 % less dam@@ aging than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement from a single meeting of 12 people which were conven@@ ed in order to develop a model for a multiple criteria assessment ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to bring their opinions on the damage of various substances into synthesis ; the results of this meeting were collected in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting with a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was purchased by British American Tob@@ acco prize ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T on public health in a Sustainability Report , said it .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting noted that means of an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the funding that he should have received according to reports before Mr. Philip Morris International , we add to reports .
the reasons for the selection of the bodies of the Gre@@ g are not supplied but including several well known electric cigarettes are , some of which also specify an economic activity in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in table control .
the to@@ bac@@ cos was also attended by the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educ@@ ates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of hard evidence for the damage of most products at most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the claims by P@@ he said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no evidence today that e @-@ cigarettes as a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking for children or non @-@ smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well@@ being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he re@@ acted on the statements of BM@@ J &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in advance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are much less dam@@ aging than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life dog dies on his suit .
all evidence suggests that health risk of e @-@ cigarettes are small compared to low , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term impact .
in addition , P@@ he has the unique duty to inform@@ ing the public about what the evidence is proved and what is not , especially when there are as much public confusion about the relative risks in comparison to tobacco .
almost 80.000 people die annually in a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking is the National healthcare system cost 2 billion US $ per year .
by the clear advantages of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of failure that is caused by smoking , we fulfil our national competence .
BBC Should be East@@ on East@@ on , &apos; a former head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson said has said that the BBC should stop programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival , would be &quot; for hit shows as the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio charge should only be used to provide the type of programs which are not sent through other UK radio stations .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for that it &apos;s public law programmes , which are likely to be seen by a smaller au@@ dien@@ ces to come in hard against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals , and B@@ BC@@ 4 rival .
after the BBC @-@ Director , Tony Hall , said the company had to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to come into contact with television for six years with his time in Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that the BBC programs have been commissioned , which are also clearly indicated by the un@@ conventional ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson said the Upper House Communication Committee in the framework of his research on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to keep the radio charge , which I hold in the middle or long term for good ideas , one should at least give it at least for programmes , the other not or in order .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve a as possible support for their future .
the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , it is of course impossible .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs that can be financed without pay@@ outs .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , aff@@ ord@@ ed and both own productions .
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for this .
I ende@@ av@@ our to see how this public television would be in public .
I don &apos;t think that the BBC would ever reduce the BBC .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC bl@@ ame for rating is &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of the people who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broadcast of the BBC will return back what the former head of Sky , Tony &apos;s , at his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows how East@@ poin@@ ter should sell .
Johnson said that the more publicly @-@ legal native N@@ ic programs &quot; should go to B@@ BC@@ 4 , but they are unable to analy@@ ze their tasks , and they are to ar@@ gue , when they have created all these form@@ ulas programs that nobody has seen it . &quot;
they put them in a time window , where nobody wanted to see her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wireless charge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I encourage you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive System in terms of conditions those who can get the best value . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you think all , think you get a great value for 150 £ every year , but for people who is a lot of money for the 150 pounds , ask me whether this is true , because she doesn &apos;t consume much from the BBC .
the former Sky@@ net and Channel 5 CEO David El@@ stein , who testified before the Committee on Tuesday , asked that the BBC will check their irrit@@ ation mission to provide information , make and entert@@ ained . &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC &apos;s production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it would be 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % in the radio , and it should change this in &quot; inform you to clari@@ fy and maintain . &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television are going into action , and using the commercial effects of alli@@ ances will make all online available .
&apos;@@ Speci@@ ogen@@ etics &apos; can control brain cell by sound waves

scientists have cultivated wor@@ ms with genetic change nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ at@@ odes move the direction in the moment , in which they are listening to the human ear on high frequencies decided to be heard .
the im@@ pulses are character@@ ised by switching engines of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genet@@ ically modified to improve the membrane channels , the results in ultr@@ as@@ ound .
related to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers , the researchers demonstrated the power of a new method , called Son@@ ogen@@ etics that can be used in ultr@@ as@@ ound to enable a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .

the bub@@ bles , found out , he increased the ultr@@ as@@ ound sensors , which are then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms .
the enhanced ultr@@ as@@ ound monitors work on structures which are called by TR@@ P @-@ 4 cy@@ on@@ channels and can be found in membran@@ es with some of the cut@@ ters .
the sound waves contribute the opening of these audio channels and enable the cells to which they are assigned to a report of Nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ as@@ ound @-@ controlled bacteria , Hal@@ as@@ ani genet@@ ically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ings TR@@ P @-@ 4 can carry channels .
when ultr@@ as@@ ound applies to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ waves and put in the wor@@ ms where they switch on the changed mot@@ on@@ ers .
the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with op@@ to@@ genet@@ ics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to penet@@ rate neur@@ ons with light and light .

in contrast to light , that has to be sent back to a optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , cannot be character@@ ised by low @-@ ultrasonic hum@@ or t@@ issues and may thus be sent to the brain from up@@ set up to the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gen@@ res and therapeutic virus it is possible that human neur@@ ons are temporary to invol@@ ve an ultr@@ as@@ ound signal in a clinical approach for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for life in student residence halls
eleven years ago I found a university entrance hall in a residence hall , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the terr@@ ors of the sm@@ iles I have off@@ ended - and many , many dur@@ many complaints about others .
most of the things I have learned , can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the train in student residence halls reaches from slightly ner@@ ve up to absolute .
that is pet@@ ting to ch@@ att@@ ing : people tell whether you &apos;re coming back as if you are called Sab@@ b@@ ite , and why you don &apos;t love &quot; hon@@ est@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite and why you &apos;re &quot; hon@@ est , like in the Ernst &quot; guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract h@@ ah@@ aha , I am in my room . &quot;
bre@@ athe through you .
then help others to do the same - have any questions and show your interest .
it guides you to find out the conversation which you will find out in contrast to those who would not tell you even if your lashes were burned in fire and this fire extingu@@ ishers .
let people leave people .
the rooms of people are often walking in drinks @-@ reception , film @-@ night venues and municipal meet , but they are also the places on which humans wear and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not think at the University with a relationship to start
in@@ tro comments received a major treatment at the university .
your room should be a fug@@ ium , but many students of residence create a room to room @-@ B@@ um@@ mel culture , which kind of friendly and soci@@ ally and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be the hell for someone who tries to recover him .
nothing of the culture permits you to say : &quot; I like you , and I wish that our friendship is going away , but you must go away that I have consumed the Energy that I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow recru@@ it is exhau@@ sted - and send SMS instead of t@@ apping .
A@@ pro@@ po@@ s an@@ cho@@ ck : do it .
a guy in my student halls had the idea that a non @-@ closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship with che@@ ek .
since you start the Uni at the cli@@ max of the Back @-@ Man@@ y , the Hammer@@ ing feels complete with a plate full of Brow@@ ni@@ es , some strange as the welcome of the 1950 @-@ 90s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I always smile you when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
a home @-@ made tre@@ ats offer a good way to close friendship .
your roommate feel obliged to maintain and will associate your face with a tasty surprise at the end .
of course it depends on whether you are a fixed b@@ aker .
po@@ or@@ ly mixed cl@@ umps with flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping for sleeping when you ank@@ lo@@ ot .
to steal food is a 3rd crime in student residence .
of course , this clause of chicken is a theft , but is it possible to take the drops of m@@ ics for your tea ?
check that with the milk dispos@@ s@@ ess .
the od@@ ds are well cared for use , even when they cook , even when they are in the interior .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , is anno@@ ying , and you have compassion , and so try to deal with it as my fellow resident , who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent in their milk to pun@@ ish th@@ ieves .
now she is in prison .
you should make no noise when travelling either from sleep or job .
it is not only concerned , a man @-@ resistant human being , but that you are , in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb concerning people , who are sitting in the glass of glass .
a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neighbours , whether it &apos;s something ready to make Dr@@ um &amp; Bass , because there are three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an examination on the morning .
they responded to ur@@ king music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she left her neighbours sleeping for two hours before she left their own music , closed her door and went down to her three @-@ hour test .
would it be romantic , if your future sp@@ ouse would come to a residence in the same student residence ?
on the contrary , it would be not really ab@@ dom@@ inal that , when you take a person of your future wife , they will separate themselves , and then they will see each day , how to bring together all the common friends ?
of course , the heart of his own ways - but if a hot club is definitely not your future wife , try , try at least , your under@@ coat a little reason .
in the exciting moment , where you notice that someone has lost its key in its non @-@ closed room , the border is between a Ul@@ k and Mo@@ b@@ bing , when it seems .
a good draw is funny , but it takes only moments when it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
please choose a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but you never want any bad room with t@@ ooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close your door , and place their keys in a glass of water , which you will then place in the freezer - but if you did their owners at the ceiling anymore than twice .
tow@@ n@@ houses for refugees , single @-@ wing , Ger@@ ing@@ ch@@ mer@@ er
in the middle of the se@@ w@@ ling St. G@@ ild@@ ner , the real estate business Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds a little money for people who have not lots of money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus for refugees - but as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees require dor@@ m , but also the only ce@@ ful mother and Ger@@ ing@@ dal@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show how you can still be able to build and develop well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are situated on the Market H@@ alls .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believed to know how quickly and less space can be created : it builds in a project tow@@ n@@ house for refugees .
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees are mig@@ rated to the H@@ ousing Market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass housing of containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for humans remain a large part here .
the number of hab@@ itat is also required for decades in the next decades .
a completely ban@@ gles , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a terra@@ ced house needs first place .
it makes integration .
it is different if you spend people in blocks .
each of the six homes , which are currently constructed in a pilot project , consists of three units specially for asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees are saying that it is peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be converted according to the respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 m2 of living space per house is 2@@ 184 000 Euro .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted for six months .
this is appropriate .
does the regulations out@@ fit their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : in particular , I made my project correctly .
and particularly complicated , it always makes the thr@@ illing D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es value and the placement regulation .
cre@@ ep@@ y performance .
it is still under@@ lined , who creates three appart@@ ments in a terra@@ ced house are three pitches .
only in cities are missing the place .
and individuals and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were who made me accused of creating a building for asylum seek@@ ers .
which is definitely not right .
but don &apos;t help the competitors for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : it &apos;s true : &quot; we had a building boom in Germany last five years , but 5 luxurious apartments that can aff@@ ord themselves hardly any more .
my project managed the message , even the normal people need hab@@ itable .
not only refugees , but also her mother or Ger@@ ing@@ dal@@ er .
I &apos;ll show how you can still be able to build .
hence it is all .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS version if Apple released Mac version
the new operating system can be requested by selecting the Add @-@ App to &quot; General &quot; and then &quot; Software Update . &quot;
if it is ready , you will install the phone option to download and then .
some are after installation on problems , because they receive an error message , which means the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to get the problem , it is recommended to wait either until the look@@ out is back@@ wards or try to upgrade to iTunes .
the phone itself is connected by the rest of the process .
this may be possible to del@@ eting the ext@@ inction of apps , but Apple has made it more likely to build this through the locks on update of the update . likewise , it will be easier to delete apps once you need to re @-@ install apps once the process is completed .
it is worthwhile to ensure your mobile phone is charged during update or is located near a charging unit , so the battery is charged .
if the charge is too low , Apple doesn &apos;t appro@@ ve that the update will be continued , as the phone may limit on half @-@ way and this will lead to a break@@ down of the updates .

Dr. Frank Müller takes the practice of rock breaks and invests 3@@ 10000 €
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ o@@ ausen .
Moreover , we are also pleased to have Sam@@ o@@ co @-@ Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Economics in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwartz and As@@ endor@@ sement mayor Hein@@ o Kab@@ bert .
in many places , the physi@@ cians , As@@ endorf , however , were lucky : Dr. Frank Müller takes the practice of rock breaks around the 1st of October .
while Ur@@ sel &apos;s mission is reti@@ re , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich stepp@@ ed up to his successor in the next few months .
after a recent phase , Müller opens the practice again on 12 October until then the station will invest 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympath@@ y on the first sight , when the Fel@@ o@@ ist ahead of years Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently met their specialist vocational education in the general hospital and learned to jump into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the m@@ iller could fit good in this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ o@@ ausen and laugh@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it was time , I just ph@@ oned them . &quot;
the idea , the couple of Müller , decided to operate in our own practice at As@@ endorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close and constant contact to the patient are very attractive for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to know and accompany families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage he see , soon his own chef has to be his own .
and so one was hon@@ est , the m@@ iller bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen - Vil@@ sen .
in addition , the two @-@ time family grand@@ father Frank Müller was also raised , his medical medicine in Hanover followed by several physician offices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a Senior Physi@@ cian in Sul@@ ingen . in addition , he was constituted in 2009 for the leading emer@@ itus in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged in honorary economics in the DRC @-@ read@@ iness of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen .

while the sur@@ geon Dr@@ um Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ is worked as a home doctor , his wife specialised in Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in ) special@@ izes in Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the m@@ iller , both inter@@ ns , are regarded as a household .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy is therefore out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Mu@@ eller G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the renovation , the rooms will look like .
we are offering more ultr@@ as@@ ound examination as well as long @-@ term and resource EK@@ GS and need a speaking room more .
in addition the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
an allowance amounting to 50,000 Euro will get the m@@ iller within the framework of a sponsor@@ ship program from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; this shows how proud and joy@@ ful we are glad to keep the practice , &quot; emphas@@ ized the commitment of relation to Bernd Bor@@ mann .
about 2000 patients were employed according to the area of Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , each quarter in practice of rock breaks , in the North German average practice of roughly 500 .
at As@@ endorf there is another home practice .
a positive effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ o@@ ausen at As@@ endorf .
if no success@@ ors have found , it would have gone .
whoever has visited the m@@ iller of speaker , looks even especially in trusted faces : takes over the seven medical experts and the cleaning force of the field of rock .
with the f@@ arewell in the village of Er@@ a , the medical profession had been practi@@ ced there for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning we only had two rooms , &quot; the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ o@@ ausen is u@@ ck@@ eted .
a little mid@@ wives now glorify it after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or while they often see many patients often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the story . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband adds : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; so far I pushed me down the garden work , now it could be different . &quot;
the couple received two grand@@ sons and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls is beyond our border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister of Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border continue in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is clear that everyone who wants to put an asylum request to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; naturally &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supplies and security of man stands in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it turns clear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the people must know that we don &apos;t accept de@@ pl@@ ess migration flows , also not beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia wasn &apos;t thinking &quot; cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia is forbidden
the Croatian government previously informed that pro@@ filing of Slovenia well in the direction of Austria and Germany , and may well put cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
however , so , the Minister of Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ l@@ kö@@ y Z@@ ni@@ ers , however , did not see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors may be &quot; absolutely in@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , the monitoring of borders - especially in Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the limit on Croatia is already strong for the outside of the Sch@@ engen area .
as the Minister of Culture said , Sloven@@ es will continue with its borders for refugees but didn &apos;t wake .
&quot; each EU member must fill his obligations , otherwise the system will not work , &quot; stressed by Gy@@ ör@@ bear@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tempted to travel to Tuesday , in Ost@@ cro@@ ati@@ a , on the cross @-@ crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id , in order to avoid the registration .
however , the Croatian police opened its area in the near drop@@ outs .
according to their local media , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , a police vehicle with new refugees have been meeting since then .
it was predominantly about Syrians and Afghanistan , among them numerous women and children .
perhaps the li@@ fe@@ at and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the next few days , his country with around 4000 refugees said : Internal Affairs , Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , said .
other buses were also taken from Pre@@ se@@ vo , on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian Serbian border , where migrants were exp@@ elled to the Hungarian border in the direction of Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
however , the government settled in Belgrade expected that they should comp@@ ose the people to adopt security : &quot; neither can we do this , neither will we do it , &quot; says it .
according to media reports , at the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border city S@@ id were arriving at the day .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been around 500 kilometers away from the Vad@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border by Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary had made , so the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria wanted to travel to Germany .
thus , it could actually be to be already predicted for ob@@ serving the previous Balkan between Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities to control the border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Minister of Interior , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic also emphas@@ ised that his country has prepared appropriate plans for the immediate effect of refugees for possible measurement situations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not use it ; however , he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Sch@@ engen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive facilities for &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you bring rig@@ orous controls to qualify for membership in the Sch@@ engen area for membership .
Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007 , the EU partners starting a good reference since then , concerned the standard of the border controls .
on Serbian page about 300 refugees continue behind Hungarian border .
according to Belgian Media reports , the last night at the border crossing the Hor@@ g@@ os , who flew to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , reports .
according to Hungarian authorities , the two border units Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to remain fully closed .
whether the remaining fug@@ ues wish to travel on the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
during the Serbian Minister of War Neb@@ oj@@ sa Stef@@ anovic was still trying to calm during a local trade in hor@@ g@@ os : he &apos;ll hold the debates concerning the alternative bodies of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , was no early .
it would currently not be very high number of refugees .
you could not say if they would continue their trip to Hungary , Croatia or other country .
assistant , Mig@@ rants to - Dang@@ erous For@@ ativity Fa@@ usses
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to divide country maps on which alternative routes are comp@@ acted by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe ; in parts of the limit there are also 20 years after the end of the conflict still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announce that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .
stock market h@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians made 30 million dollars

in this way , the prosecutor was promoted to a total of over 100 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current comparison shows that even those outside of our borders were finally caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the SEC registration message . &quot; &quot; &quot;

most of the def@@ endants were from Ukraine and Georgia .

therefore , this public response to 20 @-@ year @-@ olds was good .
that not everyone on the tables publicly dis@@ closed , be under@@ stand@@ able , and finally , it was a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still adher@@ ed to as before with tab@@ oos , the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , even the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , even the great moves of ag@@ it@@ ers in the last few years , that the people were open .

F@@ ed@@ Ex d Pro@@ p The Price Outlook for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex dis@@ appoint@@ ments the latest results for the last quarter and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Giant board l@@ ending its profit margin for a whole year due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs associated with goods service .
the company also said that she plans to throw about 55@@ .000 seasonal workers for vacation .
at this point in last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to offer 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
share fell at more than 2.5 percent in the press market trading 45 minutes before the opening ceremony on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said that would earn an profit of $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10,@@ 90 in fiscal year ending in May , 20 cent less than that of previous pre@@ diction .
anal@@ ysts expect in a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower views are despite the price increases , which are an average of 4.9 percent and effective January 4 , despite higher price of heavy goods transport for heavy and large pack@@ ets that will be collected from the beginning of November .
however , the company claimed that these revenues were earned in the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and due to growth in the online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith states that the company demonstrates a solid profit if you were weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in production and global@@ ized trading .
the plans for the holiday occupation were announced one day later as the civil service , that is planning to recru@@ it 9@@ 0,000 - 9@@ 5,000 employees , roughly the same number as last year .
in the quarter of August which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex fi@@ ve@@ ited 6@@ 92 million US $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
the earnings per share stood at 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the € 2.@@ 44 per share , the T@@ wel@@ ve of Investment Research publications consul@@ ted anal@@ ysts .
net sales increased 5 percent to 12.4 billion $ .
the six of the c@@ acks expected to expected an expected 12.@@ 23 billion .
in the past few years F@@ ed@@ Ex has introduced a decline in international high quality packaging which he stag@@ n@@ ating in its unit Express shipment .
the boom in the online shopping shop has increased the results by F@@ ed@@ Ex .
in the final quarter the sales growth was 29 percent by the road , but the operating result was basically flat for higher cost of large pack@@ ets and self @-@ insurance .
the Express Unit reported a higher revenues due to higher prices , while earnings regarding a higher labour costs in the cargo business again .
at Pre@@ market trading , about one hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , at 15@@ 0.15 $ .
on Tuesday they enclosed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .

threatened with them at an end of the ench@@ anted , double @-@ headed seat sh@@ it , a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is rec@@ olle@@ ction of that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ pers and their colleagues will focus on the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a double order from the congress : maximum period of US employment and prices stable here .
but since the big recession having been recognized the F@@ ed Leader , the F@@ ed is an un@@ forgotten third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate may be the X @-@ factor in a decision to make it ben@@ evol@@ ved . it will be announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to be dra@@ in@@ dul@@ ged by its gathered short @-@ term interest rate by the close of 2008 .
although most data of the economy showed that it grows very solid , the latest Tur@@ bul@@ ences on the global financial markets such as the pre @-@ fac@@ tual F@@ ed representative can make this vol@@ at@@ ility by raising the interest rate for government bonds - and be it only around a quarter pp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation would be the most important thing that they have observed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lind@@ sey , Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief econom@@ ists in the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ cks &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think , if they were looking for a pre@@ text to increase interest rate , increased un@@ certainty on the global market is enough right to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sen@@ sus about what the F@@ ed is doing what makes the financial market un@@ sure about .
about half of the econom@@ ists which were recently question@@ ed from Bloom@@ berg have had a interest rate this week .
most financial markets are however still expecting the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows just a 30 % chance to increase on an increase .
this indicates a decrease of the stock market if the F@@ ed raises the proposition , unless the strateg@@ ist raises the blow to say , by allowing that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average value rose by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations for the F@@ ed Policy dated the set in this week , John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences in that time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she do it , they must very far go well in its explanation for the financial markets that they do not fall into pan@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a cr@@ rate hike is to calm the financial markets , because they will act the un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed should act .
one month ago , the F@@ ed appeared on a good way to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points to the month , the first small step in a slow disappearance of mon@@ et@@ ical terms to test the strength of recovery in the United States .
in spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen had already said during Spring and early summer , despite the need of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the proposition acquired .
although the creation of employment opportunities in August slow@@ down , the improvement on the labour market was slow@@ ed sound this year .
the unemployment rate declined to 5.1 % in the past month , has been lowest since more than seven years and close to the levels given by the F@@ ed as full @-@ time employment .
wage increases are shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the aim of the 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representative reports that the main reason is a temporary dip .
the economy &quot; could reduce higher rates on interest rates and used it because of the tension in the labour market , &quot; said Ian , bl@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ bi@@ ans .
but the financial markets around the whole world had risen once at the end of the last month , after China had recycled his currency .
in May , the Dow Jones Industrial Average value fell by more than 16 % , while investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would be the key economic growth .
the market has recovered slightly in this month , with the Dow &apos;s stands at nearly 10 % below the start of May .
for the F@@ ed representative , the market tur@@ mo@@ il influence the complex calculation process , when you should increase interest .
&quot; when the events occurred on financial markets and the news on the weakness of Chinese economy in the past few weeks would not have occurred , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and an ex @-@ worker of U.S. music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now he predic@@ ts that they will be waiting at least one month to get the effects better into the handle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certainty that will be the impact on the US economy , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers .
the health of the world economy is none of the headquarters of the F@@ ed , hence they should not be involved in recognition of their decision @-@ making .
but in the end result , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous throughout the last years .
the mere editor of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke , in the year 2013 , that the F@@ ed could narrow its mon@@ et@@ ical expansion , &quot; revealed con@@ fu@@ sions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly being question@@ ed together , could monitor from the F@@ ed representative , that it is not only advis@@ able to monitor the developments in other areas , but also to obtain a better understanding to the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art as science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the asset management company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; En@@ v@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeffrey L@@ acker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA . , noted that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of inter@@ actions on financial market movements that are not associated with the economic fundament@@ al@@ izer .
L@@ acker , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , adjusted for interest @-@ rate hike and quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their lead by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limit@@ ing recogni@@ z@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ acker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representative repeated these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only place the aspects of financial stability during a severe economic crisis , such as market situation in 2008 , said Adam S. Pos@@ en , a former member of the Committee on the financing of the Bank of England .
the youngest tur@@ mo@@ il come not into the matter of this plane , said he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she will certainly not fall into the situation , because she is afraid of a interest @-@ rate , because the markets wanted to set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said pos@@ es , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act always contains the double mandate and mentioned not the financial stability , and till this is changed , I do not believe that it should reach time .

there are always more refugees in Germany in these days .

Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric company Rio Grande do food for healthy feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organisation SP@@ RS attempts to clari@@ fy women on a sho@@ cking manner on how important good food during stag@@ nation . she is doing this with the presentation of images of babies that su@@ cks to breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of illegal foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , the babies do all nutrients you need to get a strong immun@@ ological system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers get increased their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake should not be the only di@@ et@@ etic adjustment to take the mothers .
a current study under the leadership of Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , shows that a healthy diet that affects the genes of their babies and protect them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , a healthy diet of the child can influence the immune system negative .
excep@@ tions to the new Bern@@ ative Sports Hall
the Municipal Council of Bern@@ ried authorized the building contract for the 2.3 million Euro @-@ expensive sports hall .
and he was an exception .
the roof is permitted to reach a solar system .
the planning for the long @-@ sigh@@ ted period building at the Bern@@ rie@@ der sports complex proceed by step forward : in the most recent meeting of the meeting in 2007 , the worked buil@@ ders without major discussions was un@@ prepared .
prior to other things , the board had decided to respect the &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development planning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was permission was used by permission to form a special form . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , a &quot; saddle cone with non @-@ corporate First and attic space is to be erected . &quot;
background of planning is intended use of the roof space for solar thermal systems : &quot; this way we get a wonderful great southern d@@ ed@@ ach together , &quot; said mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger said in the session .
in the &quot; Liberation , &quot; in turn was a rec@@ ep@@ le@@ aning the roof of energet@@ ic reasons - other than in the development plan - other than 10 degrees Celsius .
the volume of the hall will be considerably reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan measures not restri@@ ct an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excep@@ tions - where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bern@@ sem@@ ary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has restri@@ c@@ tive restri@@ c@@ tive to the liberation movement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , at the gym , it is no recur@@ ring project : &quot; we &apos;re not able to create a preced@@ ent case , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gym is hall@@ u@@ ching on the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and of SV Bern@@ ried .
approx . 2.3 million euros are calculated at costs .
grants are expected by means of training and university funding .
in the next process of proce@@ eding , the building contract for the 18 x 36 metre hall is now submitted to the land@@ lord .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg draws near Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is planned to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is a new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station as well as the majority of the employees passes by P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg with the Sch@@ ong@@ au Island .
this will see the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the Land@@ di@@ ac , who confirmed the Land@@ shut in Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
this corresponds to a decision on the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans should be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees were busy at the hospital at P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should be surrounded with Fischer and the more existing inside to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
the workers who do not work with Sch@@ ong@@ au , will be offered to a workplace in W@@ eil@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the staff are informed about plans .
she inv@@ oked the change in the termination of Dr Andreas E@@ der , who is only the beginning of the beginning of Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik , which is now moving to a private practice near the hospital .
on the question that the succession should be made , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fis@@ her@@ man &quot; in the game that had ready to take over from 1st October , take the lead to Sch@@ ong@@ au and with his team after Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the home in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this would be an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreci@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wider range of the range in the area &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for cardiovascular and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .

transitional arrangements for the next two years should be managed by his team when the board is right to lift both houses until then next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ let , which still has 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after nearly 140 years .
the administrative district has so far planned for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment is completed at the W@@ eil@@ heim hospital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s going out with the property , J@@ och@@ ner &apos;s white could not say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can lay multiple calls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present there are some short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a psychiat@@ ric rop@@ sych@@ iat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened to us did not happen , such an opportunity is not able to get back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer said on the empty , which had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and highly under@@ stand@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have not given a real difference for the house in which Fischer has been working as Chief Editor for over 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer Colle@@ agues to take over the post of the Medical Director .
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was still threatened by closing time , departments were closed , for example the surgery and birth@@ place .

refugees need accommodations : study of vac@@ u@@ ation
the situation in the German housing market is stra@@ ined .
and more refugees search for a paid stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing building is faced with a challenge .
the distribution of distribution in the German housing market has long since begun .
with the upcoming refugees and labor sear@@ ches from the EU , more people on a market which over@@ loaded in many large cities is now over@@ loaded .
they are competing with income and income around the final paid apartments .
in order to meet demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built until 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result is a study on the order of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Soci@@ etal Build@@ ings &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are ready in Germany this year .
there@@ with are 14@@ 0,000 apartments .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as an asylum seek@@ ers in a Initi@@ al accommodation .
many collect them in the housing market and rows in the long ser@@ p@@ ents in front of the rental apartments .
according to the Federal Office , however , less than half of the asylum seek@@ ers came to rent .
the negative development of the housing market is not only rising by increasing the population .
the study also makes significant fail@@ ures in building @-@ building policy of the last years .
Germany has been a deficit of food from year to year .
at present , Matthias Günther is missing in the urban metrop@@ olitan areas , compl@@ ains Matthias Günther , author of the study .
so many working men lived in large cities listed in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed permanently in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; due to the lo@@ au@@ te on the H@@ ousing Market .
in major cities the number of meters per capita in last years has declined .
for the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social Ac@@ ti@@ housing &quot; proposes a re@@ boot .
new inc@@ en@@ tives to re@@ launch the social housing developments .
for example , a tax @-@ property tax could be wai@@ ved and the property tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats will be suspended .
Moreover , this agreement wants to offer attractive tax purposes in accordance with the alliance .
the refugee programme for Refu@@ ge@@ es in the state bank of Kf@@ W has already been well received in cities and communities already well .
a good week after the start was completed on Monday evening with 184 million Euros already more than half of the $ 300 million available .
this project could now be raised up .
refugees have a non @-@ profit : Croatia and Slovenia cor@@ ridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary , practically no fish is gone , since more than for more refugees in the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb announces that it is announ@@ cing the journey across Slovenia into north without hur@@ dles .
un@@ dangerous is the route but nonetheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia via the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have spoken a cor@@ ridor with Sloven@@ ian internal minister , and when necessary , we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister ( Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already the Sch@@ engen area .
the Croatia country in Croatia is not a narrow land .
according to the outcome of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have broken off to Croatia to get to Western Europe .
500 people were come over the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , as the German TV broad@@ caster RTL .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees at the V@@ ort@@ day .
new laws that entered into force on the same day were virtually un@@ su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous in Hungary .
Croatia wants to bring the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those people are there , women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve anything .
however , people that don &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
on the morning , the Croatian police seized the Serbian majority of Serbia and Croatia &apos;s neighbouring country Croatia .
most of the media reports were reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they both came by bus and tax@@ is to the Serbian border of S@@ id .
immediately after her arrival , they had tried to arrive on foot across the green border to Croatia .
in the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees meet not hiding at the fron@@ tier .
there are other dangers involved in this regard : there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav and civil war in the 1990s .
min@@ e@@ fields is supposed to create a secure passage now .
after Hungary , no more refugees have gone after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday , the police counted day 366 .
shortly before the end of the evening , there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws apply the Over@@ coming and Dam@@ aging of the border to us as an off@@ ence .
therefore , 35 cases were initiated in the South Hungarian border city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convicted are st@@ ains pen@@ alties of up to five years and draw off the deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , we met in the newly established &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ oning &quot; with a total of 94 political asylum applications , of which almost all - 93 are on the main transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
amongst the applicant , 13 families were among small children and two older people .
there had still 40 refugees to be left in the middle of the morning .
however , there is no longer a view to have granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; Hungarian &apos;s opinion is a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
the most beautiful asylum seek@@ ers will be abolished .
only few hundred refugees were gathered together at the &quot; Trans@@ inion &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke the workers began to w@@ ren@@ ew .
they collected the gar@@ bage which left tens of thousands of people in the road@@ side last weeks .
pl@@ ywood were dismant@@ led and rebuilt from the storage facility at the border .
no one wants to be apparent . to the end of this reconstruction .
Austria were only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the land also reinforced its border control .
but about 20.000 people were arrested in the country , but still in the country .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people wait for the drive to Germany .
the train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on assignment German authorities .
several groups of refugees meet regularly in Freil@@ assing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Based &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; About the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were with the bridge on Sunday with the evacu@@ ation , when suddenly there were ten people with travel agents on the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as legendary mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to visit with the train to Passau .
because in fact , on Sunday but because of the refugee &apos;s refugee camp sur@@ prisingly , the railway traffic with Austria was sur@@ prisingly demanded , the city council , who immediately gathered his assistance and gathered together with two further hel@@ pers and their cars on the border to the Middle East .
before we had first looked up , we soon ro@@ asted , with lunch and drinks .
we have to do it , we bring it to Passau with a car .
&quot; that was a course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N talks .
they were very grat@@ eful .
a man had not let it take a generous donation - 100 euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; we have very pleased , &quot; such as Stad@@ ler .
the up @-@ standing train tracks were cir@@ cl@@ ed from a ICE in Wels from a ICE in a regional train in the direction of Passau , Germany , after the brief notice that the railway traffic was stopped in Germany , but still to try the border .
however , the regional train was qu@@ arri@@ ed before the border in Wer@@ n@@ stein on the river Inn .
in Wer@@ n@@ stein the border crossing general is generally high in the course .
the bridge , featuring the Bavarian neighbours at the Sunday , becomes a bridge @-@ lasting and - organized by the Union Wer@@ n@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
his Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends hundreds of thousands of points to us , however , the result of a logical policy :
rather than in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp at the erection of structures , our Federal Chancellor than@@ ked up officially and publicly commemor@@ ated the attitude of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ ies of National Soci@@ alism .
bodies that these policy are not only those Austrian who are now con@@ fron@@ ted in the bound@@ aries with cha@@ otic distur@@ ban@@ ces .
the poultry country will also need to find that the &quot; acc@@ la@@ imed land , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , nothing more than another refugee camp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge in view of the ongoing revi@@ ves and the nearby winter to restore the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deser@@ ted condition &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be a t@@ aller - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35,000 w@@ inter@@ permanent qu@@ arti@@ berries
Konrad , with the refugee camp all hands fully committed to them .
Christian Konrad was acc@@ ust@@ omed to him that his word has weight .
the government has used the former strong &quot; Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank &quot; to set up comp@@ ost for thousands of thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first @-@ opening Centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already arrived in the handle .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless people over Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported his first success .
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without a big missions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organiz@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Interior Ministry put out a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ris@@ ky situation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a total of 85@@ ,000 Qu@@ arti@@ facts is looking forward to a total of 85@@ ,000 quotes .
to achieve the number , 35,000 units must be found in the coming weeks - 20.000 are supposed to provide the country for 15,000 of the covenant .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; but it is not a barrel without a bottom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had already led convers@@ ations with the coun@@ tri@@ but@@ aries .
these had been assured with him , as well for the upcoming refugees Qu@@ arti@@ ere .
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar is back .
tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christophe Schön@@ born , needs to be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
great expectations , the asylum @-@ coordinator experiences also in the ORF campaign , &quot; Hel@@ ping as We . &quot;
individuals can offer private individuals stra@@ ight@@ forward in the platform .
furthermore you hop@@ ing for hotels that are empty during winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ized the standards for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the note hours it could not be that qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors must stick a certain height of the hand@@ tu@@ ch@@ holder or the size of the finishing .
for a temporary time , &quot; Emergency Standard &quot; would need .
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he is his experience and Konrad based in his experience .
I am an older lord , whom we do not simply telling the mo@@ dest@@ y .
convic@@ tion strength is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er don &apos;t cause any costs to explain how they are explained .
they wish to increase their number of employees to 3 to four .
the own qu@@ arti@@ er@@ one has still not been successful .
Konrad wanted to set a container at the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are evi@@ den@@ ced problems with the permission .
Linz invites a better distribution
just no opening of urban sports hall and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning for the city of Linz .
this is not necessary unless the data subject is to be made without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) .
in case of emergency , other locations are due to be checked for money .
critic@@ ised by the Chief Executive Officer at the division of the refugees near the federal state .
other districts have also to aff@@ ord their contribution .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; bound@@ aries will not be sealed &quot;
in a extended telephone with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ehr@@ inger ( VP ) adopted another pioneer in the refugee &apos;s refugees .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er decided that the German borders are not to be sealed .
the res@@ ot@@ ting of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is now the respective border control .
special trains with refugees to Germany will not be given no more .
however , the protective search would have been brought into Germany with regular journeys .
member of the other European member states &apos; stir@@ rer once again called to greater solidarity in the refugee movement .
that now Austria means to take over on its borders , it is &quot; a logical episode &quot; from the out@@ going of the Germans .
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a matter of time
the Great Ship@@ yard of the &quot; New Ship@@ yard &quot; at the Lin@@ zer Industrial Revolution is officially completed .
in four of the six store@@ ys of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T operates , the rest ( 2700 square metres ) should be rented for young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in the IT , the smart heads of our raw material and we are to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T Group CEO Hannes Ar@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine to invest in the start@@ up companies of the New Ship@@ yard , and later also , which will return .
already from the beginning S &amp; T plans to co@@ operate with the new neighbours - there is quite a large opportunity that the next R@@ unt@@ astic is only a matter of time . &quot;
EUR 1.7 million were invested by S &amp; T in the facility , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which is one third of the city of Linz , Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .

L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ ad opened your second business in the ar@@ cade

in the fur@@ la @-@ shop opposite the business , in which it sells bags , shoes , shoes and clothes of various manufacturer , it &apos;s all around fashion hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la , Wall@@ ets have been starting from 75 euro .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
it had been changed several weeks ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have hop@@ ed for a long time , that I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Bre@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was among others that the Fur@@ t@@ apos@@ e producers , who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a site , where only their hand@@ bags are sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the one in the big room of Linz , which we sell this piece , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has been done with Bre@@ ite by her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I talk about most , if something develops and I can show new trends at competitive prices .
why may some wife answer a beautiful hand@@ bag in ornam@@ entation , so the house@@ wife can not respond to the last security .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag is enhanced any out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer family from Donald Tr@@ ump came out of a village whose inhabitants are called an@@ ew .
this property combines various players with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president wishes .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for exc@@ it@@ ement .
if he ex@@ presses an alien host@@ ility for journalists or knowledge g@@ aps in international crisis politics . the candidate for the US presidential office is plan@@ ed through the elec@@ toral struggle .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the p@@ fäl@@ ische K@@ all@@ stadt , 42 million people from the property .
the New Yorker , describing the &apos; tor@@ so &apos; fell in the win@@ dy village on the Wein@@ straße .
man@@ cher in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants spot is related to sp@@ icy facets with it .
his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaign .
the jewe@@ l of St. Wendel St. Wendel shot a movie about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about His destination , become the most powerful man of the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think you &apos;ll find the somewhat around , but they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no pro@@ found@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native of K@@ all@@ ap@@ ron has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous offspring , near Tr@@ ump also owns the Bo@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for fl@@ atten@@ ing , comes in the Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt , &quot; ( 2014 ) too , so with the statement that he would certainly have been successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ad@@ mit respect to the performance of the family , but also typically the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a bit like a giant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St. Wendel . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Tr@@ ump gets off , therefore , from the village of the geber .
the success story began in 1885 when the last father immig@@ rated to a place in the US and opened a local for gold dig@@ nit@@ aries in the USA .
beginning of the property enterprises were the first site of the property in New York .
but life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy . it was their wish to return to the home in homeland , def@@ ending to the Bavarian State where the Palat@@ inate was one .
he is not having qu@@ ir@@ oned , because he once approved without hom@@ ologation , he was director of the Institute of p@@ fäl@@ ische History and Ethno@@ graphy , Roland Paul , at the film start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ child of an &quot; illeg@@ itim@@ ate hi@@ on@@ ers &quot; .
this represents in contrast to the not@@ ice@@ ably below the follow @-@ up statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this repeatedly inter@@ cep@@ tible on Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a dam to strike illegal immigrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the pol@@ led , this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a separate conc@@ eit m@@ umps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , who Op@@ a was born @-@ up Heinz &apos; ) .
the wine that is retired from the Americans are more des@@ irable , &quot; he is always such . &quot;
do he believe that Tr@@ ump occur ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never dist@@ ressed about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension gains in Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm , such that a desc@@ endant of the church Heinz with a visit to the church , which ended generally well .
&quot; this can &apos;t think of the Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they ple@@ ad it better if he won &apos;t want the election , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radi@@ al views , I don &apos;t know if the good is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if they who had been working at the time of his grand@@ father in the US as he had been , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had never arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than it , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ der Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my President is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the woman in which Sam Wood in the Bachelor &apos;s blog finally got into business , has been env@@ elop@@ ed in largest intelligence .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not offer , if they are the one who received the last rose .
but as we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the Day , before three are taken out , you possibly gave a hint on it , who will be the winner .
Sam Wood has sealed his lips to the final on Thursday !
all three women have left over a spec@@ tly way , why Wood the perfect man is , and called his mind for hum@@ or , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they glad@@ ly want to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you who should get W@@ oods last rose ? , &quot; could their answers to game destro@@ yer , who won the heart of the brook .
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki they both quickly - apart from itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood from the first day have an easy relationship with each other .
&quot; from the moment when I went into house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and SAM@@ S renewable energies I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that in the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is at his feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun together with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together , and they &apos;ve got the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from its view@@ point , M@@ ack@@ ay said that during the hom@@ etown &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , I realized that this isn &apos;t just a game - I am un@@ moved on him , &quot; she said .
and when asked what they should choose , that they should not know it , then it was bar@@ ren .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jar@@ r@@ yd Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle resulted in great interest after moving to the U.S. and there were many other teams looking for an impressive day of training at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ b and it looks like a very reasonable decision .
some coach would have banned the rest of the game to the Bank as he had a few dark brown as it had said the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by @-@ League con@@ sen@@ ate in his first p@@ unt return on Tuesday in the 20 @-@ 3 victory of Minnesota .

in addition , Tom@@ b showed his true face in the changing cabin after the game .
rather , rather than his ro@@ ok@@ ies to grin@@ d the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
in his press conference , Tom@@ ic@@ ula strengthened himself in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ ly Final Fest , In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was encouraged and encouraged by Thomas Mc@@ G@@ aug@@ he@@ y , who encouraged him to take care of his lost ties and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ r@@ yd Hay@@ ne is coated with a p@@ unt , which was restored in the first quarter of Minnesota Vik@@ ings

Hay@@ ne was able to perform the shar@@ pen@@ er with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a pass taken at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area at a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .

the advantages of weight loss surgery for mild and overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say , whether more exc@@ essive people are longer living with diabetes in weight @-@ loss surgery than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; killing data require a long time to show something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote a report about the new study in j@@ ama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss - sur@@ geri@@ es or adi@@ pos@@ itas @-@ surgery use several methods to reduce the size of the magnetic .
reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to maintain food .
about the years O@@ bes@@ ity operations has proven to be efficient as efficient , but most studies were carried out in humans , with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BMI ) of 35 or above .
BMI , a certain measure in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and humans with a BMI of 30 are usually in ob@@ ese .
you can comp@@ ute your BMI : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan ( min ) Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have been collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obes@@ ity treatment - a number of medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily verified .
the average BMI of those who underwent surgery in operation was from 31 to 24@@ 9.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI is based on the not surgical diabetes treatment were approximately equal to 29 patients .
those who under@@ go surgical intervention was completely dissolved in 36 % of the disease @-@ disease and 28 % in part .
in the medical group , diabetes had been completely dissolved just by 2 percent in comparison with diabetes and in part at only about two percent .
Moreover , the results were carried out in the inspec@@ tions of blood pressure , the tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ ols &apos; in the generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also expressed the patient &apos;s blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects blood glucose levels in the course of time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level fell by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical treatment group there remained stable at around 8 percent .
but these better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic monitoring &quot; - as you reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not avoid mortality in five years , thus the chief physician Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su , and her colleagues .
as the result the team looked like the average results of the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gast@@ ric re@@ lie@@ u group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and reached greater dec@@ lines in BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and was rather a complete over@@ coming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit from surgery after five years , there are indications of a study serious people in Sweden , that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was in low @-@ life people , subjected to obes@@ ity operation , roughly 29 percent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared to a group , which tried to conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery @-@ patients , Black@@ stone said it &apos;s oo@@ thing for people with a BMI of 35 who are interested in the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is less high in the low BMI group &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; without an increased risk of death or a ren@@ al disease , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone has added that people and physi@@ cians should start weight loss as soon as the patient who have a BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait for a long time until we are able to take this serious , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once these genet@@ ically modified these genetic modifications that ur@@ ged the body with obes@@ ity and diabetes , is a revers@@ ed really hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story play in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
it is a theme that happens in the fiction : a young woman who is very popular and in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous , meets with years the flock of her youth , and this love has come in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roman &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published recently in recently we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel is mainly interesting for H@@ uns@@ wer@@ er readers , because he plays in Lang@@ we@@ iler and the surrounding settlements .

&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not im@@ press all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the true solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East might .
Tibetan Buddhist leaders asked to termin@@ ate the violence in the local countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of the refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech as compassion on the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which is devoted to eth@@ ics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances may be the interests of humanity , which should be challenged through the interests of the individual nations or even the continents .
he stressed that the response of West European countries in which refugee crisis is ad@@ mir@@ able , but the situation isn &apos;t reasonable .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
despite the Dalai Lama , Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to conquer the crisis , he stressed that there was only one temporary solution .
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long term solutions , as well as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education to be created for these Muslim countries . &quot; he stressed .
finally , we have to think about it , as the k@@ illings were reduced in their countries .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these issues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama repeated the problem of violence and commented as George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 and confirmed that the violent reaction of the USA attracted a chain of un@@ control@@ l@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my supplement in a letter to President Bush , and I told him , the way to the solution of this problem is in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his moti@@ fs were good , but he put violence , and that gave me more consequences &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase of consumption of slopes caused by children within the last 4 years
patient control centers in the United States have an almost 400 @-@ percent increase the number of children under twelve years , which is strongly advised by Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord L@@ op@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of hand@@ writing applications have increased in children under 12 years of age , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are often more common to those products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ op@@ ez CNN says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children det@@ erg@@ ents do , while some do they do to im@@ press her friends or because of a mut@@ ing for social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinfect@@ ant are suitable only because of a budget experience .
te@@ ens are allegedly mixed with alcohol containing soft oral water to preserve a har@@ der drink .
younger children can be gir@@ ded by attractive perf@@ umes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ op@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinfect@@ ant ) are those that are par@@ ked .
there are disinfect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange bl@@ urs , which are very appe@@ aling for children .
fl@@ ask equipment included somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly with infants , few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol in@@ tox@@ ication .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ emergency Center at the University of Kansas , station Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City .
so , you would have no so@@ ck whis@@ ky while whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand @-@ disinfect@@ ant in range of children , and if children get it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ ja Russell , a six year old girl , has recently taken four sy@@ ringe from after straw@@ berry du@@ ck lines in the school , has been brought to treat .
her blood alcohol concentrations have 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is insured in an adult , said Dr. Chris R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey , a not@@ ion doctor who bought it in the G@@ win@@ ier Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah inv@@ jah her words and was not able to go on when they arrived in the emergency when .
doctors said they over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , because the girl was fallen by alcohol and had be@@ fallen the head , said R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; he was very fri@@ gh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ ft@@ i Scott , of New York &apos;s mother , CNN .
it could have been le@@ thal for my child .
L@@ op@@ ez is recommended to use parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinfection products outside the baby &apos;s range .
about alcohol in@@ tox@@ ication , some disinfect@@ ants connected with deaths .
in 2013 two women in Ontario died for the closing of wall infection , which det@@ ects toxic and non @-@ clari@@ fied oil .
the employees of health authorities mar@@ es that the product me@@ thanol contained , a deadly solution instead of ethylene oxide , which was not@@ ated as active ingre@@ dient .
in January planned three students of the fourth class in the state of New York , their &quot; common &quot; teachers in for@@ ums , &quot; having issued anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; the report reports a police report .

there is rum@@ ors of Dish@@ ar@@ mon@@ y at Cel@@ tic Glasgow , which was spont@@ ane@@ ously removed by Griff@@ i@@ ths and were not under an elevated control , as they are preparing to prepare for the front@@ ation with the Dutch table heads .
I don &apos;t think we will feel under pressure I think that the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of cover competition in Scottish football , bo@@ red Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the ex @-@ ran@@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former National player from the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest to Cel@@ tic , since there are no title gi@@ val@@ ed in the ran@@ kings .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Cel@@ tic games anymore and why ? &quot;
it is because the man@@ eu@@ ers are not there .
people are not only talking about the return of the leaderboard .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they speak about both teams and that &apos;s interested in them .
there is a lot of voltage in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn the things around , swe@@ ars D@@ eil@@ a .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eil@@ a was accepted to fight Cel@@ tic , but Norwegian b@@ oss has to change things .
after the defeat against Malmö and the successive departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ men from Aberdeen , which is now represented by five points lead clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ eil@@ a said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had not earlier times , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know , it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry , or sad about what happened .
we feel exactly so - but we must go on .
we really need the Cel@@ tic &apos;s support , because that players gets better .
feeling together is so important .

the ex @-@ b@@ oss of Br@@ ent@@ ford says : &quot; the January transfer window is quite different from the summer window . &quot;
players who get in summer will have this pre @-@ season period to integrate that you have seen with our own group in this season .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while they in the UK overall rises .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in the period from May to July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole in the same period by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
stunning unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5,5 % as the numbers of national statistics for National Statistics ( ONS ) showed .
in the meantime the study has fallen in Scotland in around 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the number of employment for Scotland fell in the course of the quarter to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3,5 percent .
the state Secretary for Scotland David Bas@@ ell concluded the latest numbers and said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of government laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
during these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market to raise employment and a decline in unemployment .

why I &apos;ll be a witness in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
something later , except with a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is put to death .
if it happens , and I hope that it will not occur , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , if Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by le@@ thal injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was already for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day is approaching , I began to fear myself .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed to , because I thought it was a good way to tell all the story about the death penalty .
there would be a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and often more applicants can be made available as seats , a mak@@ eup of lot@@ tery to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who will be selected , the company will be observed in 2011 .
I cannot do that .
I will sit in addition to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps &apos;s smallest friend , with which I developed my own relationship over the course of months with telephone calls and an two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often have much , when we speak .
the prison could say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to capture a not@@ ebook and a pen to capture what I see .
I just need to try to remember anything .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of trying to aband@@ on my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell a story of a prisoner , how he wants it , and you &apos;ll get access .
I app@@ raise me with her .
she didn &apos;t think that &quot; it could have better phr@@ ased , &quot; but they still think it &apos;s wrong , what I do .
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had solved problems with some of the things I have said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I write to you , and I would not do it , even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses any time .
but he wants ke@@ en to present an international repor@@ ter , in order to write there .
when he dies , he considers the public relations work in movement to the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , listen to the series of Pod@@ casts , which I made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details .
I can not say with security that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would susp@@ end him a bene@@ fic@@ i@@ ent of fact .
but I believe that there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that it is not guilty of murder .
I think there is no sufficient evidence to just@@ ify a cause of death .
I believe that he is false .
and I shall die from this perspective .
I can not claim to be an objective .
there will be other rep@@ orter , to which you can turn on for it .
what you &apos;ll be given by me is what it means to die a man a unnecessary death .

Peter Moo@@ dy reports that stew@@ ards tried to fl@@ atten the ship and to end the racing
Peter Moo@@ dy said that the stew@@ ards of Racing Victoria tries to install a sp@@ y in his pe@@ eling first year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he collected on the stew@@ ards and the integration department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai on Wednesday to run the last stro@@ ker on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he is always trying to do what is best suited for racing , and he himself found himself under difficult conditions as it went to explain the positive co@@ b@@ alt blood sample at Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had held 18 months due to the sp@@ ying p@@ aus@@ age and didn &apos;t want to see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see how strong grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say nothing of it , and sometimes I have been fru@@ str@@ ated at all , and sometimes they are fru@@ str@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it departed .
sometimes you respon@@ ds , and you must live with the consequences , and I must live with it what I said .
I will tonight go home and sleep well .
I would no need to go about the head , and I wish that my owners think I will try my best for them .
if they begin to think I do not do it , then I should be no more coach .
I then have to think about what I do with my license .
earlier , Moo@@ dy had attracted the bomb in an interview with rac@@ usa that the quality department had tried to increase its stable .
&quot; over the age of eighteen months , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart was going into a room with a man - I &apos;m going to give him an employment in my st@@ ables , to deliver information about what I do in my st@@ alls , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ eway .
they seem to believe that I am a bet@@ wi@@ ger .
if that is the case , they should certainly hold their nose , because they try to receive me , because they have failed .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard K@@ H , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of its time and today are still alive today .
should I bring the opinion , that it is personally done ?
does the R@@ V@@ L do dar@@ n , and maybe people go outside of work , what do you proceed in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I simply so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think there is outside , so I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and off myself , and I don &apos;t have a doubt that what I say they can think of it now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I am now at that point that doesn &apos;t matter me , and that makes me sad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will exercise the pressure on them and dr@@ ushing it to make a decision .
I have complem@@ enting the support of my family and I can .

&quot; it is against the rules of racing sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I must take over full responsibility for this purpose , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees applied the strain on the ball for one of my staff .
it could have been the last night .
it could have been so yesterday the whole day that was how it was .
but it had also so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could to face a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation into this issue has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see a fact that we need rules , but here we go too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy carried out contrary to ri@@ vals to Ring@@ ve Her@@ oes
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ aire founded the cr@@ isp@@ ling of his player as &quot; Agenda &quot; Set@@ ting &quot; from two Premier League in Favor@@ ites .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Robinson revealed that the sole of the Storm @-@ players &quot; fighting broke out in Sydney on Friday evening with his team during the high @-@ Storm victory of the Storm @-@ Champion in Sydney .
Brisbane Bron@@ co Trainer Roth Bennett was hardly climbed to the Storm team after his team had reached the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he named the game a &quot; sample example of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land won &apos;t be &quot; good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ ingham def@@ ended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ b of his team and said that she only concentrated on its &quot; contact &quot; in the T@@ ack@@ ling .
Bell@@ amy added that the cr@@ iti@@ que of two leading women in his team are confident that , since it was sorry that they had not wor@@ ried , from the CM @-@ Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this always appeared - I didn &apos;t hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson gave a combined heat , when they defeated them 24 : 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed every year in our defective system or techniques . but in the last six weeks we made our contact with t@@ ack@@ les , and this has produced for us the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years , and he obviously has a great team to exercise . he is therefore probably not to lose himself am@@ per@@ ed , so it was a little bit more shock with him .
it is strange that this season is moving again to this season .
Bell@@ amy presented the idea of the &quot; exciting football &quot; and rec@@ alls its ment@@ or , that Ben@@ net@@ ts St George Il@@ grat@@ war@@ ra D@@ RA@@ G@@ ONS won the Premier League in 2010 with a &quot; slow football . &quot;
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he finished his game on Saturday evening with our evening on Friday evening and as exciting &#91; her play was , &quot; Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a bor@@ ing team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and play it as exciting , in particular its young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you &apos;ve lear@@ nt those kind of players .
he made this testimony in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , for they can play like those .
I build this stronger faith because they speak these things because they are a bit wor@@ ried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they don &apos;t have thought about us when it went to the big Games .
Bell@@ amy also proved that the Storm Against Roo@@ ster is higher than the game of Bron@@ co against C@@ ow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ co was probably a good game I haven &apos;t seen it , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts in the game but it &apos;s an exciting game ?
or do p@@ auses do and keep any points of ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
for me it are the ti@@ met@@ ables .
if they report to us , it means that we will hit the stage again in one phase .
the CM @-@ team is free at this weekend while they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks next Saturday night in the final of the A@@ AM@@ I park . ticket sales starts off the next service tomorrow .
burn down to $ 200,000 deposit against drug cl@@ amp@@ es
a man who may be a life of life threat@@ ens due to his su@@ cking , in the possession of 40 kilograms Kok@@ ain , who were swe@@ pt into Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a cau@@ tion of $ 200,000 .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested the last month after police sp@@ s 100 kg was found on the yacht slot that was found in South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he was superior to his co @-@ def@@ endants within the mor@@ nings and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly life sentence for the attempt , a commercial success of Kok@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , argu@@ ed that there is no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that at café in a harm@@ less reason .
the judges at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of the risk of mac@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the Court on Wednesday .
in case of pen@@ alties , he reported the police over his residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and st@@ ep@@ father had offered a security bond of 200,000 dollars as security together to help his release .
&quot; after reading the ei@@ stic statements of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a true financial burden , &quot; said Judge Flan@@ agan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this alone won &apos;t be enough to release him , not to appear , he warned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released by cau@@ tion damage , under the conditions that he returns to his Australian and Serbian passport , and if the police stopped daily from 18 : 00 to 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to cur@@ l ped@@ oph@@ ile to sending images
a educ@@ ator used the phone in a 11 @-@ year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g recorded the phone from the girl as this as@@ le@@ ep , log@@ ged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of un@@ stable images of children who were sent to him from another user .
the girl re @-@ awak@@ ened later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she looked through her , found the conf@@ using messages and al@@ po@@ orer immediately her mother .
the police freed yesterday and saw the five pictures , analyzed the computer that were found under the address , and discovered the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; web research search phr@@ ases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in question for the search for non @-@ permanent images of children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed that he had done it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ilia in the internet would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be a polic@@ eman bo@@ omed to fri@@ gh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Spanish so@@ lic@@ itor C@@ eri@@ h Robertson , the President of the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court said : &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ dic@@ tive to be happy to fri@@ gh@@ ten people .
he admitted that sear@@ ches were carried out on the computer of him , but he said it would be done , because he asser@@ t his polic@@ eman to be ped@@ oph@@ ile to be ped@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked for his convers@@ ations with the un@@ familiar person who sent out the pictures and asked him to send more photos more pictures .
he told that he did so to temp@@ t her .
he said he was sick in his head , when he drinks , and said he would like to watch pictures of rape and murder .
MS Robertson , he was added : &quot; when the girl was found on the phone , she called her mother and was on the trem@@ or and at the weeping .
this then looked the in@@ consistent images on the phone and con@@ fron@@ ted the def@@ endants .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused appe@@ aled computers and Play@@ station to talk to girls who were younger than he was younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , found guilty in accordance with the indictment , have made permanent images of children on 14 June this year , and not before the court of a hearing on 24 March this year appeared .
Defense &apos;s lawyer Gregor S@@ im desired that H@@ og@@ g doesn &apos;t appear in the register of sexual off@@ ences , as they argu@@ ed that &quot; there is no considerable sexual element &quot; in his mind .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael sent the sentence until October to obtain background reports about social work .
H@@ og@@ g was given a cau@@ tion given in this case , but was held in provisional pending cases of other pending cases .
he was still accepted before the date of the judgment to the directory of sexual crimes .
Schle@@ users sp@@ lines on small border processes in Germany
and more refugees continue to be taken away from the German @-@ Austrian border .
many of the visitors came from fear and arrest , multiple involvement in smaller borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the Austrian page , a Sp@@ ok@@ es@@ person of the Federal Police comes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
along the bound@@ ary river Inn , in the Land@@ kreise of Passau and R@@ ott@@ al @-@ Inn , more than 1,000 refugees were taken up .

Stuttgart : highlights of the tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest of England
meteor@@ ologists war@@ ns against pet@@ itions in the Sou@@ thwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure from western Europe , warm ocean air in the country b@@ lows far country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart .
the vig@@ orous wa@@ ver@@ ing is the gri@@ pping of the storm &quot; Henry , &quot; who held the Atlantic of the Atlantic in the past few days .

on Friday night the sun is definitely looking back .
the mass makes it : every two years the car will show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
2015 primarily were the possibilities of the compact car to sell very well .
cars from the compact class are currently being question@@ able : around 28@@ .1 percent of new registrations accounted for by the Federal Office of the Federal Office ( KBA ) in August alone in August of this segment .
this is also reflected at the International Motor Show ( Audi@@ ence stage 17 to 27 September ) .
in particular , many new compact models were presented between the fut@@ ur@@ istic concepts and new luxury cars in this year .
one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German automobile industry is the Opel Astra when it is available to dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model in us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann to the fair .
he belongs to the core of the brand .
when the Astra &apos;s volume is well @-@ sold , the new Astra is also not much more expensive .
Opel is starting one of the biggest compet@@ itor VW Golf in Vista , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra takes from 16 990 Euro .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen @-@ Diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp also offer three @-@ cylinder petrol engines in the world .
unlike the major compet@@ itor of the VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially merely five @-@ fifth .
a second variation will follow in spring of the com@@ bi which is already visible at the IAA .
and what will the Astra only drove to new compact cars next to the Astra ?
Renault Gr@@ ind e : Renault is launching the fourth generation of its Astra to its race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the fair , the Mé@@ dioc@@ e is exclusively visible as a fifth person in a conventional and an under@@ stand@@ able GT version . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be available in the world for the beginning of next year , then as a station wagon .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the new segment the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30
the Nissan @-@ boom wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti offers its curved lines fully integrated into the line of the brand .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with a power output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
however on offer , the offer is also a diesel of 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : another in the same segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo@@ charged engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 Nm ( Nm ) according to the manufacturer &apos;s torque .
the start of sales in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : completely new , but completely renewed , the compact class DS 4 Compact which is to be seen at the IAA .
the designer of the noble Citroën @-@ Ab@@ e. placed especially in front of the front end . here the radiator gr@@ ille was newly painted and the head@@ lights with LED technology has been refurbished .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was mainly moderni@@ zed , reduced the number of buttons through a touchscreen and re @-@ designed for the first Apple Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play .
on the IAA in the compact class we add a number of work@@ ings and new varieties such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are de@@ classified
the Federal Constitutional Court delivered a former in@@ mate of the Federal Ministry of Justice of Te@@ gel , which was housed in a few small cell months .
due to the violation of their human rights , you are entitled to compens@@ ate for financial compensation when they are accommodated in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
the person concerned can even burn the judges to save money , if they were both locked and locked in close rooms for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
this was an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee , with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe , Germany : it was housed in an external environment at Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 , having a separate living room with around five square meters of floor area ; the toilet was not separated .
afterwards the man who according to his An@@ wal@@ let was now restored in an un@@ le@@ aded foot , to a bigger cell .
his detention leg@@ alization due to the un@@ ob@@ taining contrac@@ ting conditions against the land Berlin fail .
however the constitutional complaints against the chamber of the chamber of Berlin came to and drove the case to ren@@ ew it there .
you see the man &apos;s bones got injured .
Chamber Court now decides over the amount of compensation
also if the legal reasons for the time period , only a few days release time for the compensation occurred , be a compensation , called it .
otherwise , &quot; a must @-@ cause of the legal protection of the personality could be feared . &quot;
the Chamber Court should now clari@@ fy the amount of the money .
the constitutional complaint often strengthened the rights of prisoners of worship in the past .
so said they said first in April a prisoner of damages , because he was imprisoned in a cell in prison .
human un@@ worthy is a ruling by 2011 even the multi@@ single occupancy of one cell without a separate toilet .
Moreover , on Wednesday , alongside an in@@ mate , a prisoner &apos;s court , Karlsruhe , confirmed a de@@ cent housing on Wednesday in November 2009 .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs was accommodated three months of the time in a homogen@@ ous cell , as in the Karls@@ bad case , from 15 to 21 hours .
the Berlin Sec@@ ession went on strike in the past few weeks , too because of lack of staff .
cap@@ tives &quot; cap@@ tives are kept back for 23 hours , and the aggres@@ si@@ vity also rising to the end of the attack on account of the victims .
according to the direction of Justice , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to lack of young creation , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we &apos;re getting the &quot;
the migration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
according to the president &apos;s forecasts , approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will be coming to Germany . according to the president of Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to receive one million refugees .
ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we can do it . &quot;
what comes in Germany , gives the following overview .
this shall be used according to various forecasts between 3@@ 50000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Education ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ o Institute ) annually - throughout the next five years .
that is almost twice as much as ever is building ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is but above all at affordable rental objects : every year 600@@ 00 @-@ 800@@ 00 social apartments delivered out of the lease @-@ binding hotel and in order to apply for these particularly favourable apartments .
the Federal Building Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) will therefore double the promotion , from $ 518 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the perspective of the Pest@@ o Institute : 80 000 Social actors per year would need to spend an annual funding of € 6.4 billion per year .
scientists and the Federal Minister for Building , in fact , scientists have also necessary to give more tax advantages for investment in residential buildings .
according to estim@@ ations of the institute for employment and professional research , some of the long @-@ term 55 % of the farmers in Germany can be employed .
however , in Germany , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked after their quali@@ fications to help them with the entry , critic@@ ises Claudia Walter , the project manager for the integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but it is crucial for the integration of refugees , but it is crucial to work in Germany .
labour is the key to social contacts , but for the value assessment in the admission application , but also for the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em of the migrants , &quot; Mig@@ ration@@ for@@ er Dietrich Thr@@ vor@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Tab@@ ern@@ hardt , a political change has been given : from the prohibition of labour for refugees in recognition of work .
while a labour ban for asylum seek@@ ers has been from up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence beam , the asylum seek@@ ers will be limited to a residence .
in society , too , despite the po@@ ison@@ ous sp@@ as@@ bread - largely excell@@ ently in the way that refugees should be faster to access to the labour market .
a big hur@@ dle in the access to the labour market are lack of German .
until now , there is no sufficient creative offer on general and professional @-@ related language courses .
research also show that jobs can be arranged in personal contacts through personal contacts .
this is why the building of a network is therefore based on the rec@@ ycle of the Königs@@ Way to Industrial Integration .
the Berlin school Administration has found that only a few vol@@ at@@ ile parents give their children in the Kit@@ as , estimated by ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ ro@@ oted parents , it is only important to say the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ ad , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nevertheless from the advantages of the K@@ ita , management bu@@ ret@@ ards in different languages .
should the need of educ@@ ators have strong increases severely due to the big number of refugees , the Berlin Senate will try to increase the training capacity until some , by generating more specialised schools .
students will be prepared in the following classes with no German knowledge in welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by teachers and teachers , as well as in Berlin , as well as teachers who are only one qualification in German as a second language .
we suggest no lack of remarks concerning the Berlin School of Economics .
the German Student Union estimates that about 20 percent of those in Germany want to study in Germany .
in principle there is no state asylum seek@@ ers or the intended trial - the only exception was previously Berlin , Wi@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank &apos;s ( CD@@ U ) but abandoned its position as well .
academic refugees might be facilit@@ ated by the University of the university .
for refugees in a cur@@ ial or Dul@@ ce do not receive any services based on the seek@@ ers of the law more if they start studying .
the latter is not given in principle , as they fall not in the circle of b@@ af@@ aring persons .
Ged@@ il@@ ted refugees had to continue to have lived four years in Germany to have been authorised of being b@@ af@@ o@@ grams , and this range will be shortened to 15 months from January 1 , 2016 .
but this financing needs must be closed , but Steffen Kra@@ k , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Student Union .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ o@@ g .
Islam will in future be a more important role , because many refugees belong to Muslims , and for many , the majority is an important part of its identity .
the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely affect the same rights as they have the churches , and to develop the existing state ch@@ urch@@ s rights to a new state @-@ religi@@ ons relationship .
it also would be important to the formation of a Islamic re@@ char@@ ist who take care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
rights are also duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam has to be clear and ready to work with the state in many areas and to clean up certain control options .
to this purpose , the read@@ iness to take you to take their lives against religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ dr@@ k , expressed the concern of concern , religious conflicts could be entered into Germany .
those who wanted to conflict such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately left their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law of arab@@ ic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will be much more than today a topic around the whole society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the majority society has to change , the destruction of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be ur@@ gent .
Germany - as a result of European decisions , one anti @-@ discrimination law and a general principle of equality has been issued since a close decade .
but it were all learning very slowly , like the NSU m@@ ord@@ o show , in the police and government no@@ ig@@ no@@ red the rac@@ ist topic systematically .
the same chances for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and stak@@ eholder groups are already under@@ going to call for international agreements , such as anti @-@ violence in Germany , must remain peaceful in the next years , if the country shall remain peaceful and popul@@ ate their new people - for the benefit of all .
it was generally not able to treat thousands of people expected to take part in the needs of refugees , who was President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery as previously expected .
&quot; what concern regarding management and capacity , we do this , &quot; said it to the daily mirror .
points that additional money in the system are to come .
Mont@@ gom@@ ery , gave orders to prevent bott@@ len@@ ecks , protect all of the crimes against regist@@ ers with the registration of healthcare .
performances could be reck@@ oned to federal states later .
and in the long term it was highly dis@@ able to control as many people with the limited service tool that pre @-@ evaluated the seek@@ ers of asylum .
otherwise , the doctors perform in favour of getting the language barri@@ ers .
even so far , based on childhood , the Berlin Health Institute The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that immigrants origin@@ ating well than their disease than other patients .
not only in clinics , including in medical practices , interpre@@ ting may need for interpre@@ ting them .
supporting many refugees but also with more general medical consultations in the emergency currency @-@ out tests .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee diseases , approximately , it would give clear more un@@ qualified disabilities , and among the young people , it is about HIV recon@@ n@@ aissance .
German physi@@ cians will seem to be faced by the Mont@@ gom@@ ery images that have been taken part of the course with other diseases of illness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ itic fall or tuber@@ culosis is not that difficult to identify . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the anger of the anger wouldn &apos;t even allow a relief after the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians had a highly advanced educational system , some refugees to employ even doctors .
in order to practice together , they would have to re@@ prove their quali@@ fications , if possible re@@ am@@ end the inspec@@ tions .
at least half of the refugees in Germany , according to the Federal Psycho@@ therap@@ ist ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) , it is ill . the majority of them suffer from post @-@ traum@@ atic load disorder or less depression .
especially viol@@ ate the refugee camps , procla@@ im Dietrich Mun@@ z , Chairman of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent study of TU München was announced that each fifth Syrian refugee kids is traum@@ ati@@ zed in Germany .
who is associated with a post @-@ traum@@ atic load disorder , that is , amongst others , with breathing difficulties with bre@@ aching , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart v@@ ases and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration camps , strong cur@@ ri@@ val@@ ence and emotional increases .
in order to prevent symptoms of chronic ob@@ ese , it was necessary due to early treatment , explained Mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of psych@@ ic dise@@ ased refugees has been given an psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can represent an application for psycho@@ therapy , but usually the treatment usually lasts several months .
Moreover , in the social offices , mostly property workers or doctors who have not trained for mental illness , whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mal@@ inv@@ alu@@ ation , says Mun@@ z .

&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current management stages .
already for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been around with the family &apos;s hands .
the gift to the cap@@ tiv@@ ating family is the family so in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very important to take up people of her everyday life and take them for two hours in a completely different world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior team . &quot; &quot; &quot;

every strike @-@ unit consists of some 80 animals from five different continents .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ated artists &quot; as she can love lov@@ ingly called , at the possibility of any request from the eyes .
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
does the animal cannot feel well , it will not be in the arena .
the most important commandment thus : good for animals .

FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb after the past Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
W@@ enger was stressed vs. Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation have been under plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss the next four games for England and , in view of its history , his participation is still un@@ certain in the next summer .
the great dis@@ grace of this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had its final season after a separate ank@@ le battery again and then returned to its old tail during the summer season .
&quot; this type of injury is not threatened the career , &quot; said W@@ enger .
there is one bone , that not healed .
this is no the case .
this was only an accident .
it was not in combination with his an@@ kl@@ es or the injuries which he had before .
this may be true from p@@ urely medical point of view , but as indicated also , there is the associated risk of further injuries , always if a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it is also an un@@ pleasant pattern .
the examination of Prime Minister In@@ jur@@ ies Ltd has recorded 23 different disorders of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
it also played 157 Lig@@ uria in just 65 out of Ar@@ sen@@ a 157 Lig@@ uria .
the bro@@ ader enlarged picture of Arsenal actually took place in six of eight play times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League Clubs and most of the po@@ aching days have been recorded .
more closely accepts the potential of a devil , but Arsenal means that an improvement in the injury rate during the last season will last .
&quot; sometimes if you come from an injury , you have a vulner@@ able period , a time in which you must strengthen your body and combat physical for@@ mar@@ tial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome the world .
I hope his body is stabil@@ ized , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the art that he deser@@ ved .
Arsenal begins his Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ track on Wednesday , and W@@ enger had a rotation among the teams .
H@@ é@@ on Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not left for Croatia , which means that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ uch@@ y and Art@@ eta will be advised .
W@@ enger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it , a little breathing @-@ pause , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although they are fortun@@ ate , managed by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most in@@ breeding effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; un@@ sealed &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday , where it was measured on the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
in close , in opinion , Arsenal had pulled the teaching from last season with the Champions League @-@ surrender with Monaco , and left the remote hope to lead the association to his first European yo@@ del triumph .
&quot; this drive is imm@@ en@@ sely , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it has never been opened with Arsenal .
we were in the year 2006 very close to me , but on the other side I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are stri@@ pped , but we are not dre@@ amer .
friendship Festival : the com@@ edy show that we serious lessons has made serious discussions on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the lack of similar shows in shows is obvious , especially in terms of how to open the need for men to open , now even more des@@ per@@ ate than ever before , in young men on a 15 @-@ year high @-@ och .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of men in men at the age of 20 to 45 , and it remains more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , Camp@@ a@@ ign Against The Living ( CA@@ LM campaign against a inher@@ ited life ) announced the year of a man with the aim to ask culture in question whether they are not seeking to seek assistance if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
a current study carried out at more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ pressed symptoms , that when the suff@@ erer had a suff@@ ici@@ ently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; had its chances of recovery .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritual healthy individuals increases the risks of mental problems .
but of course , one has to have only friends , so a friendship can work .
in the age of social media , communication , with its focus on design , the response is often more important than an important to contact .
our digital life have the need to appear strong , cheer@@ ful and effectively , even if it is dominated in reality .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologist ex@@ tr@@ ins@@ om@@ ic values : money , image , social status , everything at cost in@@ trin@@ sic values . our inner vision is searching for personal development and friendship , which effect on our mental health is a lot of pro@@ found .
and how a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire explained , money can really buy any luck .
the beauty of Friends was that this foc@@ us@@ sing on the head was raised .
each character was not defined by his work but by his personality , which weak@@ ened by the interaction as friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent h@@ ugs , moments away with foot@@ notes in cozy bo@@ ilers and the lon@@ ging by Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that males can refer definitely , even if they often go back to explore fully their feelings .
as a staff of telephone calls it said to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my in@@ audi@@ ble roller for people who are de@@ pressed and self @-@ vulner@@ able to me , showed me a difference to the smallest inter@@ actions of friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us is often not able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old Rede@@ mp@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness , if you don &apos;t talk about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
music is one of the shows that comes in my mind when I try to offer long @-@ term reliability mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
thus , my objective outcome of out@@ si@@ ders will help human beings to examine the desp@@ air and the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you go on this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ ship with which to celebrate the day completely redesigned setting , why do not take your friends at a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , better , if you &apos;re sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone , give it a smile and say hello to you .
one never knows what difference to your friendship could make .
friends is broadcast at Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ ship Festival
di Maria meets the PS@@ G to help the Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after a hits of Malmö .
during his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and PS@@ G , the Champions League kick@@ ed @-@ off at Malmö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani ste@@ ep@@ ed as a Paris Saint @-@ Germain its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park @-@ stadium on Tuesday .
in less than four minutes after the start of the Champions League de@@ but@@ s as PS@@ G , which brought the French champion on the way , but afterwards she restri@@ ct a number of occasions , before it increased its Vorsprung durch Technik .
with Real Madrid and chim@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in the group A needs Paris a strong start against the Swedish champion , as it is not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ marathon , but also an improvement on the road to the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they had received the points , there was no classical game by Laurent Bl@@ anc@@ &apos;s team with z@@ lat@@ in Ibra@@ him@@ ov@@ ics Ibra@@ him@@ pas@@ ić . he was later dra@@ fted in the game against his birth@@ place team and against the association , with whom he revi@@ ved his har@@ kens career already in 1999 .
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or ward in the Champions League . hence , it is a good start , 2 : 0 to gain our opponents , even if there are certain things we must f@@ ect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we have won , though I am sorry that we didn &apos;t even have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the first minute pas@@ him@@ ovic returned to Paris @-@ Team , which was taken on the weekend a 2 : 2 Un@@ lock on its own place towards Bordeaux in the first league , but was extinct in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argentin@@ ean wing imp@@ eller was called the one of the PS@@ G to join the next level in Europe , and he interpreted , why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malmö defense , before he finished trying to enter into the long corner of the network .
though , som@@ ebody said that PS@@ G would win a big victory , he was disappointed .
Malmö , the Cel@@ tic won in an Play @-@ off to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine nation@@ alities on the field , and had a five @-@ man @-@ attack and two deep in the middle range is a difficult opponent .
but besides a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , the dominant position in Kevin &apos;s P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , it pe@@ eled little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G gave themselves on , with some mal@@ off@@ sets and bad cancellation , not least from Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , who was not least than five attempts in the first half and then abandoned after it had deployed after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless , he too much more fortun@@ es when he gave his opponent in play , and it was a pass from Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , who was buried in a shot , from Wil@@ derness at the 5@@ 2nd minute at the P@@ fo@@ sten fortress ...
the second goal was finally reached shortly after the pen@@ guin live brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . at Uruguay he achieved his sixth victory , which Ibra@@ him@@ ovic was found a left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well .
it has ended all the idea that Malmö came in the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz before fixing the order of Ez@@ ech@@ zzi Lav@@ e@@ zzi can cut a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malmö , Age har@@ ei@@ de decided that PS@@ G had played a class on his team , and the Norwegian journalists said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last December last year .
since then , we have played only in the Swedish League , which has not the same level .
the qualification is not enough . &quot;
hat from before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

matt Dam@@ on con@@ fron@@ ted the af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican film maker Eff@@ ie Brown in discussion about the diversity and said it will not be needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actors Brown , stressed the need for alternative perspectives , was in reference to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists during the selected block of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , you can do it in the occupation of the film and not during the occupation of the show , &quot; secured Dam@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted , with offensive un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HO@@ O ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor arrived at The Mar@@ ti@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the industry &apos;s donation , Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and Far@@ ad@@ ly brothers , to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to think about to think about it - whoever will also be the director - as she did the figure of Harmony , &quot; said Brown first .
the only black person , and it is a N@@ ut@@ te , struck by their white hal@@ ves .
the name of the island of De@@ er White People is because of the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for his direc@@ ting &apos;s rights to the film ; Dam@@ on points that their direc@@ ts could give us something we could not want . &quot;

after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown has put in 2014 through a white polic@@ emen , the Black Li@@ ves movement added a nationwide impact and judicial measures against coloured inter@@ actions .
in February , the singer Prince mentioned an extension to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year during the Grammy Awards .
&quot; album quiet matter , &quot; ( albums still has their significance ) he said .
both books and black life , albums still have their significance .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves movement have published a statement in response , namely a reaction to the issue of Fox News Leader Elisabeth H@@ assel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered as a H@@ ass group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was based on a list of Enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ er@@ pillar , who will be invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .

so totally ... how I can &apos;t even imagine what this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed has continued with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter , to discuss the finals and why Brit@@ ten , although he finished the first at all , not any money award .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , it is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the fastest time &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much the money is a wonderful price and the life changed , it receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .

Detroit Tig@@ ers Lo@@ cated on Minnesota &apos;s stup@@ s
MIN@@ NE@@ HE@@ IN@@ IS@@ --@@ the second half of the season was for the Detroit Tig@@ ers not very funny . specially ...
once before they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tiger was in the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this role on Tuesday perfect to Minnesota &apos;s with 5 @-@ 4 of Target @-@ Field .

Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) stroke the sixth time in the 1 / 3 leg and made three asp@@ iring .
it wasn &apos;t his third successful start in his final nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in bul@@ l@@ do@@ ble every game , and therefore I want to be concentr@@ ating particularly in the game .
the designated tiger @-@ h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first thre@@ e@@ fied game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits for the Seattle of the Seattle on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has turned out the fire@@ wood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked well along the ( drums ) , saw not@@ ice@@ ably better in the bul@@ l@@ do@@ b , and he brought it directly into the game .
at the end of the seventh position at the end of the seventh life , Twin@@ s had their best chance to come back into the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning by a double on the left hand side .
bright F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a colorful , and Simon brought his second B@@ eman Brian Do@@ cker to Stri@@ ke@@ out before it was replaced by the Bla@@ ise Hard@@ y &apos;s Link@@ sh@@ al Hard@@ y Hard@@ y .
Hard@@ y survived wall , the only man , with whom he was con@@ fron@@ ted in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ cor@@ er Miguel S@@ ano , who had a Two @-@ Run special re@@ covering .
with a pair of L@@ ists and the closing event in the second brought the third B@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the Major League for the 27 occasions in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed a double play .

Rome has now a Martin Luther @-@ Platz
nearly 500 years after the Reformation , a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz is now there .
on Wednesday , the presence of St. Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino has been baptized an so @-@ known place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill on the names of the German Re@@ forms .
at the Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now honoured as &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is in the middle of the old Rome , beside the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name was applied for the church community of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , past@@ or of the Evangelical Lutheran congregation in Rome , rec@@ alled that the Protest@@ ants were often living in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries as a minority only in secret their faith .
in the symbolic terms , there is no visible way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) , as a young person of August@@ in@@ breeding , Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stood at Rome for a period of months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a come into sin .

hammer Fantasy last three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the gold @-@ plated ( gold @-@ plated ) is one of the haupt@@ werke , the Ot@@ mar Alt in his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ Mail has updated the adoption and content texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible which has now been published with magnificent pictures now .
it was the beginning of the painting for Ot@@ mar Alt , which in 150 different moti@@ ves put his personal consider@@ ations in biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colors and imag@@ in@@ ative variations made the 75 year old - but this means no means of face it with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mer@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : the respective topics can be taken , it is possible to act perfectly .
for three years , he worked in his bi@@ ble project for which he met a sub@@ jective &quot; artistic selection from the many different topics of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
there are cycles that are dedicated to topics like cross @-@ s@@ ations , pl@@ agues , commandments or pat@@ ern@@ ity .
so that he has been involved with several partners : this applies to the Luther publishing company with his the@@ ological alignment , as well as the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art books .
and there is mainly the author Klaus Al@@ te@@ Mail , based on the basis of painting with the respective movements .
he interpreted the movements from Ot@@ mar with selected Bible verses and &quot; transl@@ ating into current comp@@ action . &quot;
these lyrics are shown as verb@@ al mirror of al@@ ts painting .
these differences from the original Bible study by Martin Luther and in each case of the artist , who form@@ ulates his personal thoughts regarding the relevant situation .
the jewe@@ l is made with gold letters .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows double a deep insight into his life , his emot@@ ions .
that is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emot@@ ions finally were even born in the Bible for the Bible : Ot@@ mar - born in 1940 in Wer@@ n@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , coming from a family devoted to the strict Protestant ruling .
&quot; there is the up@@ bringing again with the rest of the earth , &quot; Ot@@ mar &quot; looks like young people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to set up the stage again , in order to also bear me with the Lord his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; his second suit was to say the art in faster time again to more importance : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perc@@ ei@@ ving the imag@@ ery is stamped &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , and that is loud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sym@@ bo@@ lic is ou@@ sted there .
artists have another desire and delight to find things .
pictures have always something specific and are not decorative .
in this regard , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would like to leave the viewer in the images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to work in themselves , discover and feel that power gives them : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image looks for himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Al@@ te@@ Post stood and Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; still &quot; had been &quot; an lovers of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like what he under@@ stands with his pictures &quot; .
( I &apos;m not respec@@ t@@ ful to fully capture the Bible , but which are important for him , even mysterious topics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not the cooperation of the eye , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the pictures of the images as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only developed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler by Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to finding &quot; his life &quot; deep and freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for girls alike ( the biblical ) language of love as well as responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on 15th November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still clear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there should be without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further tru@@ ce &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; started with the works by former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commit@@ ments for refugees
the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees until 2019 , with the Bundesliga a clear sign .
in Germany , the football respon@@ ds to itself a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art situation in Germany and sec@@ ures his assistance to move the relevant issues .
&quot; I think it is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in the principle , that &apos;s nothing , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interested in every thing in the handle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ B @-@ b@@ oss Rudolf K@@ R@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on 23 September he will inten@@ sively negoti@@ ate the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I &apos;m next Wednesday in the Chancellor &apos;s office and meet the German Minister of State Women O@@ lev@@ o@@ uz and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; tomorrow the theme will play a central role , &quot; he announced .
football can help and produce them .
but the decisive turn@@ outs must state the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association therefore has today raised its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to four years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; via the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung , we have ensured that this program runs until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said ren@@ s@@ bach on the fr@@ inge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German pav@@ ements also support this program .
this weekend , 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ ts set a clear sign when they go on the left tri@@ k@@ ot@@ ok@@ er instead of the usual sponsor of Euro@@ logos ( Hermes ) : we will help the over@@ print &quot; We are to carry &apos; # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make clear that all they may help , and how they can only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sport@@ sman at Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler ( Tuesday ) told the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ assurance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama continues everyone , and nobody can see it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot use soccer team , no , we must use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help many refugees who already have so incredibly successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ our@@ hei@@ ms managing director Peter Ret@@ tig said with a &quot; well @-@ known sign of the league . &quot;
for this Friday , the national team of women and women now invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale to attend this Friday .
Nier@@ s@@ bach perceived the support of refugees as a &quot; large community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 licens@@ ors had started his own projects in their places it was overwhelming .
likewise great , small and smallest associations are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which we spent is practi@@ ced in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this and next year the association will be helping together with DF@@ B selection and the federal government providing 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have called the whole sum of 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported ren@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t commonly imp@@ lied between Germany and the USA , but since the summer of summer he was no longer working in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it may be important to go to the public with such a personal story , said the manager &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen very anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

rob@@ ot@@ ics : government wants to be a pione@@ ering soldier for Germany
after the will of the federal government , Germany should be an technological leader in the field of cars .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday to set a strategy paper from the house of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which provides investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke at Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ fair IAA in a &quot; new mobile age . &quot;
the automated , networked system will increase traffic safety and provide less st@@ ems , said Do@@ d@@ dt .
he intends to discuss the subject also with his counter@@ part , the G7 states , bringing together representatives of the industry .
the strategy document of the Ministry of Transport is under@@ lines the importance of the mobile broad@@ band trans@@ lat@@ ex system and an easy re@@ leg@@ ation on digital radio .
the testing new technology currently produces a test line on Highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will discuss the legal framework conditions in order to adjust to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , Germany wants to use it for example , that the maximum permissible speed for self @-@ driving cars is raised from 10 to 130 km / h .
also in addition , the Federal Government wants to deplo@@ y the Vien@@ nese Convention , to date , to date only the people as driver .
when automated driving takes over in increasing measures the car takes the lead , the driver will be more and more to passenger .
the technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a research conducted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , drivers still be at public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to expect very far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the company @-@ automated driving functions are benef@@ iting from the study by 2025 to approx . 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the P@@ k@@ ws &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; connectivity can lead to more security and efficiency in road traffic &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said SPD S@@ ör@@ en Bart@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the issue of liability in accidents and security of the personal data of the driver must be clari@@ fied .
still the German self @-@ prop@@ ag@@ ating cars however sc@@ ep@@ tical - much more than the French or Americans .
one on Wednesday at the AA presented survey of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the Testing Laboratory of DE@@ K@@ RA come to the result that only eight percent of Germany believe that self @-@ risk of cars should be observed in the coming ten years , 32 percent do not expect in 20 years to believe , 31 percent do not believe in it .
in France , 21 percent of those survey@@ ed by 2025 are attributable to autonomous driving cars , in the US 33 percent .
the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to leave their self @-@ driving vehicle .
after raising the digital ban on Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would be true , control throughout the trip on all roads .
the traffic could be at least 15 percent in traffic @-@ flowing traffic , in the stag@@ nation year 45 percent .
in good morning , the car would not leave the control under any circumstances .

&quot; the guys were experienced in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are strongly enough to pick up the title without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal President Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM @-@ course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who establishes the time @-@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , rec@@ alled the chat time at the time of EM in 2013 .
&quot; he got a thing at that time , and we became European champion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by this we should ori@@ ent ourselves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the world tran@@ scription . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United has decided to have a heavy injury on the right leg .

Gaul@@ tier feels to become old for an end .
it is a blend of very great fashion show and a wax figures : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) showed an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ nequ@@ ins , fully de@@ w@@ ed because of video projection .
they bear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , which was among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as Stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and there@@ with , that he put men in co@@ ats .
&quot; I can &apos;t say today that I am the end of the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it was not easy , since today it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Austria &apos;s plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From citizens ) , which was on the 18th of September in the Kunsth@@ alle of the hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is a good fortune to have changed his first dis@@ cour@@ ageous attitude to a vision of his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , he &apos;d have been : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one show a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you &apos;re getting into the museum .
the impressive collection was taken in Montreal , Canada and in Paris .
&quot; it is so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said Director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
it goes with tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into which almost still sur@@ passed kind of man , the fashion history wrote , without ever completing a education .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ er , for it &apos;s great effort : to harvest the d@@ olls , was made for instance a styl@@ ist engaged for instance .
14 tons of material have with@@ ered the makers according to the Cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the Okto@@ ber@@ fest &apos;s start there was still a special something about : a leather Out@@ fit with cork .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are men rather than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , said ahead of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also today &apos;s t@@ ilt of American ted@@ dy is t@@ ilt in the exhibition .
he is for the first , z@@ est @-@ fashi@@ oned sal@@ aries of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he worked in his ted@@ dy B@@ HS and clothing , Gaul@@ tier .
with a doll to play , his parents would not have allowed him .
the thro@@ wing of fashion he had taught even later .
he st@@ ole his fashion journals and saw the designs of other designers as the Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought that .
for his first own fashion show he did not pay the models .
they got none , was away to keep clothes .
spl@@ end@@ or instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ rie top as fashion @-@ niche
it used to be ro@@ oted on the long stit@@ ches of nitrogen and to pl@@ est pl@@ est therefore 100 meters .
the embroi@@ dered substances and tips were produced in large amount for customers who , for example , bl@@ ank@@ ets and curtains .
the team does not work anymore , explains Professor Rein@@ hardt , the director of at the Mo@@ th@@ ieves .
instead the mode is important .
in the starting times of pl@@ au@@ dul@@ ging panel I played a larger role , was then displac@@ ed by the DIY industry - and now it is re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and for regional cost@@ umes .
even at all , the so @-@ called Vintage mode , which concerned hundreds of sty@@ li@@ stic periods , had a increasing client policy .
who does not use any N@@ ic in the textile branch in Germany , is no longer available .
by us , half of all orders come from us .
Mo@@ th@@ ieves Pl@@ auen has been a member of the industry association pupp@@ et top and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they must wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , roughly 80 percent of the turnover is pl@@ ung@@ ed .
private shops and also the wholesale accounts for almost no more .
our products are hardly able to achieve our products on this road .
the mass properties are produced in the Asian region much cheaper than produced almost exclusively on chains .
in addition , the export will be weaker , currently in Russia and the USA .
there is enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association is also trying to score through environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer from the Emb@@ ro@@ i@@ ary of Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; this year we have a seal of quality , which shows that we would be ec@@ ologically friendly and soci@@ ally . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt : &quot; this means the materials used to be used . &quot;
Gar@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schnee@@ berg University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Art - and has been speci@@ alis@@ ing in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
to meet the competition from Asian countries , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this needs time and courage .
there is a voltage range between the refresh@@ sts of the designer and the firms that need to be beneficial especially here , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , an existing design of existing design will therefore only be varied , to maintain a customer strain .
a few years ago , textile artist Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ painted the historical snow@@ ball tip .

now use the sn@@ ail top for their jewelry .
in a complex procedure the samples can be found in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of pl@@ au@@ ght - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they can also be in the USA , to Australia and Finland - primarily to our clients whose ancestors would like to live in pl@@ omas and the surroundings and some mem@@ ent@@ s .
so I see my jewelry as a modern representative of the pl@@ au@@ lin .

about the experiences of N@@ anny associated with the Ban@@ ks family in times of the world &apos;s economic depression in England .

XI forced to open the economy wider for the world
the economy must be wider outw@@ ards and bro@@ ader , in order to promote growth , said President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping has commissioned a group to collabor@@ ate with the government &apos;s steering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should put itself to improve foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve business preparations for business purposes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in an speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Seminar for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote new start @-@ ups and obtain reforms , to promote new im@@ balance and vit@@ ality , we offer new economic growth , said X@@ i said .
the guide group has adopted a number of directives , including a negative public@@ ity to regul@@ ate the border controls , the promotion of national transport ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the security system .
according to the statement a statement of neg@@ ativity was produced , sectors and businesses who cannot come into question for investments .
the system is gradually tested and tested by testing programs .
the initiative is of importance as it guarantees the market a major role in allocation of resources , a legal state field , and open the market open , affir@@ med the statement .
it will also control controls on the powers deleg@@ ated to the companies and make sure companies choose to perform their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic operation and new mechanisms for promoting the regional growth .
as part of a supply , state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government does not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitim@@ ate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and give better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moreover , it is made easier for foreigners , a lasting so@@ aring permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; work permit to facilitate the requirements and the application process will be made easier .
the law of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and professional judges and state prosec@@ ut@@ ors were also discussed at a meeting .
during the meeting also Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders like the Li@@ u Yun@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as published in one statement .
EU aims to double the mercury limit value in smo@@ or fish
the European Commission plans to double the limit values for mercury in big smo@@ or fish and to promote a significantly higher dose of ner@@ ve gifts .
the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who is the corresponding working draft of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects were satisfied with full force of pregnant women and small children , &quot; stated Matthias Wol@@ schmi@@ dt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
Wolf farmers are supposed to achieve the mar@@ g@@ inal values of the ner@@ ve gi@@ f@@ tes for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ ks or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
however , big fish @-@ fish already affects heavy mercury that , on the basis of the current limit values , approximately 50 per cent of length must not be sold .
according to the number of limit values , only 14.5 percent would be rejected .
in return for this attrac@@ t@@ ant , the EU aims to limit the limit values from currently 0,5 mg to 0.1 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch acknowledged this as &quot; tri@@ ck , &quot; because smaller do@@ cks , such as kar@@ ma , usually imp@@ acted as low they will already hold the planned limits today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the failure in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ verse or de@@ fle@@ ction man@@ eu@@ vers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a highly po@@ ison@@ ous heavy metal , which largely in@@ car@@ ic@@ ured upon the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , the federal government is warned that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already pre @-@ only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cause small amounts of damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains its home with regard to the applicable limit values , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health concern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not expect a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health concern &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly obtained by coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information by the Federal Ministry of National Research , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bo@@ ck bom@@ bed more than six tons of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the amount prescribed in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish is almost passed in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and the country @-@ wide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mir@@ ror &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted from the paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide regist@@ ers prior to mercury in fish already had the most frequent health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
