the BI@@ Z could close the stand@@ by loan agreements with the central banks of cre@@ dit@@ ors if banks issue a corresponding application .
the agreement could be closed down to the total amount of the cre@@ dit@@ er@@ land on the mechanism , namely within a total limits of 2,@@ 7@@ 25 billion b@@ illing ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future read@@ iness funds of the affili@@ ates .
however , already below some conditions called , to whose application the BI@@ Z would be ready .
at each stand@@ by credit , the B@@ IS would initially take over a commitment for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als stocks , but that a total of five years will be exceeded .
at the opening of the loans as well as with their et@@ wa@@ iger , the B@@ IS would charge a loan open@@ er vision .
in addition , the first draw would not be made at the exp@@ iry of a month after completion of the stand@@ by agreement , thus the Bank can take the required adjustments of its own liquidity .
the inser@@ tions would be carried out in the currencies available in the B@@ IS for exp@@ ulsion of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would have to negoti@@ ate on time , taking into account of the bank account , expected three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those who used the B@@ IS at their time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market movements .
however , if the BI@@ Z has to defend itself the necessary funds to reach the market , then it could reach a maximum rate that corresponds to a corresponding margin of Li@@ bor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grat@@ eful to you if you would like to share the consent of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
