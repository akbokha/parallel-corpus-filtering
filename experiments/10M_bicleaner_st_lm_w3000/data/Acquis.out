I ad@@ ore to give you the consent of the community to these changes , and strike you as an appointment for the entry into force 1 . January 1978 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grat@@ eful to you if you would confirm your government to confirm your government . &quot; &quot; &quot;

agreement in the form of a letter between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements , on the mobil@@ ization of the Member States within the framework of the medium @-@ term financial contribution
the BI@@ Z could close the stand@@ by loan agreements with the central banks of cre@@ dit@@ ors if banks issue a corresponding application .
the agreement could be closed down to the total amount of the cre@@ dit@@ er@@ land on the mechanism , namely within a total limits of 2,@@ 7@@ 25 billion b@@ illing ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future read@@ iness funds of the affili@@ ates .
however , already below some conditions called , to whose application the BI@@ Z would be ready .
at each stand@@ by credit , the B@@ IS would initially take over a commitment for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als stocks , but that a total of five years will be exceeded .
at the opening of the loans as well as with their et@@ wa@@ iger , the B@@ IS would charge a loan open@@ er vision .
in addition , the first draw would not be made at the exp@@ iry of a month after completion of the stand@@ by agreement , thus the Bank can take the required adjustments of its own liquidity .
the inser@@ tions would be carried out in the currencies available in the B@@ IS for exp@@ ulsion of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would have to negoti@@ ate on time , taking into account of the bank account , expected three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those who used the B@@ IS at their time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market movements .
however , if the BI@@ Z has to defend itself the necessary funds to reach the market , then it could reach a maximum rate that corresponds to a corresponding margin of Li@@ bor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grat@@ eful to you if you would like to share the consent of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the BI@@ Z could close the stand@@ by loan agreements with the central banks of cre@@ dit@@ ors if banks issue a corresponding application .

in Part II of this protocol , samples and devices need to be ster@@ ile , red@@ dish , and non @-@ toxic .
it is recommended to add the ship@@ ments to the infusion in the infusion and the solvents for dry prepar@@ atory systems .
human whole blood is affected by healthy people and mixed with an appropriate anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans .
C ) which are non @-@ free from blood trans@@ fu@@ sions communic@@ able diseases , as far as this can be ensured through simple medical examination and medical history .
the blood withdrawal is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is controlled by a closed , ster@@ ile tube system into a ster@@ ile bottle in which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ sive solution was im@@ pur@@ ged before ster@@ il@@ izing .
after finishing the blood flow , the bottle is immediately closed and cool to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . thereafter , it must be opened immediately prior to the use of the blood .

a concept of human red blood cells is a unit of human blood , from which the largest part of the plasma has been removed .
it contains all red blood cells of the unit , which has been gained from which it has been gained ; other blood cells can be present or can be partially removed .
the fluid content of the concentration consists of either the remaining plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic ir@@ rig@@ ation solution that has been added to the plasma .
the volume of the red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , the approximate percentage of red blood cells is used , thus the approximate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( hem@@ atology ) is to be put on label .
all necessary processes must be made under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the infusion must be carried out under the use of a ster@@ ile , closed system and exclusively through pressure .
is an artificial ir@@ rig@@ ation solution has been added , so it is also to give the label also its volume and composition .
the human dry plasma is extracted by drying of the liquid , which puts themselves at cent@@ ri@@ fug@@ ation or se@@ dim@@ entation of human being .
the human dry plasma is extracted by refriger@@ ation drying or any other method using a den@@ atur@@ isation of proteins .
the dry product can easily be dissolved in water , which corresponds to the liquid level , from which one went out in the production of substance .
the protein concentration of the so @-@ derived solution should not be less than 45 g per litre , and the solution may not contain any visible signs of ha@@ em@@ ol@@ y@@ sis products .

appropriate samples from re@@ agents are to store so long from the laboratory at@@ orio , until with some probability , the Char@@ ge is not used anymore .
the re@@ agents of the re@@ agents can contain substances human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary tools to rein@@ force the effectiveness and preservation of the stability .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups following their effective part .
this means not that the re@@ agents of human origin contain substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents are not able to contain substances of human origin .
on each of the container you can attach a black printed label in English and French , the following information contains : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,

some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates on object dreams also homogen@@ ous red blood cells , which are melted in their own ser@@ um or plasma .
the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group may possibly change when International standard prepar@@ ate are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group ser@@ um ( human )
anti @-@ D ser@@ um is extracted from the blood of one or several persons , which are immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells , which contain the an@@ tigen D but not containing human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D .

in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells , which contain the an@@ tigen D , the ser@@ um should contain the possibility of blood cells , the Do @-@ An@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are intended for use of object dreams in accordance with the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , have to be mixed with an equal amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ percent , within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .

it re@@ acts with floods of human red blood cells , which contain the an@@ tigen C but not containing human red blood cells that contain the C an@@ tigen .
this ser@@ a is therefore only specific to the C @-@ an@@ tigen only if the tested blood cells are melted in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution .

sera the speci@@ fic@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ c and the speci@@ fic@@ ity anti @-@ D + can be extracted directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E ser@@ um .
in a given ser@@ um , both anti@@ bodies have to be effective at the same time by the manufacturer specified response conditions .
if a ser@@ um is intended for use on object lab@@ s according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , then the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ time is supposed to show a reaction at all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , not less than with the anti@@ qu@@ anti@@ bodies .
