Ab@@ ili@@ fy is used to treat ag@@ grav@@ ated episodes and prevention of man@@ ic episodes of patients who have applied to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used to remove or used the melting tablets in patients where the hat@@ ching of tablets is prepared .
in patients who simultaneously accept other medicines , which are to be dismant@@ led equally as Ab@@ ili@@ fy should be adapted to the dose of Ab@@ ili@@ fy .
the signal transmission between brain cells due to &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter &quot; , i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of ner@@ ve cells to each other .
Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ hydr@@ ate is probably especially as &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ amine ( also called Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but with lower dimensions as the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
since D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ amine play a role in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder which helps to norm@@ alize the activity of brain , which means psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and their re@@ occur .
the efficacy of Ab@@ ili@@ fy , to prevent the symptoms of symptoms , was investigated in three studies by up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or similar diseases , compared to a placebo over a period of two hours .
in another study , Ab@@ ili@@ fy was compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study the efficacy of Ab@@ ili@@ ze and placebo which had been re@@ active to 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ized with g@@ ili@@ fy .
the efficacy of Ab@@ ili@@ fy inj@@ ector solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder which suffered on increased un@@ rest , with the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the changes in symptoms of patients were examined using a standard sc@@ ala disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment .
the company also led trials to investigate how the body uses the melting tablets and the solution to remove ( up ) .
in the two studies with the injection solution showed patients who received Ab@@ ili@@ ze in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of un@@ rest than those who received a placebo .
in the application of treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Ab@@ ili@@ fy fell into four of the five short @-@ term studies of chronic symptoms more effective than placebo .
Ab@@ ili@@ fy also prevented for up to 74 weeks of more effective than placebo in previously treated patients and when an existing treatment was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
put @-@ out inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms driven un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common adverse events of Ab@@ ili@@ fy ( ob@@ serving at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ am@@ idal distur@@ ban@@ ces ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , se@@ cular@@ isation ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , se@@ clu@@ sion ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , sp@@ inal hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( increased memory output ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , rest@@ less@@ ness , in@@ som@@ nie ( sleep distur@@ b ) and anxi@@ ety .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ab@@ ili@@ fy in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and from medium to severe serious episodes of patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes on the treatment of Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole , compared to the risks .
in addition , the Committee became the result that the advantages of injection solution in the rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , if an oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for placing on the placing of Ab@@ ili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of constant to severe episodes of the B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar @-@ I@@ - disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients , mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment of Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ zol languages ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
an increased effectiveness of doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected , although individual patients can benefit from higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y amounts to 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar @-@ I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proved .
with respect to the larger sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose may be considered , if clinical factors are just@@ ify ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induction brake is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ ip@@ yl@@ benzene dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ic@@ idal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after change of anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased Su@@ icide risk with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica .
Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease , path@@ ogenic disease , conditions that are used for hyp@@ ot@@ ony disease ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hyp@@ ov@@ ol@@ emia , treatment with bl@@ am@@ inated medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ati@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that were a year or less digest@@ ed , there were occ@@ asi@@ onal reports about during treatment with Ari@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole .
if used in an AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y patients treated patients and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , should be taken into consideration to reduce the dose or treatment .
if a patient developed signs and symptoms developed on a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear fever without any additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica must be removed including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
therefore , Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole should be used in patients with cr@@ amp@@ fan@@ fare in the An@@ am@@ nese or in terms of states that are applied to cau@@ tion with cau@@ tion .
56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole in patients with psych@@ osis were associated with psych@@ osis who were treated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , an increased death of death in comparison to the placebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosing and the response to un@@ wanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events in treated with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ benzene treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ ac@@ ti or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em Kom@@ a or death , was reported in patients with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic ingredients , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no exact risk ass@@ ess@@ ments for hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia @-@ related events at AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic ingredients that allow direct failure .

a weight gain is generally known for nar@@ rated patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ie due to Com@@ or@@ bid@@ ding , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ika , where weight gain is observed , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and could lead to serious comp@@ lications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole on the central nervous system is careful when Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines is taken with over@@ l@@ able side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ Ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ zol , although this effect is not relevant to clin@@ ically .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a high @-@ effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects have , and therefore , similar dose can be made .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism can result in the common use with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ zol compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 extensive met@@ ab@@ olic .
if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y into consideration , the potential benefits should survive for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore should be similar dose reductions .
according to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage should be increased from AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y to the dose height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
di@@ lu@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered jointly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be reck@@ oned with a constant increase in the arith@@ met@@ ic concentration .
in clinical trials showed doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ ane ra@@ ole a day no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zol ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
people should be given to receiving their doctor if they are pregnant or use a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole .
due to the in@@ sufficient data situation for the security in humans and in the re@@ productive studies in the animal , this medicine may not be applied in the pregnancy , unless possible use just@@ i@@ fies the potential risk for the mo@@ wers .
however , like other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica , the patients should be warned of dangerous machines , including power vehicles , including power vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole has no negative effect .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the adverse events listed below is defined in accordance with the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
sch@@ izophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole , a total amount of incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ idity and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared with patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ ane ra@@ ole treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients were placebo under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients who were treated with Ari@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes on B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar @-@ I disorder - in a controlled study over 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ ip@@ raz@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l treatment .
in another study above 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ ip@@ yl@@ benzene treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
during the long period lasting over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ ip@@ raz@@ or treatment and 15,@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo treated .
a comparison between the patient groups below Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ zol and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , there was no medi@@ cally important differences .
increases the CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ ine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ ip@@ yl@@ benzene treated patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
to adverse events that can occur in connection with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ osis , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and Kr@@ amp@@ fan@@ cases , among undes@@ irable illness , and increased mortality in older dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical studies and since the market launch , un@@ intended or deliber@@ ate over@@ l@@ act@@ ings were observed with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death .
although there are no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dosage with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole ; it is un@@ likely that hem@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dosage of benefits , as Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole has a high plasma integration .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole in vitro showed a high aff@@ inity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor , as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , to Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7- to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ore and for hist@@ amine @-@ H1@@ receptor .
in the gift of Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers showed a dos@@ si@@ ent reduction in the bin@@ ge of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor @-@ Lig@@ anden , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on tur@@ key .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 228 patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole showed a statistically significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l @-@ controlled study was 52 out of the proportion of response of the patients who had a response to study medicine in both groups ( Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values are defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sion rates , showed a significantly stronger than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ized patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole group and 57 % under placebo .
in an Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study was involved in sch@@ izophren@@ ia of over 26 weeks , 314 patients were significantly reduced compared with an average weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ist studies with more flexible dosing for 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole showed an improvement over placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ist study of 3 weeks with fixed dosing of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ zol showed no superior efficacy .
in two Plac@@ ement@@ o- and active @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ist studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole showed an opposite placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a gain effect that was comparable to lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l in week 12 .
in addition to Ari@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole , 12 a comparable proportion of patients with sy@@ mptom@@ atic remission of the man@@ ie at like lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , the accompanying treatment with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole showed a superior efficacy in the reduction of man@@ ic symptoms compared to the mono@@ therap@@ ies with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 26 weeks , followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks , with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation phase , Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ zol showed a remission in contrast to placebo in relation to the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , predominantly in the prevention of a return in the man@@ ie .

in Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as in pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ ical investigation , patients showed no sexually @-@ dependent effects .
a pop @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics did not notice a reference to clin@@ ically significant differences concerning ethnic origin or the impact of the room on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ ical properties of Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ ation o @-@ Ari@@ ane ra@@ ole were similar in patients with he@@ avier ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study on subjects with various grave liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pug@@ al A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ ation , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis in class C , which is not enough to move to the metab@@ olic capacity .

in an Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study was involved in sch@@ izophren@@ ia of over 26 weeks , 314 patients were significantly reduced compared with an average weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg ) .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ist study of 3 weeks with fixed dosing of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ zol showed no superior efficacy .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of 30 mg of Ari@@ ane ra@@ ole was compared to healthy volunteers , the ratio between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max mean value and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .

in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed for dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ fold of the medium Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is applied to rapid control of ag@@ ility and behaviour in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar @-@ I disorder , when an oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is appropriate to termin@@ ate the treatment with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole injection solution , and the oral application of Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole should be started .
to minim@@ ize the res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , a injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle using ob@@ sol@@ ving regions is recommended .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) depends on the individual clinical status under consideration of the medication or acute or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if an additional oral treatment with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole is inde@@ xed , see the summary of the features of the drug with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y melting tablets or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution .
there are no investigations regarding the efficacy of Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole injection solution in patients with ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders resulting from sch@@ izophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar @-@ I disorder .
in addition , if necessary therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ ane ra@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed in terms of extreme conditions or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) .
investigations regarding safety and efficacy of arith@@ met@@ ic injection solution are not used for patients with alcohol or pharmaceutical tox@@ ication ( established or illegal medicine ) .
Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease , path@@ ogenic disease , conditions that are used for hyp@@ ot@@ ony disease ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hyp@@ ov@@ ol@@ emia , treatment with bl@@ am@@ inated medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .

the following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole injection solution to ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of the adverse events listed below is defined in accordance with the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common to ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified in clinical trials with oral care of Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ ip@@ raz@@ or treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients were placebo under placebo .
in another study above 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ ip@@ raz@@ or treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
during the long @-@ term period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ ane ra@@ ole treatment and 15,@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo treated .
a comparison between the patient groups below Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ zol and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , there was no medi@@ cally important differences .
increases the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ ip@@ yl@@ benzene treated patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .

110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the arith@@ met@@ ic injection solution associated with statistically significant improvements of ag@@ iti@@ vity / behaviour compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as Ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ b@@ ance associated with a statistically significant increase in symptoms regarding ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed average improvement of the output value on the P@@ AN@@ SS exc@@ it@@ ement Component scores in the primary 2 hours final point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole .
in analyses of patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ iti@@ vity , a similar efficacy relative to the overall population was observed , but a statistical significance was detected due to a reduced patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 228 patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statistically significant increase in psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a semi @-@ controlled study conducted in week 52 the proportion of response of the patients who had a response to the study medicine , in both groups ( Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values from measuring sc@@ ents , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Virus scale , showed a significantly stronger than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ized patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ ip@@ raz@@ or ( oral ) group and 57 % under placebo .
in an Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study was involved in sch@@ izophren@@ ia above 26 weeks , the 314 patients were significantly reduced compared with an average reduction of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg ) .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , the accompanying treatment with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole showed a superior efficacy in the reduction of man@@ ic symptoms compared to the mono@@ therap@@ ies with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week studio expansion in man@@ ic patients , with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation phase , Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ zol showed a remission in contrast to placebo for preventing a bi@@ polar response , predominantly in the prevention of a return in the man@@ ie .
the Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole AU@@ C is within the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection 90 % larger the AU@@ C according to the same dose as tablet . the system@@ ic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level at 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole injection solution was toler@@ ated by rats and monkey @-@ toler@@ ated and resulted in no direct tox@@ icity of a target organ after repeated treatment with system@@ ic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies for re@@ productive tox@@ icity according to intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ related concerns after matern@@ al exposure showed in 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole ( oral ) to safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at recur@@ ring gift , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , tox@@ icity and the ag@@ it@@ ogenic potential , the pre@@ m@@ ative data let not recognize any special haz@@ ards for human beings .
tox@@ ic@@ ological effects were observed only with doses or ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they only have limited or no significance for clinical use .

the effectiveness of I@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study , participated in 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters were previously an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mono@@ therap@@ ies ) was compared to the treatment of a conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines for the reduction of side effects ) .
overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 ( 31 % ) of 229 patients receiving Avastin to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el herbal medic@@ inal products .
if only the patients who were treated for the first time were treated with metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between pharmac@@ euticals and survival compared to the deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
in contrast , in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in relation to these indicators that we included x@@ ane effective as conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ de pharmac@@ euticals .
it also may not be used in patients who have kept silent or before starting the treatment of low neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ en@@ ities in the blood .
the Committee on Human@@ itarian agent ( CH@@ MP ) noted that the first treatment is no longer observed , more effective as conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicine was , and that in contrast to other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained products must not be given to other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission approved the company in Bios@@ c@@ ience Limited for placing the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mono@@ therap@@ ist is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer car@@ cin@@ oma , with which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic breast cancer is not indicated and is not indicated for the standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ contained therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with he@@ avier neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ en@@ count &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory Neurop@@ ath@@ y during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
when sens@@ ory Neurop@@ ath@@ y 3 is the treatment to break down to a degree of degree 1 or 2 , and with all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations in patients with mild to severe impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there are no studies with patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there are currently no adequate data to the recommendation of Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use with children under 18 years due to un@@ sufficient data for the in@@ correct and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ linked nan@@ op@@ ar@@ tic form@@ ulations of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have considerably other pharmac@@ ological features as other formulation of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a sy@@ mptom@@ atic treatment should be treated immediately , and the patient must not be treated with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients there should be no ren@@ ew the x@@ ane treatment cycles , until the neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ic number has increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function ( Bil@@ ir@@ ub@@ in &gt; 5 x U@@ LN or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x U@@ LN ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clear with Abra@@ x@@ ane was not detected in connection with cardi@@ ac tox@@ icity , cardiovascular inci@@ dents are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or based cardi@@ ac disease or lung disease .
in case of patients after the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , these can be treated with the usual Anti@@ em@@ et@@ ika and stip@@ ends .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant women or women in the child@@ bearing age who has no effective conception , except for the treatment of the mother with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is in@@ compatible .
women in the working age should apply during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable processing method .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be stim@@ ulated , during and up to six months after the treatment no child can bear witness .
male patients should be advised before treatment over a sperm cells , since the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertil@@ ity .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause adverse events such as ti@@ red@@ ness ( very often ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can work on the traffic and ability to serve machines .
the following are the most common and most important events of adverse events , which occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were included in the piv@@ ot@@ al Phase III clinical trial once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 .
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most remarkable significant hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( at 79 % of patients ) and was rapidly reversible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; leu@@ k@@ open@@ ie was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed with 46 % of patients treated with os@@ x@@ ane patients and was bad@@ min@@ ced in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 , the side effects are listed in combination with the gift of Cho@@ x@@ ane as a mono@@ therap@@ ist at any dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .

the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ blind studies and of 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a Phase III comparative study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer was treated with metastatic breast cancer , which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mono@@ therap@@ ies with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , either in the form of solvent containing allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of 40@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 minute infusion without pre@@ condition ( N = 229 ) .
when taking the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had a vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ asis .
14 % of patients had not yet received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ ases and 19 % because of metast@@ ases and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and progression @-@ free survival for patients who received &gt; First @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity compared to P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving a degree of patients who lived at a time of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y degrees 3 .
the natural process of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y for withdraw@@ l on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of I@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of the total @-@ P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el in total to 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute infusion of os@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the efficiency of activity ( AU@@ C ) increased from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analog to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After an intraven@@ ous gift of I@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration increased to multi @-@ phase plasma .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume amounts to a far @-@ reaching external distribution and / or turn@@ out of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ ical properties of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute injection of 260 mg / m2 , compared with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 , solvent free P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was somewhat higher than the Abra@@ x@@ ane gift higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent @-@ cont@@ amin@@ ant P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was diagnosed with os@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , that P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily metab@@ oli@@ zed in first line to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary tract was reduced by 4 % of the total total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far not @-@ ren@@ al cle@@ us .
however , over patients aged over 75 years of age are only few data available because only 3 patients who participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ etic analysis .

this means that wast@@ es is similar to a biological medicine that has already been approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference ort &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood pressure values used in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion comp@@ lications , if the intervention is not possible before the procedure , an blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with wast@@ es must be led under the supervision of a physician , the experience gained in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine is shown .
in patients with ren@@ al problems and patients who want to leave a self @-@ blood don@@ ating , dec@@ lining is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
injection can also be made from the patient or his professional , if they have an appropriate guidance .
patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency or patients receiving chemotherapy should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl of children ) .
the iron values of all patients are in front of the treatment to ensure that no iron defic@@ iency should be given , and iron ore should be given during the entire treatment .
in patients who received chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ emia can be caused by a ery@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel or that the body does not suff@@ ici@@ ently talks about the body &apos;s own ery@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in .

Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with an injection into a main study involving 479 patients suffering from ren@@ al problems caused by ren@@ al problems .
all patients participating in this study was inj@@ ected at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ein , before they were either def@@ amed either to ab@@ stain@@ ed or continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the key indicator for efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bet@@ s between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also laid out the results of a study , in which the effects of under the skin are examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o with 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients who were caused by ren@@ al problems caused an@@ emia patients suffering from kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ glo@@ ic values of patients were treated at the same size as with those who continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to these patients showed E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / d@@ L .
the most common adverse events of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase of blood pressure , occasionally to symptoms of a bovine spongiform encephalopath@@ y ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ ori@@ ous head@@ ache and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be used in patients who may be sensitive to epoxy res@@ in al@@ fa or one of the other parts .
re@@ amed as inj@@ ections under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , since more studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile was shown in accordance with the regulations of the European Union ( CH@@ MP ) .

HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ tic program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / d@@ L ( 6,2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pe@@ diat@@ ric patients where the hem@@ or@@ glo@@ bin@@ ation between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should lie .
depending on the age , gender and overall disease may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease @-@ load ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease is required by the physician .
a rise in the hem@@ glo@@ bin@@ s around more than 2 g / d@@ L ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should be avoided during four weeks .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients can occasionally be observed in a patient individual hem@@ glo@@ bin@@ values about or under the hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin@@ - target concentration .
given this hem@@ glo@@ om vari@@ ability on a corresponding dose management , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / d@@ L ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should be reached .
if the hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin@@ ic exceeds more than 2 g / d@@ L ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ glo@@ bin@@ ic value exceeds 12 g / d@@ L ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ep@@ och@@ in al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be monitored in order to ensure that ep@@ och@@ in al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of an@@ emia and An@@ chor@@ oid symptoms .
these clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where the initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / d@@ dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where the initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / d@@ L or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

patients may vary depending on age , gender and total disease @-@ load depending on age , gender and overall disease @-@ load ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease cases are required .
given this hem@@ glo@@ om vari@@ ability on a corresponding dose management , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / d@@ L ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should be reached .
patients should be monitored close to ensure that ep@@ och@@ in al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of An@@ chor@@ oid symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of treatment the hem@@ o@@ glo@@ om value of at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the ret@@ ik@@ oid rate increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl to the output value , the dose of 150 i.e. / kg three times per week or 450 kg / kg must be retained per week .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used for the treatment of the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes bone br@@ ittle ) both in women and in men as well as for men .
it is used in patients with a high fra@@ c@@ tive risk ( broken bones ) , including those who have recently suffered a non @-@ traum@@ atic hip break@@ down like the bone . • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get caught a disease , which changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should be taken at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days . patients with hip t@@ inc@@ ture should receive a major dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or by injection into one muscle .
the administration of Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( mean against inflamm@@ ation ) shortly after application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , gri@@ pp@@ e@@ similar symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
to treat the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingre@@ dient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used for evaluation of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it was examined the number of sp@@ ine and hip fra@@ c@@ tures over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis for over 50 years , who had suffered a hil@@ ly t@@ inc@@ ture , the number of fra@@ c@@ tures over a period of up to five years was examined .
in two studies , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies at a total of 357 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosphate ) .
the main indicator for the efficacy was whether the amount of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the ser@@ um ( an enzyme , ab@@ h@@ ed the bone structure ) decreased in blood , or at least 75 % compared to the output value .
in the study with older women , the risk of ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without oste@@ opor@@ osis was reduced ) over a period of three years compared to placebo by 70 % .
in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis anter@@ ior chamber ) , the risk of hil@@ ly fra@@ c@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip fra@@ cture had 9 % of the patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a a Fra@@ ktur ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under Placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after the infusion and are often less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may not be used in patients who may be sensitive to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or other parts of other parts .
as for all Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates patients are subject to patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a the risk of kidney pain , reactions to the infusion of the infusion and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ y ( ab@@ st@@ ains of bone tissue ) in a pine .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a presents recon@@ n@@ aissance material for doctors who contains A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , the evidence suggests how the medicine is explained , as well as a similar material for patients , where the side effects of the drug is explained and noted when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission approved the company Nov@@ art@@ is Europ@@ harm Limited for placing on the distribution of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a throughout the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • women with an increased risk of fra@@ c@@ tures , including patients with a recently exp@@ elled low @-@ traum@@ atic hip t@@ inc@@ ture .
to treat the post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous infusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip t@@ inc@@ ture , the administration of the infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended for two or more weeks after the operative supply of the hip t@@ inc@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ get Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long @-@ emission period was observed in patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure an adequate supply of calcium , at least 500 m@@ g. of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip t@@ inc@@ ture , an initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a infusion .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this group of patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination with older patients are similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , as data is responsible for in@@ solvency and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for patients with he@@ avier ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because of this patient population only limited clinical experience .
pre @-@ existing mort@@ ar emia is treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a prior to the beginning of therapy to treat calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the quick release of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid , the bone structure can develop a temporary , involving sy@@ mptom@@ atic mort@@ gage , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure an adequate supply of calcium , at least 500 m@@ g. of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , bad oral hygiene ) should be used before application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental examination with adequate preventive teeth .
for patients who need dental interference , there are no data available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates reduced the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the p@@ ines area .
clinical evaluation by the treatment physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced through the gift of Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of serious adverse events reported in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a were increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 852 ) .
oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ gy Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; RF@@ T &#93; ) was comparable to the total distance between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occ@@ asi@@ onal ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) undes@@ irable pharmaceutical effects are listed in Table 1 .
ren@@ al impair@@ ment of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with ren@@ al functional disorders ( i.e. , an increase in the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure , associated with kidney failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ ine Clear@@ ance ( measured before the administration ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney failure and a limited kidney function was comparable to oste@@ opor@@ osis in a clinical study on three years comparable between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ ra and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory , the temporary as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic coefficients showed that in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study treated patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get @-@ studies .
all patients received sufficient quantities of vitamin D and calcium in the study to post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical trials according to a hi@@ ft@@ . t@@ inc@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical trials , the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ in@@ ely verified , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study has been reported on local reactions to the infusion , such as Roman , sw@@ elling and / or pain ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the or@@ acle area , especially during cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( prim@@ itive in the oral field ) reported with bis@@ phosph@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs for local infections including oste@@ opath@@ itis , and the majority of reports rel@@ ates to cancer patients after Zah@@ nex@@ p@@ tions or other dental surgery .
7 Study with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients underwent oste@@ o@@ ek@@ y in the or@@ jaw field at one with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and with placebo treated patients .
in case of over@@ dosage , which leads to a clinical @-@ related mort@@ ar al , can be achieved by the gift of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous infusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ at .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was detected at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) , with either a bone structure and a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the sh@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing ed@@ dy body t@@ inc@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric age structures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a significantly decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or several new ed@@ dy body structures ( see Table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated patients of 75 years and over had a reduced risk of 60 % compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
effects on hip fra@@ c@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a showed a constant effect on three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hat@@ ch@@ ings .
effect on the bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density at the lum@@ bar hydro@@ chlor@@ ic acid , th@@ igh and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Increase of the lum@@ bar sp@@ ine in the lum@@ bar sp@@ ine by 6.7 % , the total stro@@ kes by 6.0 % , the shaft as around 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology In 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the Beck@@ enk@@ amm .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed in comparison with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to placebo an increase in bone volume and ob@@ taining the vas@@ cular bone architecture .
bone sales mark@@ er The bones @-@ specific phosph@@ at@@ tics of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in the ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in the ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in perio@@ dically intervals during the study period .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial output until 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the starting value of 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial output until 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ in@@ ely used but the majority of the patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5.000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks before the infusion .
the overall mort@@ em was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HOR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ RF@@ T study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment in comparison to the placebo treatment the BM@@ D at the overall level and scra@@ pers in all points .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment took over 24 months compared to placebo treatment with an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total and 4.3 % at the buck@@ le .
clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ RF@@ T study , 508 men were random@@ ized and the BM@@ D assessed the BM@@ D after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical trials in men ; the frequency of clinical trials was 7.5 % at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % when compared to placebo .
in another study involving men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) , once an annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was related to the percentage change in Al@@ end@@ ron in comparison to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment in mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone of the bone of the bone was investigated in patients and patients ( medium ser@@ um @-@ mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ fold up to 3,@@ 0@@ fold of age @-@ specific upper normal value at the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to taking 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once a day during 2 months was demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
after 6 months of combined results , a similar decrease of pain intensity and pain influ@@ encing was observed in comparison to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified by the end of the six @-@ month main study as Respon@@ sible ( on therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate @-@ treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , compared to 71 of the treated patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients , maintaining a medium duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
one @-@ one and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions from 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data that proved dos@@ is@@ regardless .
after that , the plasma concentration increased from &lt; 10 % to the maximum value of 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
quick @-@ phase disappearance of the large cycle times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ to 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long Eli@@ min@@ ation phase with a terminal Eli@@ min@@ ational cancer time t ½ γ 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β with the above 1 ½ -@@ values ) represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption in bone and the de@@ position over the kidneys .
in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose can be found in urine , while the rest mainly is bound to bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the infusion , but had no effect on the area under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a reduced Clear@@ ance of by Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzymes is un@@ likely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not yet metab@@ oli@@ zed by humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , vari@@ ably dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ ine Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ ine Clear@@ ance , and was found in the 64 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
it arises that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a non @-@ kidney cleanse until a cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ aring up to 35 ml / min does not require dosing adap@@ table to Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
there are only restricted data to this population for heavy kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) .
acute tox@@ icity The maximum non @-@ acting intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and a weight of 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
for studies in dogs , individual doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C ) were able to carry 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therap@@ ist exposition , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influ@@ encing .
sub@@ chronic and chronic tox@@ icity in studies with intraven@@ ous application was administered at intervals of 2- 3 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose which is administered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ) , administered at intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to the age of human @-@ therap@@ ist , related to AU@@ C , corresponds to AU@@ C ) .

the most frequent re@@ funds with repeated application was a multiple primary sponsor@@ ship in the Met@@ ap@@ hy@@ se of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a fund that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance .
in rats we observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity of doses of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ normal@@ ities and such a sk@@ el@@ eton .
no ter@@ at@@ oid effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the matern@@ al tox@@ icity was seen at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the lowest ser@@ um calcium @-@ mirror .

summary of the EP@@ AR to the public The present document is a summary of the European public conference report ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to get recommendations concerning the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin dependent diabetes ) , where met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ abet@@ ic medicine ) is not shown . • It can be used together with another di@@ abet@@ ic medicine ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially superior patients ) it can not be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest possible dose .
in combination with a sulph@@ ite compound or ins@@ ulin , the old dose of Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff@@ s or ins@@ ulin can be retained , except for patients with hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced by the dose of the sulph@@ ite ri@@ cane and ins@@ ulin .
this means that the body @-@ owned ins@@ ulin can be used better and the blood sugar level , which means that type 2 diabetes is better adjusted .
with more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fa har@@ n@@ ant , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in blood ( gly@@ cer@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
ac@@ tos led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value which allows the blood sugar levels in use of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional treatment of ac@@ tos to the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sulph@@ ite sulph@@ ide in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin had been studied in 289 patients , patients who participated in addition to ins@@ ulin , a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who participated in the placebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , infections of the upper re@@ spir@@ atory symptoms ( path@@ ways ) , weight gain and hypo@@ an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients either in patients who may react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other parts , still in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency or di@@ abet@@ ic K@@ eto@@ ac@@ acid ( high level view - ac@@ idity level - ac@@ idity level ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos in the frame of a mono@@ therap@@ ist ( when used when used ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for placing on the placing of ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to wh@@ it@@ ish , round , curved and wear on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , which is in@@ sufficient in which met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) .
for use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age are not available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. past heart attack or sy@@ mptom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should begin with the lowest recommended dose , and increase the dose continuously .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain or oils , especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain and o@@ de@@ me when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced illness was carried out .
this study showed an increase in reports about her@@ in@@ suff@@ iciency , but did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver cells ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard section ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range are the liver enzyme values as soon as possible .
if a patient has developed symptoms that refer to an ast@@ ical dysfunction , such as explosive nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , upper con@@ om@@ nia , fatigue , appet@@ ite and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the liver enzymes .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be continued until the procedure was conducted by clinical evaluation .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , dos@@ is@@ dependent weight gain was demonstrated that can be taken by fat deposits and in some cases with a liquid force .
as a result of a Hä@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one therapy after therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a minor reduction in the middle hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ ance ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ atology ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ yster bin@@ s by 3 @-@ 4 % ) and to a lower degree in patients under Sul@@ fon@@ te@@ at and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ ni@@ bin@@ s by 1 @-@ 2 % ) and hem@@ atology ( reduced by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of the elevated ins@@ ins@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity in patients , the Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has been used as or@@ ale dual @-@ pac@@ ed or triple @-@ combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of a dos@@ sier , hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia .
following the market launch of Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , was reported on an occurr@@ ence or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ abet@@ ic mac@@ ular e@@ dems with a reduction of visual acuity .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the consumption of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular o@@ ily , but ad@@ mitt@@ ent doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular defect when patients report on visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ologic examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of messages un@@ wanted events in randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients who were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
the calculated t@@ inc@@ ture was 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the pro@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated patients , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient need a pregnancy or this one , the treatment is to apply ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on investigation of the inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not have relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with drugs , metab@@ oli@@ zed by these enzymes metab@@ oli@@ tiv@@ a , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ can@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ ductor products are not expected .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zil ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in order to increase the 3 times .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is attributable to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treatment of hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ inum neur@@ an@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin @-@ resistant of the parent , thereby reducing the availability of metab@@ olic sub@@ str@@ ates to the f@@ og@@ ale growth .
very frequent &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 10000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( not available from this data ) .
this lead to a temporary change of the tower and the refra@@ c@@ tive index of the lens , as they are also observed in other hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ric@@ ating agents .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents to the three times the upper limit of the standard range is equal to as under Placebo , but more rarely than in comparative groups under met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ te@@ a. .
in a out@@ come study of patients with pre @-@ existing advanced micro@@ vas@@ cular disease , the frequency of a serious heart failure was 1.6 % higher than in placebo when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one bz@@ an .
since the market launch , rarely exceeds her@@ b@@ in@@ suff@@ iciency using Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , more frequently , when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with heart failure in the An@@ am@@ nese .
it was a summar@@ izing analysis of un@@ wanted events in randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with comparative medication treated groups .
in the trial period of 3.5 years the pro@@ active study , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated patients , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , 180 mg / day amounted to 180 mg / day over seven days .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to have a activation of specific core recipe ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome ) prolifer@@ ator of Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to an elevated ins@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity of liver , fat and sk@@ el@@ eton muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose levels in case of ins@@ ulin @-@ resistant .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as a mono@@ therap@@ ist has been continued over two years to investigate the period until post@@ ing the therapeutic efficacy ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 therapy courses ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy , blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was defined by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one at 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was discontinued despite three @-@ month optimization phase , to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo were random@@ ized .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who continue to receive only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction of ins@@ ulin @-@ in @-@ treated group was observed with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one group .
in clinical studies over one year , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a statistically significant decline of the Alb@@ um@@ ine / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ations demonstrated in comparison to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mono@@ therap@@ ists with 45 mg versus placebo ) was examined in a small , for 18 weeks study of type 2 di@@ abet@@ ics .
most clinical studies were observed compared to placebo a reduction in the plasma tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - chol@@ ester@@ ol levels and mar@@ gin@@ ally , but clin@@ ically un@@ significantly increased LD@@ L@@ - chol@@ ester@@ ol levels .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was reduced compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or lic@@ lic@@ os@@ zi@@ d the total pl@@ as@@ mat@@ ri@@ cular gly@@ cem@@ ia and the free fatty acids and elevated the HD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ in@@ spiegel .
in comparison to placebo was found no statistically significant increase in LD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ in@@ spiegel , while met@@ form@@ in and lic@@ en@@ zi@@ d di@@ min@@ ished values were observed .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial which increased tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de mirror , both for a effect on the tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de absorption and also on the he@@ ap of the tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced disease were randomised to either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo for a period of up to 3.5 years .
according to oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly res@@ or@@ ated , with the con@@ cre@@ ations of un@@ changeable pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application .
based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to efficacy in roughly the three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one could not have relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zil ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
according to oral application of radio@@ active Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the mark@@ er was mainly found in the F@@ ishing ( 55 % ) and a lower degree in Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period of un@@ changeable Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total of the active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours .
plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower than in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy subjects , but resem@@ bling the rates of oral Clear@@ ance of the matern@@ ity .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys , after repeated administration of plasma volumes , an@@ a@@ emia and diversi@@ fied ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ t@@ roph@@ ie .
this is attributable to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treatment of hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ inum neur@@ an@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin @-@ resistant of the parent , thereby reducing the availability of metab@@ olic sub@@ str@@ ates to the f@@ og@@ ale growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , hyper@@ pl@@ asia of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( male rats ) of the ur@@ inary epi@@ thel@@ ium was induced .
in a animal model of family @-@ famil@@ ial poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ones resulted in an increased frequency of col@@ ont@@ um .
the tablets are white to wh@@ it@@ ish , round , flat and wear on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
the calculated t@@ inc@@ ture was 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the pro@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated patients , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
in another study about two years the effects of a combination of met@@ form@@ in were examined with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d .
in clinical studies over 1 year , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , statistically significant decline of the Alb@@ um@@ ine / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ations demonstrated in comparison to the output values .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial which increased tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de mirror , both across a effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic absorption as well as on the he@@ aders of Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study was missing the target of its primary end@@ point , a combination of the overall mort@@ al infections , stroke Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ usi@@ ar@@ isation and Rev@@ as@@ cular@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , found the results close that with the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one no cardiovascular risk are associated with the intake of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was produced in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pan@@ cre@@ as can produce no ins@@ ulin , and type 2 diabetes , where the body is not able to use the ins@@ ulin in effective .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cer@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane resulted in a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror which indicates that the blood sugar levels were similar , similar to other human ins@@ ulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may not react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to human@@ ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other parts .
Moreover , the cans of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted , if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can be eff@@ ected on blood sugar ( the complete list is to be paid for the complete list ) .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was survived in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for placing the placing on the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed ins@@ ulin products normally applied once or twice daily , if a fast initi@@ als effect together with a longer lasting effect will be desired .
the injection needle has to be loaded for at least 6 seconds under the skin to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar is considerably improved by an intense ins@@ ulin therapy , the hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ cem@@ ia warning sympt@@ om can be perceived and should be advised accordingly .
any modification with regards strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , ins@@ ulin type ( fast effective , flexible , long @-@ acting ins@@ ulin , etc . ) , type of ins@@ ulin ( ins@@ ulin ins@@ ulin , human ins@@ ulin , ins@@ ulin ins@@ ulin , and / or production method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against ins@@ ulin origin ) may lead that a variation of the dosage is necessary .
if the change to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane on the patient is required , this may be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the changeover .
some patients where hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ cem@@ ic reactions were reported after a change from animal ins@@ ulin in human ins@@ ulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronoun@@ ced or differently compared with their previous ins@@ ulin .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already have signs of cryst@@ alline diseases , including arthritis ( pain and inflamm@@ ation in the joints ) or Gi@@ fts ( &quot; stones &quot; ) . larger documents can lead to joint and bone damage .
if the ur@@ inary acid intake levels after two to four weeks are still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , you can still occur Gi@@ cht@@ an@@ cies ; therefore , the patient is recommended to treat patients at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic still further medicines for prevention of tox@@ icity .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ tran@@ spl@@ ant because it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study enrolled at the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three vari@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( medic@@ inal medic@@ inal medication ) and of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( other medicines for treating hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of 300 mg once daily ; patients with kidney problems were only 100 mg per day .
the main inde@@ c@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary acid level in blood was 6 mg / d@@ L in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who had Aden@@ ov@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg of income , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once spent a total of 120 mg once a day in the blood of less than 6 mg / d@@ L .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under the case of placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nautical sea ) , r@@ ash and normal liver values .
in particular in patients with heart attacks in the atri@@ cal history , an increased risk of certain side effects , which affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective at the lowering of the ur@@ inary acid level in the blood more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .

clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ act study as described below ) , which were performed with 1.8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
in each study the primary efficacy point was in every study of the proportion of patients where the last three bi@@ um levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / d@@ L ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ ine value of &gt; 1.5 mg / d@@ L and ≤ 2.0 mg / d@@ L .
the AP@@ EX study showed in terms of lowering the ser@@ um @-@ acid level below 6 mg / d@@ L ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) ( see Table 2 and Figure 1 ) , as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily , compared with conventional used doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act study showed a statistically significant reduction of the ser@@ um @-@ acid level below 6 mg / d@@ L ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily , compared to the used dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of the ser@@ um @-@ acid level of &lt; 6.0 mg / d@@ dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the physician attendance at week 2 and permanently kept permanent over the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um incre@@ in@@ ance values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al impair@@ ment The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with ren@@ al impair@@ ment ( d. h .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficacy point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there was no clin@@ ically significant differences in regard to the percentage of ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl About 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ act study ) had a ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ L .
in two years , data collected from the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent lowering of the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid level showed that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 were required to treat a tox@@ icity ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients required any treatment against a tox@@ ic@@ rack ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the tox@@ icity size , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete disappearance of pa@@ ge@@ pa@@ ws up to the month 24 .
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ P / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term renewal studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers the maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area below the plasma concentration time ( AU@@ C ) of Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multifunctional cans of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ propor@@ tion@@ ale increase .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease , in which the bones are used ) in women according to men@@ op@@ ause , where there is a risk for a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or influence of other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vit@@ amine supplements ) .
to avoid a matur@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , the patient may not take until after the first food intake of the day , the earliest after taking the tablet 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 is already separated from each other in pharmac@@ euticals , which are approved in the European Union , submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also led a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase of vitamin D reflection .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with a low vitamin D mirror was treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , lower ( 11 % ) than that of those who exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also submitted data to present that in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose contained exactly the dose which is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain ( muscle , bone or joints ) and symptoms of the digest@@ ive apparatus such as ab@@ dom@@ inal pain , pe@@ di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , si@@ der@@ ision , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( hat@@ ch ) , beaten ab@@ dom@@ en ( infl@@ ated stomach ) as well as aci@@ dic stim@@ uli .
in patients with any sensitivity ( allerg@@ y ) against al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D3 or one of the other components must not be applied for AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it may not be applied in cases of o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium @-@ level ) or in patients who cannot stand upright or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission approved the company Mer@@ ck Sharp &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. a permit for placing the placing on the market of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or influence of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vit@@ amine ) for the day .
the following indications are to be precise to reduce the risk of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should only be swal@@ lowed with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patient must not chew@@ ing the tablet or the tablet in mouth , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ ale Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before taking the tablet for 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. p@@ tic Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal ble@@ edings or surgical procedures in the upper gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , only be given ( see section 4.3 ) .
Ö@@ zy@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients under the taking of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( some were these heavy agents and required a hospital assignment ) .
the doctor should therefore inform attention to all signs and symptoms , which should be pointed out on possible mal@@ ign@@ ant reactions , and the patient must be referred to at the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al pain , or a new or retro@@ ster@@ n@@ age to recover the medicine and consult medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe mal@@ ign@@ ant effects seem to be increased in patients who does not require the medicine and / or take it after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms that refer to a mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions to be passed on and by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .

there are no data available to give the evidence of human phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a cold surgical procedure to reduce the risk of a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ y of the Kiev .
clinical estim@@ ation by the treatment doctor is decisive for the therapy planning at each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the patients are supposed to be instructed by taking a dose of a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning after they have noticed their ens@@ iti@@ y .
they should not take two tablets a day , but the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled week@@ day .
other diseases associated with the mineral metabolism ( like vitamin D defic@@ iency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be adequ@@ ately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before beginning of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ end@@ ron food and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some or@@ ale drugs may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate when they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients have to wait for at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron was taken together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs , without that clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to apply during pregnancy neither during pregnancy .
animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate does not allow an indication of damage to the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ y of the Kiev regime was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports are written by cancer patients , but was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis agents .
nevertheless , the ser@@ um @-@ cal@@ ci@@ um rose up to &lt; 8.0 mg / d@@ L ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the ser@@ um @-@ phosphate until ≤ 2,0 mg / l ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with a similar frequency .

Fit consisted of two plac@@ e@@ con@@ controlled trials , at which Al@@ end@@ ron was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily to either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily gift of Al@@ end@@ ron was reduced by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.9 % vs Pla@@ z@@ ebo 15,@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption related to an intraven@@ ous reference dose , the average oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron was 0,@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg to night and two hours before intake of a standardized breakfast .
the bio@@ availability decreased to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ end@@ ron was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis udi@@ en , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) could not be a clin@@ ically important variation of the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies on rats have shown that Al@@ end@@ ron is temporarily distributed according to intraven@@ ous gift of 1 mg / kg , but then spread rapidly into the bones or by the urine .
due to an intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , about 50 % of radio@@ active ingre@@ dient were eliminated in 72 hours with urine and little or no radio activity was found in the catch .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients who tran@@ splan@@ ted a kidney or liver tran@@ splan@@ ted to avoid a rep@@ ulsion of the tran@@ splan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft was already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously carried out studies with pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from the published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study was submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney tran@@ splantation , whereby the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f with pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared .
the key effects of the efficacy was the number of patients where the tran@@ spl@@ ant was dead after a treatment duration of one year ( by example , how often sought a renewed tran@@ spl@@ ant or re @-@ recovery of the di@@ aly@@ sis ) .
furthermore , more recent studies on 119 patients with kidney tran@@ splantation and 129 patients with liver tran@@ spl@@ ant were performed and examined , such as Adv@@ agra@@ f in comparison to pro@@ grave / pro@@ gra@@ ft of the body .

in patients with any sensitivity ( allerg@@ y ) against t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , mac@@ ro@@ lid anti@@ biotics ( such as ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in ) or one of the other components may not be applied .
patients and doctors must be careful if others ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken simultaneously with Adv@@ agra@@ f at the same time when the Adv@@ agra@@ f dose or the dose of the same drug may be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ ity @-@ intensive therapy and treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients , should arrange this medicine or change in immun@@ ity @-@ intensive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of system@@ ic exposure of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us this can lead to tran@@ spl@@ ants or to an increased incidence of adverse events , including sub @-@ or immune diseases .
patients should always retain the same t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; Modification of the regime or regime should be made only under the eng@@ m@@ asch@@ al control of an experienced medical device ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of a changeover to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us will remain .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be primarily based on clinical assessment of abor@@ tions and toler@@ ability in detail and on blood @-@ level regulations ( see below &quot; Recommend@@ ations
after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ agra@@ f , the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us valley level should be controlled before conversion and controlled over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , the system@@ ic exposure measured as valley level , with both for@@ ce@@ ors both with kidney stones and with le@@ ber@@ tran@@ splant@@ ated patients .
careful and repeated controls of the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after tran@@ splantation under Adv@@ oc@@ f to ensure adequate substance exposure in direct tran@@ spl@@ ants phase .
because T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low cle@@ aring , may take a adaptation of the Adv@@ agra@@ f @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
in case of the patient &apos;s first postoperative results , the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us treatment intraven@@ ously ( pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate on the production of a infusion solution ) can be initiated with a dose of approx .
use of the application for suppression of tran@@ spl@@ ants must be adher@@ ed to the immune system ; therefore , a maximum duration of oral therapy can not be specified .
dosage recommendations - kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant proph@@ yla@@ xis of the corne@@ al Adv@@ ant@@ y therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
additional dose adjustments may be needed later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can change in the process of stabil@@ ization of patients after tran@@ splantation .
dosage recommendations - liver tran@@ spl@@ ant proph@@ yla@@ xis of the corne@@ al Adv@@ ant@@ y therapy should begin with 0,@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
dose recommended - changeover from pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ agra@@ m must be converted to once daily intake of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f . this conversion has to take place in a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the whole daily dose .
kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant After a changeover of other immun@@ vi@@ val si@@ va to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day the treatment with the recommended initial dose for proph@@ yla@@ xis of Tran@@ splantation has to start .
heart tran@@ spl@@ ant For adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ m is a oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day once daily in the morning .
other tran@@ spl@@ ant cat@@ chers are no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in lun@@ ar , pan@@ cre@@ as and dar@@ kened patients , in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with intest@@ inal tran@@ spl@@ ants in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood mirror in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function The kidney function does not have influence on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , which may be assumed that a dose is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ance levels ) is recommended for calcul@@ ating the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) .
conversion from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Adv@@ agra@@ f In the transition from a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ - to a t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is cau@@ tion command ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the dam in full blood die the dose should be associated with clinical assessment of abor@@ tion and toler@@ ability in a single @-@ blood @-@ t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us valley level controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us valley level during the first two weeks after tran@@ splantation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ tal@@ es of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us should also be checked after conversion of pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ agra@@ f , Dos@@ is@@ custom@@ ization , modifications of immun@@ ity @-@ intensive therapy or in the same application of substances which could change the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ m is a medicine with a low cle@@ aring , adap@@ tations of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occ@@ ured .
the data in clinical studies make sure that a successful treatment is possible in most cases if the valley level should not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice the valley level of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is usually seen in the first time after liver tran@@ spl@@ ants usually within the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with kidneys and cor@@ tran@@ splan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac tran@@ spl@@ ants were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this resulted in serious adverse events , including tran@@ spl@@ ants or other side effects , which may occur in a consequence of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always retain the same t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; Modification of the regime or regime should be made only under the eng@@ m@@ asch@@ al control of an experienced medical device ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with tran@@ spl@@ ant tran@@ spl@@ ants , proved to be proven to other immun@@ otherapy than therap@@ ies , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ aining formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
to proph@@ yla@@ xis of the tran@@ spl@@ ants of adult tran@@ spl@@ ants in adult heart tran@@ spl@@ ants or tran@@ spl@@ ants in childhood are still no clinical data for the ret@@ aining formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
because of possible inter@@ actions that can lead to a reduction of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us level in blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical efficacy of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , the gest@@ ion of medic@@ ations which contain cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) , or other plant healing during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea is a particularly careful monitoring of the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ ming concentrations in the blood , as the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to severe fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , under pro@@ gra@@ f was described as a car@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opath@@ y chamber or se@@ um@@ hyper@@ t@@ rophy , which can also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical interference , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ ero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function , infections , fluid loading and oil .
like with other immun@@ ity p@@ ants the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes caused by suitable clothing or use of a solar protection with a high protection factor .
if patients who explo@@ red T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for pre@@ aches like head@@ aches , imp@@ aired awareness of consciousness , forces and tend@@ encies should indicate a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. for example ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f &apos;s hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ ert , l@@ act@@ ose is contained in patients with the rare her@@ edit@@ ary g@@ act@@ ose int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase defic@@ iency or glucose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ absorption special attention .
the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal medic@@ inal agents that are known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and therefore reduce the blood values of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
therefore it is recommended to change the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us - blood mirror with the same gift of substances which can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism , and to set the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintaining even equal concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .

pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic studies showed that the increase of blood levels mainly resulting from the elevated bio@@ availability of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , due to the inhibit@@ ing of the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal failure .
high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as it is used for acute re@@ mot@@ ions , can increase or lower the concentration of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .

Adv@@ ices is used for the treatment and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( a defic@@ iency of a defic@@ iency of factor VIII ) .
the dosing and frequency of the application ad@@ mits after that Adv@@ ance is applied for the treatment of ble@@ eding or prevention of ble@@ eding in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A suffer from a factor VIII lack which causes blood cl@@ auses such as ble@@ eding in joints , muscle or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but referred to a method designed as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell that was brought into a gene ( DNA ) , which is capable of establishing the human body @-@ factor VIII .
Adv@@ ata is similar to other medicines approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is unlike any other , so that the medicine contains no proteins and animal origin .
in three additional studies on patients with severe up to moderate ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined with surgical procedures as well as surgical procedures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study the efficacy of Adv@@ ices has been awarded with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ices ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , Py@@ ot@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies against factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate should not be used in patients who may be sensitive to human in@@ tra factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster@@ protein or one of the other parts .
in March 2004 , the European Commission approved the Company B@@ ax@@ ter AG a permit for placing the placing of Adv@@ ices in the entire European Union .
dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy are calculated according to the sever@@ ity of factor VIII defic@@ iency , after the place and the extent of blood and clinical development of the patient .
for the following di@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , a factor of VIII activity shall not fall under the specified plasma concentration ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and the acute not@@ ation have been removed .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk is passed over .
during treatment course , the frequency is administered to the controller and the frequency of inj@@ ections a reasonable determination of factor VIII plasma labels .
individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different sem@@ iconductor times .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis For long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of ble@@ eding in patients with severe hem@@ oph@@ ilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII per kg body weight at a gap of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected Factor VIII plasma activities are not achieved or if the blood is not ruled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to follow the inhibit@@ or for the inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the Factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic inter@@ actions must be affected .
the administration rate is to be addressed according to the patient &apos;s assessment , whereby the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alis@@ ing anti@@ bodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk is dependent on the largest and other factors within the first 20 ex@@ positions .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an unknown inhibit@@ or development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , re@@ occur ( low tit@@ re ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurr@@ ence of hem@@ oph@@ ilia A there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and n@@ urs@@ ing time .
the A@@ DR@@ s &apos;s greatest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) that have an higher risk to formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and sw@@ ing@@ arm ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare ( 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare ( frequency on the basis of available data not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected drop of blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII @-@ mirrors occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE infusion .
during the entire time , the blood cl@@ ots was maintained and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance rate showed adequate values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostic he@@ avier and moderate ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilia A ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ ors ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , on no of 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with a age of less than 6 years and diagnosed with moderate he@@ at@@ oph@@ ilia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) an F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
previously untreated clinical study showed 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) patients with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on traces of contamination of cont@@ amin@@ ant proteins was analyzed by the investigation of the antibody tit@@ res against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported adverse reactions .
one patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend than also a persistent peak of anti @-@ Ch@@ o cells , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that indicate an allergic reaction or a sensitivity .
in four patients the occurr@@ ence of Ur@@ ti@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin r@@ ash , and increased number of os@@ in@@ oph@@ iler gran@@ ul@@ o@@ tes were reported in several repet@@ itive product positions within the context of the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE has been reported on over@@ sensitive reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic / an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic / an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic reactions ( frequency ) .
the activated factor VIII operates as a c@@ of@@ ak@@ tor for the activated Factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X out of factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE have been carried out in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilia A ( basis value of factor VIII activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ etic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients or &gt; 10 years and are listed in Table 3 below .

based on the first approval of the data available , the CH@@ MP has further evaluated the benefits of risk @-@ risk , but in fact that safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has on the basis of the safety filter from A@@ DV@@ ATE , which requires a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited was officially distributed to the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) that the company takes its application for placing the placing of Adv@@ oc@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the chest , the brain , the bones or soft parts ( t@@ issues , the other structures in the body bin@@ ds and is based ) thereof .
this is a way of virus that genet@@ ically modified so that it can bear a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; which is so modified that there is no copies of themselves , and therefore no infections can solve in humans .
Adv@@ oc@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus permit the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 @-@ protein , which is made out of non @-@ def@@ ec@@ tives in the human body of the p@@ 53 gene , is usually used for the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can not be restored .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is not correct , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells may further grow and share .
the company placed data from a study with a study involving the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Krebs in the field of building , into bone and brain .
after the CH@@ MP has examined the answers from the company to the asked questions , some issues were un@@ explained .
based on the purchase of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP grants a list of questions which will be sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , the injection of Adv@@ oc@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore has been advantages to the patients .
the Committee further concerns relating to the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the security of the drug .
in addition , the company had not suff@@ ici@@ ently proved that I can be made in a reliable way , that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in @-@ in contact with the patient .
the company put the CH@@ MP not in knowledge , whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently has to participate in clinical studies or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ on@@ ate Use Use programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; modified substances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components immediately and the other slowly over a few hours will be released . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used for treating symptoms of seasonal rhin@@ itis ( h@@ ay b@@ ops , by an allerg@@ y against pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ al sw@@ elling ( infl@@ ated nose ) .
for adults and adolescents ages 12 and older , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze twice daily , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated , as soon as the symptoms , above all the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( stopped nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be found on the block@@ age of the nose .
the main effective measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the Heu@@ v@@ ein @-@ n@@ ymp@@ t@@ ome that were reported by the patient prior to the treatment and during 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , the patients had their symptoms every 12 hours in a di@@ ary and evaluated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all the h@@ ops @-@ n@@ ymp@@ t@@ ome , the patients reported that the Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze had fallen by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.9 % in patients who had p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % versus 26.@@ 7 % in patients who were Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( encoun@@ tered at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , an@@ ore@@ x@@ ie ( heart rate ) , phar@@ yn@@ g@@ itis ( thro@@ wer@@ ies ) , ill@@ itis , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nie ( sleep@@ iness ) , ins@@ om@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be sensitive to patients who may be sensitive to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine or one of the other constitu@@ ents , against ad@@ ener@@ able active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine for treating allergi@@ es ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze can also be used in patients who suffer from a bott@@ om@@ angle glaucoma ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for placing on the distribution of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is in the whole ( i.e. without cr@@ ush it , breaking or chew@@ ing ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied due to the lack of data for the in@@ solvency and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) not for children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , since long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine can take time .
after reducing the sw@@ elling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper re@@ spir@@ ators , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as a mono@@ therap@@ ist .
as aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also treated with patients who are treated with a mon@@ o@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , or within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy .
this is due to the alph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of p@@ seu@@ do@@ o@@ he@@ dr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ amine , Per@@ go@@ id , Lis@@ ot@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other Dek@@ on@@ gest@@ iv@@ a , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ ek , ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , ox@@ al@@ olin , etc . ) .
safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient &apos;s collection , and the data are not sufficient to discuss appropriate recommendations for dosage .
safety and effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with ren@@ al or liver function and are not sufficient to discuss appropriate recommendations for dosage .
the patients must be informed that the treatment during the occurr@@ ence of hyper@@ tension or a speed@@ ometer , or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhyth@@ mi@@ ds , nau@@ sea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a ampli@@ fication of head@@ aches ) must be set .
in the treatment of the following patient groups , patients with heart rhyth@@ mic patient • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in the An@@ am@@ nese , Diabetes M@@ ell@@ itus , blasphem@@ y , or bron@@ ch@@ rist in the Andes .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is made at least 48 hours prior to performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests to reduce anti@@ hist@@ amine otherwise positive reactions to indicators for skin reaction and reduce their extent .
in addition to clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , where ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , however , no clin@@ ically important inter@@ actions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
the results of the psych@@ edel@@ ic testing was no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and treated with placebo @-@ treated patients , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone or with alcohol was taken .
the enzyme responsible for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin was not yet identified , so inter@@ actions with other medicines can not be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hib@@ its and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of P gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the in@@ solvency of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities compared to the frequency of normal population .
since re@@ productive studies in animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ ical properties of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in the pregnancy .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases the patients can be found in very rare cases , which may cause impair@@ ment of traffic and ability to serve machines .
symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ no@@ e , reduces mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular disease ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , Hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ mor , Conf@@ lic@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ting .

a CN@@ S stimulation is especially likely to include at@@ rop@@ ine typical symptoms ( mou@@ th@@ rice , P@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ c@@ re and di@@ lem@@ at@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ) .
these include both the inhibit@@ ing of pro@@ inflamm@@ atory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ oph@@ ile as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the eagle @-@ selec@@ tivity to end@@ oth@@ el@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring ranges of flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective battles or tasks that are connected to the flies .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily has no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase of blood pressure , a speed@@ ometer or manifest@@ ations of a Z@@ NS .
1,@@ 248 patients were enrolled in the age between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , whereby 414 patients received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was determined using the overall weight for symptoms ( except for nas@@ al mu@@ zzle ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine over the 2 weeks treatment period .
effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with respect to the sw@@ elling effect , determined using the nas@@ al mu@@ zzle , was significantly higher than under a mono@@ therap@@ y@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 weeks treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
in the context of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is det@@ ec@@ table within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with healthy volunteers over 14 days the flow @-@ weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was reached in day 10 .
within a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ etic multi @-@ technical study , which was carried out with the formulation as tablet to healthy adult subjects , was found that four subjects disin@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine po@@ or@@ ly wor@@ ned .
a component @-@ interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ in is equivalent to the exposure of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ in bio@@ equivalent to exposure to an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity , tox@@ icity , tox@@ icity and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , the pre@@ defined clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine did not recognize any special haz@@ ards for humans .
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than their individual components , and the observed effects were generally in the context of the p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine content .
in re@@ productive tox@@ ic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine / p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was not liable in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies with an allerg@@ y rhin@@ itis in eight studies with allerg@@ y rhin@@ itis ( including four trials for seasonal rhin@@ itis and two studies on patients who also had As@@ thma ) .
the efficacy was measured by the change of symptoms ( it@@ chy , number and size of squares , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on days ) before and after six weeks treatment was determined .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to remove and the melting tablets in the same manner as tablets and application in children are un@@ think@@ able .
when allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us were observed an average decrease of symptoms ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 26 % compared to the patient who received a placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ ti@@ aria the decline of symptoms after six weeks treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to placebo treated with placebo treated .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be sensitive to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or one of the other parts .
in January 2001 , the European Commission approved the company SP Europe a permit for placing on the distribution of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to reduce symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience of clinical studies for efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine for young people aged 12 to 17 ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be terminated according to the current disease and may end after the symptoms of symptoms and their re@@ occur .
for persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended during the allergi@@ es time .
clin@@ ically important inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin pills , where ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ phar@@ yn@@ ological study , A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol was not reinforced ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , the patients should be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases the patients can be found in very rare cases , that may lead to impair@@ ment of the traffic or ability to serve machines .
for clinical studies in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ia , 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us were reported when patients who were treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events that were reported more frequently than placebo was ti@@ red@@ ness ( 1,2 % ) , mou@@ th@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 young people from 12 to 17 years the most common head@@ ache was treated with 5.9 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and in 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi@@ multi@@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were observed , no clin@@ ically important effects were observed .
this includes both the inhibit@@ ing of pro@@ inflamm@@ atory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ oph@@ ile as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the eagle @-@ selec@@ tively to end@@ oth@@ eli@@ al@@ gic cells .
as part of a clinical study with multiple outlets , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was administered over 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
for a single dos@@ sier study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring ranges of flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective battles or tasks that are connected to the flies .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective at the reduction of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z of the nose , Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z , tr@@ inal flow and red@@ ress of eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis can be divided into dependence on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
an inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
Per@@ sist@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week , and more than 4 weeks .
as shown by the total of the questionn@@ aire to life quality at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively weak@@ ened the pollution caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tik@@ aria became deputy for further forms of the ur@@ ti@@ aria , as the underlying Path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to e@@ ology in different forms and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited easier .
as the hist@@ amine bur@@ ial factor is expected in all ur@@ ti@@ cul@@ ari@@ al diseases , that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is expected to improve symptoms of ur@@ tik@@ aria as well as in other forms of the ur@@ ti@@ cul@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ is@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose intervals .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ia , the minority of the patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ amine from the study .
improvement of the jew@@ ellery by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and awareness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to assess these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics study , in which the patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis population , a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of patients .
there are no evidence points for a clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5 @-@ 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , however , has not yet identified that inter@@ actions with other medicines are not completely excluded
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hib@@ its and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of P gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .

the clinical trials performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , with a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quantitative differences with regards to the tox@@ ic@@ ulty of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
based on conventional studies for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity , tox@@ icity , tox@@ icity and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , preventive data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine do not recognize any special haz@@ ards for human beings .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken regardless of meals , to reduce symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pres@@ cription doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data suggest that support a treatment of inf@@ ectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper re@@ spir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ al@@ ies , the diagnosis should play an role in diagnosis , physical investigations and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of metab@@ oli@@ g@@ ad@@ ine is restricted and experienced a higher sub@@ jection load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the security of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years which metab@@ oli@@ zed in limited metabol@@ ites is identical to that with children who metab@@ oli@@ zed normal .

a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study was not reinforced with in@@ gest@@ ation of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the most efficient effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the total rigi@@ dity of the side effects of children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group similar to the placebo group .
for clinical studies with adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ti@@ co , were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us when patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multiple dose study on adults and adolescents , where up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were observed , no clin@@ ically important effects were observed .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 , who came to question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment , received a daily dose of 1,@@ 25 mg ( between the ages of 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the process of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tik@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is similar to adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be extra@@ pol@@ ated on the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study involving multiple outlets in adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day has been applied for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .

A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used to protect against flu caused by the trunk ( type ) H5@@ N1 of influenza A virus , should be applied .
this is a special kind of vaccine that could cause before a trunk of influenza , who could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
an influenza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks even if a new tribe of influenza , who can easily spread human beings , because human beings still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system acknowle@@ dges the vaccine contained in the vaccine as &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; and forms anti@@ bodies to it .
in this way , the immune system will be able to form an anti@@ qu@@ anti@@ bacterial antibody in contact with an influenza .
afterwards , the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on membrane surface , which det@@ ects the human body as body @-@ foreign ) , is cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine .
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of clinical data base to assess the vacc@@ ination of vacc@@ ines required to meet the requirements of the EMEA for preventive vacc@@ ines .

it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , with the human immun@@ ode@@ ficiency Syndrome ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which caused the acquired immun@@ ode@@ ficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot be swal@@ lowed up as a solution , but this cannot be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , as the safety of this combination was not examined .
A@@ gen@@ ase should only be instit@@ uted when the doctor has been tested , which has taken an@@ tivir@@ al medicines of the patient previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of the virus has to talk to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken up with twice daily 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines .
in children aged between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gen@@ ase is based on body weight .
in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines the HIV @-@ amount in blood and keeps them at low level .
AIDS is not to heal , however , the damage of the immune system and thereby regul@@ ate the development of AIDS associated infections and diseases .
A@@ gen@@ ase was examined in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , but without R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who were previously treated with prot@@ ease .
the drug A@@ gen@@ ase with low do@@ si@@ avi@@ r reinforced drug A@@ gen@@ ase was compared with 206 adults who compared with other types of protein .
primary inde@@ b@@ ator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ proven concentrations of HIV in the blood ( vir@@ al load ) or the change of vir@@ us@@ load after treatment .
in studies with patients who had previously taken no protests but had a vir@@ al load below 400 copies / ml under placebo for 48 weeks , but A@@ gen@@ ase was less effective as in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gen@@ ase also decreased the vir@@ us@@ load , whereby however , of the children who had been previously treated with prot@@ ease , only very few on the treatment languages .
in the study with adults who had been treated earlier with prot@@ ru@@ sters were treated with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced drugs A@@ gen@@ ase the vir@@ us@@ load after 16 weeks treatment just as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other protein @-@ inhibit@@ or , it came under A@@ gen@@ ase together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r into a stronger waste of vir@@ al load after four weeks as in the patient who continued its previous protests :
the most common adverse events of A@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gen@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be sensitive to am@@ b@@ am@@ r or one of the other parts .
A@@ gen@@ ase may not be used in patients , the cur@@ rant ( a herbal preparations for the treatment of depression ) or pharmac@@ euticals , which are equal to as A@@ gen@@ ase and are kept in high concentrations in the blood harmful .
like other medicines for HIV ( HIV ) patients who are a@@ gen@@ ase , the risk of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ on@@ ek@@ y ( ab@@ duction of bone tissue ) or of a immune re@@ activated ( symptoms of infection that are caused by the rest@@ or@@ atory immune system ) .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines prescribed in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for treating with inhibit@@ ors pre @-@ treated HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years .
A@@ gen@@ ase is usually taken together with the phar@@ yn@@ cr@@ in@@ et@@ ic amplifier R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the use of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase was originally approved as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information templates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission approved the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for placing on the distribution of A@@ gen@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gen@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , inhibit@@ or ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years .
for usually , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules shall be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic booster of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual vir@@ al resistance of resistance and treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take a 14 % less than one capsule . therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ ting on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis do not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ or@@ b@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
2 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the addition of the addition of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster packs ) , higher doses must be applied to a@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ or@@ b@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg am@@ ca@@ vi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics , efficacy and safety of af@@ ase in combination with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r or other protests were not examined at children .
A@@ gen@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years due to lack of data for the in@@ solvency and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ etic data , the dose to A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function distur@@ ban@@ ces to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be treated with severe or regular liver function with cau@@ tion , in patients with severe liver function , it is con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gen@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low @-@ therapeutic width and also sub@@ strate the sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations that contain cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) , may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a di@@ min@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should not be noted that A@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other comp@@ lications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy , including the treatment of A@@ gen@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of a transmission of HIV upon others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usually , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules shall be applied along with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy , an increased risk of severe liver preparations with potentially fatal course .
for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the related information about this medicine .
patients with existing limited liver function including chronic hepatitis active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver function in anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gen@@ ase and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ c@@ ason or other Glu@@ co@@ cor@@ di@@ ids , which is used via CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ost@@ ero@@ y effects including mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and support repression of the side function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the failure of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended for an simultaneous administration of A@@ gen@@ ase with Lov@@ e@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin due to increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ ol@@ sen .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , methods are used to determine the drug concentration .
for patients who use this medicine at the same time , A@@ gen@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma concentration of am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metab@@ olic inter@@ actions with am@@ ca@@ vi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ diction can be altered , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions .
if meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r , the patient should therefore be monitored in Op@@ tic sympt@@ om , especially if there are still low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the possible risk of a tox@@ icity of a tox@@ icity of the A@@ gen@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indications for children under a age of four years and should be used with cau@@ tion on certain other patient groups .
af@@ ase should be set at duration 5 if a skin r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms will be accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy , including protein @-@ inhibit@@ or , was reported about the occurr@@ ence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ emia or an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other disease related to their therapy , which are associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia in connection .
B. higher age , and with drug dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated with metab@@ olic disorders .
in hem@@ oph@@ ile patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with Prot@@ otypes , reports of an increase of ble@@ eding including spontaneous hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sen .
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ ity effect can develop a inflamm@@ atory reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ale opportun@@ istic infections , resulting in severe clinical trials or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a Multi@@ fac@@ tor@@ ial e@@ ology is adopted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ o@@ gens , higher Body Mass Index ) , were reported cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ y particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gen@@ ase may not have been given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ strate the sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gen@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r can not be used together with drugs , whose active ingredients are mainly related to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to the increased plasma quality with serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which may lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical linking and to a resistance development .
the attempt to re@@ treat plasma cutting through a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r were often observed , very often un@@ wanted effects of the liver were observed .
cur@@ ic@@ ul@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) The ser@@ um levels of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r can be decreased by simultaneous use of plant preparations with cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) .
if a patient takes care of cur@@ rant , the am@@ y@@ av@@ ir@@ st mirror and , if possible , check the vir@@ us@@ load and depos@@ ited the cur@@ rant of the cur@@ rant .
a dose custom@@ iz@@ able for one of the medicine is not necessary when clo@@ cked clo@@ avi@@ r together with am@@ or@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ o@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
508 % increased , for C@@ max by 30 % , if R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ or@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg am@@ or@@ b@@ r applied twice daily and r@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the effectiveness and in@@ solvency of this treatment scheme .
52 % lower when am@@ or@@ b@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ ath@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r in plasma was administered twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for the con@@ current administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to be a eng@@ m@@ asch@@ al monitoring , as the effectiveness and in@@ solvency of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ ical study on the application of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but is recommended that the revenue of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine is recommended that the revenue of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and A@@ gen@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
therefore in the gift of E@@ o@@ ir@@ ence in combination with am@@ or@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose is required .
treatment with E@@ o@@ ir@@ ence in combination with am@@ or@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , since the exposure of both prot@@ ease .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine was reduced to other types of inhibit@@ or and existing limited data , Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine could potentially lower the ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
if this medication should be used simultaneously , be careful when Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma .
if this medication should be applied together , be careful ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be performed , as an accurate forecast of the effect of combination of am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous processing of am@@ b@@ am@@ r and Ri@@ b@@ am@@ ut@@ in led to an increase in Plas@@ ma@@ Con@@ concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ b@@ ut@@ in at 193 % , and thus increase in associated side effects .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ b@@ am@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gen@@ ase will be given to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is required .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic studies with al@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in were not carried out , however the plasma cutting of both medicines can be increased in case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily resulted in an increase of the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day , compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous application of F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ ca@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be used together with A@@ gen@@ ase , possibly to inter@@ actions .
the patients should therefore be associated with toxic reactions to be monitored using these medicines , if they are used in combination with a@@ gen@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ rac@@ ists it is advis@@ able that ant@@ acids should not be taken at the same time as A@@ gen@@ ase , as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va that are known as an enzyme ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r can lead to a decrease of plasma concentration of am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r .
the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium @-@ channel blocks such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ aph@@ or pin , pin @-@ pin , Ni@@ ch@@ pin , Ni@@ ch@@ pin , N@@ os@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il could be increased 10 by am@@ or@@ b@@ r , thereby stim@@ ulates the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
simultaneous use of A@@ gen@@ ase can increase their plasma concentration and increased with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection with adverse events including hyp@@ ot@@ ics , tend@@ encies and prim@@ ap@@ hor@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study conducted in R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r 100 mg capsules two times daily along with 50 µg Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) , while the end@@ ogen@@ ous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % break@@ down interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous recording of A@@ gen@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r are not recommended together with these gluten co@@ cor@@ ti@@ ids , unless the potential use of a treatment is the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ i@@ ero@@ id effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which depends heavily from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronoun@@ ced from the plasma tor@@ ch at the same time of reducing gen@@ eric .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to my@@ opath@@ y , including a hab@@ it dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , the combined use of this medicine is not recommended .
it is recommended to increase the therapeutic concentration up to stabil@@ ization of the mirror , as the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us to be increased with the same gift of am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase may not be applied along with oral gen@@ om@@ men@@ em Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while the use of A@@ gen@@ ase with par@@ es@@ z@@ ol@@ am cau@@ tion is charged .
data on the simultaneous application of par@@ ent@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other types of inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma concentration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ on should be administered together with am@@ or@@ avi@@ r , the patient should therefore be monitored in Op@@ tic sympt@@ om , especially in addition to even low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the lower reliability of historical comparison , no recommendation can currently be given , such as the am@@ y@@ avi@@ r dose is to be given at the same time when am@@ y@@ avi@@ r is administered with meth@@ ad@@ on .
with the same gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gen@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ diction is not predic@@ table , therefore , alternative methods are recommended for conception .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ til@@ in ) is recommended with the same gift of A@@ gen@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful removal of potential use for the mother in comparison to the potential risks of fet@@ us .
in the milk @-@ activated rats , Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , however , it is not known that Am@@ ca@@ vi@@ r over@@ passes people in breast milk .
a re@@ productive study on tr@@ ash@@ boards , which was administered by the in@@ ni@@ st@@ ion in the uter@@ us until the end of the n@@ urs@@ ing time , showed a reduced increase of the 12 body weight in the offspring .
the further development of earnings , including fertil@@ ity and re@@ productive capacity was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r to the parent .
the in@@ solvency of A@@ gen@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with different other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
most with the A@@ gen@@ ase treatment associated side @-@ side effects were slightly damaged , occurred early and led rarely to treatment break .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with many of these events it is not clari@@ fied whether they are related to the medicine of af@@ ase or another &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV @-@ related medicines , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the side effects date origin@@ ate from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which the previously untreated patients received 1200 mg of A@@ gen@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were listed below the examination in connection with the study medicine and occurred in more than 1 % of patients , as well as under the treatment of treatment changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy was associated with HIV patients ( Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ) in HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of peri@@ pher@@ ical and fa@@ una fat , hyper@@ t@@ rophy of the breasts and dor@@ s@@ vi@@ al fat collection ( bul@@ ae ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not pre @-@ treated persons who had been treated with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / Z@@ id@@ ov@@ ud@@ in about a medium duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( bul@@ ae ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 patients treated with 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s patients ( 3 % ) compared to 27 patients ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s for a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .

cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ y were particularly reported in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ ity effect can develop a inflamm@@ atory reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ous opportun@@ istic infections at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gen@@ ase twice daily with low dose of adverse events ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which were observed under all@@ ot@@ yc@@ eri@@ des and CP@@ K values , which were among patients who received A@@ gen@@ ase together with low @-@ sufficient R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dosage the patient is to observe on signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary supporting measures .

the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is located in the range from 0,0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute cells and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the inhibit@@ ing of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication during human being is not defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ amp@@ vi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses have been observed - such as other R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r aff@@ oo@@ ed treatment schemes - described the mut@@ ations described only rarely .

the cover of the efficacy of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and nu@@ kle@@ ar sid@@ ad ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with lowest R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r . &quot; received .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ three and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gen@@ ase , at least one another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I have been included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis introduced the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ adjusted average change of the output value ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with non @-@ signatures of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the cover of untreated A@@ gen@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in studies , A@@ gen@@ ase solution was taken into doses of 15 mg / kg times daily , 20 mg / kg times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients 20 mg / kg twice daily .
it was not given a low do@@ si@@ fied R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of these patients treated with PI pre @-@ treated patients had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a media increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on these data should be considered as an expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ sealed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral dosing , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of am@@ ca@@ vi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased , for C@@ max reduced by 30 % , if R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered jointly with am@@ or@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ ca@@ vi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore the minimal concentration in the ste@@ ady @-@ state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food @-@ intake , although the simultaneous dietary intake has influenced the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be close to a large distribution volume , as well as an imper@@ ative penetration of am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r from blood circuit circuit in the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the substances in plasma , with the amount of un@@ born am@@ ca@@ vi@@ r which remains the active ingre@@ dient remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ broken am@@ ca@@ vi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingre@@ dient during the dosing interval of the Ste@@ ady State in the Ste@@ ady State exceeds the range from C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that contain CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ ing or in@@ hib@@ its or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be given to cau@@ tion if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gen@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg two or 15 mg / kg times daily , leads to a similar daily non @-@ b@@ lown exposure like in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bi@@ al as out of the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase solution and a@@ gen@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a million@@ th base .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the impact of a ren@@ al interference to the elimination of am@@ ca@@ vi@@ r and r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be low .
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r plasma plasma comparable to healthy volunteers according to a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ aders of o@@ cell@@ ular Aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been resolved and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for men is un@@ clear .
from the present study data on humans , both in clinical studies and from therapeutic use , however , little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings .

these liver tox@@ icity may be monitored and documented in clinical use by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
previously , no significant liver tox@@ icity was observed in clinical studies , neither during the administration of A@@ gen@@ ase even after the end of the treatment .
studies of tox@@ icity at young people who were treated at a age of 4 days showed both in the control and with am@@ or@@ b@@ r treated animals demonstrated a high mortality rate .

24 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the addition of the addition of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster packs ) , higher doses must be applied to a@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ or@@ b@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg am@@ ca@@ vi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be treated with weak or lighter liver function in case of patients with severe liver function , it is con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed ( see section 4.3 ) .

in other studies , there are not been carried out by a daily pre @-@ auth@@ ori@@ ous medication , two cases of serious Ph@@ im@@ osis and a case involving circumcision were observed .
in an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses there is an increased risk for heavy local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation were observed , which have a treatment required and / or to a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions were occurred on the output of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had difficulties when doing water , which require a emergency cath@@ eter and a treatment of the affected area .
in connection to the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following the treatment with other cut@@ aneous treatments for the treatment of external tra@@ jec@@ tives in the gen@@ ital and periods range , no clinical experience have been observed .
limited data indicate an increased rate of fung@@ al reductions at HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this group of patients .
the treatment of the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm to eyel@@ ids the nose , the lips or the shar@@ aran@@ ces was not examined .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions will be in general during therapy or reactions , form the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the complaints of patients or regarding the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break of several days can be made .
the clinical outcome of therapy can be assessed after the treatment of treated skins for 12 weeks after the treatment .
since there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , there should be certain appropriate therap@@ ies with super @-@ prop@@ els bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s there are no clinical experience , therefore the application should not recommended already pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours .
data from an open clinical study indicates that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7,@@ 25 cm2 ) a lower lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy exists .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ants on eyel@@ ids , inside of the nose or the ears , or in the lift area within the bed range .
there are only a limited data about application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od on the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis in poor and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application . therefore , such a such application is not recommended .
local skin reaction occur frequently , but these reactions usually take in the course of the treatment of intensity or go back after finishing the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the local skin reactions to the patients have a huge dis@@ comfort or very strong , the treatment can be suspended for a few days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 files can be reduced as a lower full recovery rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune stim@@ ulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with cau@@ tion in patients who received an immun@@ ity treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies do not go direct or indirect effects on the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / f@@ öt@@ ale development , accounting or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although neither based on one @-@ time history of anti@@ fiable ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) , no recommendation can be given during the stand@@ still time .
most frequently used and possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in connection with three weeks treatment were local reactions to the treatment of the treatment ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
the most frequently reported and possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the context of the side @-@ side effects include complaints at the application location with a frequency of 28,@@ 1 % .
the basis of 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated bas@@ ali@@ om patients from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of phase III reported adverse events are listed below .
the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the context of the side effects were a reaction on the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
the adverse events used in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
this according to the testing plan of clinical trials shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ tr@@ ori@@ ation / evenings ( 23 % ) and oil ( 14 % ) came to ( see section 4.4 ) .
according to the test plan , the assessment of clinical signs described in these studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is very frequent to severe path@@ ological topics ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sion ( 13 % ) , and severe break@@ down ( 19 % ) .
clinical studies for exam@@ ining the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od on treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis was found Alo@@ pe@@ zie with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment station or in the surrounding area .
the essential @-@ time image of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could cause nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ algia , and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effects , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ ony , which normal@@ ized according to oral or intraven@@ ous liquid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ etic examination , after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the system@@ ic concentration of the al@@ pha@@ bet and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine were detected .
in 3 piv@@ ot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete healing of the F@@ eig@@ n treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is clearly superior .
in 60 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in patients treated gra@@ dients . this was 20 % of the 105 patients treated with placebo in patients ( 95 % CI ) :
a full healing could be reached at 23 % from 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % from 161 patients treated male patients ( 95 % CI :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five hours of application a week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the targets of hist@@ ologically , hist@@ ologically confirmed individual prim@@ itive super @-@ cell car@@ cin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study showed that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) were healed of all treated patients and remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od at three times a week in one or two treatment time of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week @-@ treatment period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , discre@@ et , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ es within a program of 25 cm2 when using the un@@ fortun@@ ate header or in the face .
the budget data from two combined observation studies show for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods a recur@@ ren@@ al rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
the approved indications of external tra@@ des@@ ks , ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ elles al cell car@@ cin@@ oma occur usually at pairs at@@ ric patients normally and were not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream has been studied in four randomised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials to children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um Cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 576 , placebo n = 313 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies by the dos@@ ages ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively .
a minimum system@@ ic absorption of 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest pharmaceutical concentrations in the ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face of the face ( 12.5 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hand / poor ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated sem@@ inal half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ time after sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a former study ; this indicates a prolonged retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on system@@ ic exposure showed that the Res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low to MC @-@ associated skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years and comparable to healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fi@@ est@@ ly bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on the combined tox@@ icity at the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduce body weight and elevated mil@@ z weight ; a total of four months in the case of the mouse has no similar effects .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice was induced into three days a week , no tum@@ ors at the field of application .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but because I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low system@@ ic absorption of the human skin and is not suspected , is a risk for people because of the system@@ ic exposure .
the tum@@ ours were treated in the group of mice , which was treated with the real @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers as in the control group with lower U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used to treat patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ en@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ des ( MP@@ S I ; α @-@ l @-@ ion@@ ic defic@@ iency ) in order to treat the not neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or ner@@ ves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cer@@ amine og@@ ly@@ kan@@ e , G@@ ags ) will not be dismant@@ led , therefore in most organs in the body and damage this .
the following failed neuro@@ logical symptoms of MP@@ S I can occur : increased liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements are difficult , reduced lung volume , cardi@@ ac and eye disease .
treatment with algae az@@ ole should be monitored by a physician , the experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other inher@@ ited metab@@ olic diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or a clinic with res@@ am@@ eral units , and patients will need to prevent adequate medic@@ inal products , in order to prevent allergic reaction .

in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was investigated , however , its effectiveness was measured ( by decre@@ asing the reduction of G@@ AG concentration in urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was diagnosed in the urine in the urine of about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal sized liver at the end of the study .
the most common adverse events of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , ab@@ dom@@ inal pain ( joint pain ) , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ ies , pain in li@@ mb@@ s ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the infusion station .
very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , speed@@ ometer ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and sh@@ ook fro@@ st .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be sensitive to patients who may not react strongly ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other parts ( an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic reaction ) .
every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will update all new information that may be noted , and this summary will be updated .
the producers of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who observe al@@ az@@ ole , as regards reactions to infusion and development of anti@@ bodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company G@@ enzyme Europe B.V. An authorization for placing the placing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α @-@ l @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using a combin@@ ant DNA technology under the use of Ch@@ o @-@ Mamm@@ alog@@ ier cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ se , E@@ ier@@ stock of the Chinese ham@@ sters ) .

treatment with algae az@@ ole should be done by a physician , the experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other inher@@ ited metab@@ olic diseases .
the initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient is able to increase all 15 minutes in single steps at a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of algae az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years was not determined , and for these patients no dosing scheme is recommended .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ ations in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency was not determined , and for these patients no dosing scheme is recommended .
with algae @-@ related patients , patients may develop in@@ fu@@ sions @-@ related reactions , which are defined as any related conc@@ ep@@ tivity that occurs during the infusion , or until the end of the infusion of the infusion ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should continue to monitor eng@@ m@@ asch@@ ig , and the infusion of al@@ yp@@ az@@ ole should be carried out only in an appropriate clinical environment , in the revival equipment for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the Phase 3 clinical trial , nearly all patients Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies are formed against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the course of treatment .
patients who develop anti@@ bodies or symptoms of in@@ fu@@ zzy reaction must be treated with cau@@ tion by Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with cau@@ tion ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , must be careful due to the theoretical increased risk reaction after a inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the start of infusion with medic@@ ations ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ ka ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurr@@ ence of in@@ fu@@ zzy reactions .
in case of light or medium @-@ induced response @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to the half of the infusion rate when the response has occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fu@@ eled reaction , the infusion must be stopped , until the symptoms are accounted for , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considering .
the infusion is made with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the response has occurred to be resumed .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with intra@@ ocular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful impact on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data in new@@ bor@@ ns , who were exposed to Lar@@ onic P@@ umps on matern@@ al milk , is recommended to wear during treatment with algae az@@ ole .
the adverse events in clinical studies were classified mainly as in@@ fu@@ sions @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants of less than 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) were observed .
undes@@ ired pharmaceutical reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase 3 @-@ year period or older at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , are often listed in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with he@@ avier MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper re@@ spir@@ atory work and l@@ ungs in pre @-@ history , severe reactions appeared also , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ els , breathing @-@ breathing and visual acuity ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions in connection with algae az@@ ole , which were reported during a phase 2 study involving 20 patients aged under 5 , with predominantly severe acute form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , within 3 months after treatment , it was one of the patient &apos;s treatment , with a he@@ avier @-@ run shape , usually within a period of 5 years ( average after 26 days over 45 days at age ranged from 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature retirement from the study ) were not det@@ ective inhibit@@ ing ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay det@@ ec@@ table anti@@ bodies , among them 3 patients who never came to Ser@@ con@@ version .
patients with lack@@ ing up to low antibody levels indicated a robust lowering of G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n , while patients with high antibody tit@@ res was a variable reduction of G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal to low neutr@@ al@@ izing its activity in vitro , which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
the presence of anti@@ bodies did not appear in connection with the incidence of undes@@ ired pharmaceutical reactions , even if the occurr@@ ence of undes@@ ired pharmaceutical reactions were typically taken together with the formation of Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies .
the grounds for the enzyme of enzymes is in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the cum@@ ulative sub@@ strate and the prevention of a further accum@@ ulation sufficient restoration of the enzymes .
according to intraven@@ ous infusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase will quickly removed from circulation and cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely over Mann@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely over Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosphate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ ations were examined in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of the patients had been recru@@ ited from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where it received another 3,5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg of algae .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ st &apos;s treated patients from the placebo group to improve the lung function and the ability to determine which is shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in der@@ e@@ dur@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease of the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not significantly higher than this period clin@@ ically and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with an hepat@@ oma of the treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) up to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n ( µg / mg of cre@@ at@@ ine ) was detected , which remained constant at the end of the study .
regarding the hetero@@ gen@@ eous disease manifest@@ ation between the patient which was taken into account , clin@@ ically significant changes for five efficacy ( 58 % ) , movement of motion ( 22 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration of 9 patients ( 20 % ) were observed .
one @-@ year @-@ old open phase 2 study was conducted , mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of algae were examined at 20 patients , which were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with severe dec@@ lining form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to an increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in Har@@ n during the last 26 weeks .
in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z @-@ Score for these age group The younger patients with severe dec@@ lining form only limited or even no progress in cogn@@ itive development .
in a phase 4 study , examinations for the dynamic effects of various al@@ umin@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schem@@ ata were carried out on G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n , the liver volume , and the 6 @-@ minute test test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can present in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , an represented alternative ; however , it is not noted that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate all new information that are available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug may be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to older and less affected patients .
based on conventional studies for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at one @-@ time gift , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not recognize any special haz@@ ards for humans .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ plat@@ in ( from other medicines for cancer ) , which has not been canc@@ eled on other parts of the body , or spreads very slightly to other parts of the body . • Advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small cell lung cancer , who is not able to attack the cell epi@@ thel@@ ial cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is not treated with patients who had previously untreated , in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in and in patients who previously used other chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , used as sole therapy .
to reduce adverse events , the patient should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and foli@@ c acid ( vitamin B12 ) and foli@@ c acid ( vitamin B12 ) .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with cis@@ plat@@ in , or after the administration of cis@@ plat@@ in additionally an &quot; anti@@ em@@ et@@ ic &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent liquid removal ) .
in patients whose blood is changed , or with which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be reduced , reduced or reduced the dose .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed thus s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells .
the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in its active form goes lighter than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug with a longer activity of cancer cells .
for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ eli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study on 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which had previously been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( other medicines against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( a further drug against cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ plat@@ in had survived an average of 12.1 months , compared with 9.3 months during the sole administration of Cis@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy first survival compared with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared with 7.9 months at Doc@@ u@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies , cancer resulted in the cell epi@@ thel@@ ial cells in which cancer resulted in longer survival times during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. has granted approval for placing on the distribution of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each di@@ arr@@ he@@ a bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is collected and diluted with 0,9 % sodium chloride solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml . ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in is indicated for the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic col@@ onic car@@ cin@@ oma except for the majority of epi@@ thel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ oral car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( CO@@ F ) administered as an intraven@@ ous infusion for a period of 10 minutes a day of 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as infusion in a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate - infusion on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial car@@ cin@@ oma following the previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as an intraven@@ ous infusion for a period of 10 minutes a day of 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions a day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift as well as the day after treatment an cor@@ ti@@ ero@@ id will be given .
during the seven days before the first dose P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the intake must be continued during the entire treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate dose .
patients also need to receive a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after each third party cycle .
in patients who received P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , should be created before each gift a complete blood @-@ image should be created , including differentiation of leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a t@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ g@@ um .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose inspection must be taking place in consideration of the N@@ adi@@ rs of blood circulation or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the previous therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the notes 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute of Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 blood .
patients non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ Grade 3 should develop ( except ne@@ ural tox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient must be the value before treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dose reductions or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - at the occurr@@ ence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies showed no evidence that in patients aged 65 years or above , compared to patients aged 65 years , an increased by @-@ effect ris@@ i@@ - ko exists .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ adequate data for the integrity and effectiveness .
in clinical trials were not necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ ine Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dose adjustments that can go beyond all patients with recommended Dos@@ is@@ sions .
the data processing in patients with a cre@@ at@@ ine Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function limit of &gt; 1.5 times of the upper cut value values and / or trans@@ amin@@ ases of &gt; &gt; 3.0 times of the upper limit value ( at the presence of liver enzyme ) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver enzyme ) are not specifically investigated in studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to the bone mark@@ er mark@@ er and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be administered to patients before whose absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ic number reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the t@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te number once again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ en@@ number , thy@@ bo@@ zy@@ g@@ inal number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity such as neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia was observed when a pre @-@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B12 took place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treated patients , foli@@ c acid and vitamin B12 as proph@@ yl@@ - l@@ actic measure to reduce the reduction related tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must be avoided during therapy for at least 2 days before the therapy , at least 2 days before therapy , at least 2 days after therapy with pe@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who are intended for therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , must be avoided by N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long sem@@ esters for at least 5 days prior to therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients where these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including expansion hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
therefore in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid accum@@ ulation in the trans@@ cell@@ ular space a dra@@ ining of the capture in front of the P@@ em@@ etric treatment should be treated .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ed living substances ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is con@@ tra @-@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible break@@ er of the re@@ productive capacity by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before treatment - to obtain advice regarding sperm cells .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses can lead non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ log@@ ist@@ ika ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ ylic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) to a reduced impact of adverse reactions .
therefore cau@@ tion is charged if patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ ine Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ ylic acid are applied in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , at the day of therapy and minim@@ ally ( see section 4.4 ) .
as no data in regard to the inter@@ ventions potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life time such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ des , the simultaneous application must be avoided with P@@ em@@ et@@ rides for at least 5 days prior to therapy , at least 2 days before therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the major in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the od@@ or status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ ic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring rate of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient &apos;s du@@ cks with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pigs , but as with an@@ de@@ br@@ ated anti@@ metabol@@ ites are expected to become serious native defects in pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary , and after careful handling of use for the mother and risk of use for the mo@@ ckers ( see section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage of the re@@ productive capacity by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment begins to obtain advice regarding the sperm cells .
it is not known that P@@ em@@ et@@ bo@@ xed in breast milk goes and un@@ wanted effects when gest@@ ed mamm@@ oth cannot be excluded .

Alo@@ xi is used for chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cis@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , dex@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid ( a medicine that can be used as anti@@ em@@ et@@ ical ) .
the application in patients under 18 years is not recommended to show the effects in this age group .
this means that the active ingre@@ dient defined by a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi has been studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , which are strong and moderate re@@ acting for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
for chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi have no vom@@ iting in 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 by 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 126 from 221 ) .
for chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi have no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 153 from 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) .
in comparison with dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a approval to the Company of Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals and a permit for placing Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in strong em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy , due to cancer disease and vom@@ iting nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting with moderate chemotherapy , due to cancer disease .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi on the prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strong em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ ile chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can leng@@ then pro@@ found col@@ o@@ gens should be monitored using an am@@ nesty Ob@@ stip@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection of injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 @-@ Ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , cau@@ tion is charged with the same gift of palm on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with drugs used to extend the Q@@ T intervals or to an extension of such extension .
except in connection with other chemical agents , Alo@@ xi should not be used to treat nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in those days after chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( cis@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , Cy@@ clo@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) investigated .
in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of pall@@ et@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady concentration of met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population based on a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic analysis showed that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one , r@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , r@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Chin@@ id@@ in , Ran@@ kings , R@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences on the application of palm on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies lie not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied for pregnant women , unless it is necessary by the treated doctor than necessary .
in clinical studies , the most commonly used with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams showed adverse events ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were possibly associated with Alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ taining ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of excess reactions and reactions on the administration of the administration ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing report .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar cases demonstrated to adverse events such as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose of active relationships .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis probably does not have any effective therapy at a Alo@@ xi@@ - Over@@ do@@ ge .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies were earned a total of 1,@@ 132 patients with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cis@@ plat@@ in , Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ or@@ ron ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) received intraven@@ ously per day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , 667 mg / m2@@ Cis@@ plat@@ in were randomised , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azine plus 250 or 750 micro@@ gram Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received patients who received 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron , which were intraven@@ ously to day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strong p@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy are combined into the following tables .
in clinical studies for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings of clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the I@@ on@@ enk@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation that participated in the vent@@ ri@@ cular channels and extend the duration of the action potential .
the study of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. ab@@ ated palm on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in individual doses of 0.25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After an intraven@@ ous gift is followed by an initial acceptance of plasma concentrations a long @-@ elimination from the body with an average terminal time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 m / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
following an intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses between day 1 and day 5 measured median ( ± SD ) increase in pall@@ et@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
in pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ etic sim@@ ulations revealed that at once a daily intraven@@ ous gift of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) which was comparable to a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ max was 0.@@ 75 mg higher .
about 40 % are eliminated over the kidneys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies for metabolism have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 along the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are involved .
elimination According to an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours of urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an unchanged active ingre@@ dient made about 40 % of the given dose .
following a single @-@ time intraven@@ ous membrane in healthy , the overall body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al cle@@ aring 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in case of patients with severe liver function the terminal Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ allow time and average system@@ ic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron is increased , however , reduction of the dose is however not justified .
in previous clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that indicates a sufficient relev@@ ance of clinical use in clinical use .
10 A clinical studies showed that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of I@@ on@@ ite channels , which may be involved in the vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - und repression .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose were given in about 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given every day over two years , led to a multiple frequency of liver tum@@ ors , hyp@@ p@@ itu@@ res , pan@@ cre@@ as , sp@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors with rats , but not with mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not known , but due to the used high doses and when Alo@@ xi is determined in humans for a unique application , the relev@@ ance of these results will be small .

June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report that was approved for the treatment of hepatitis C treatment for the treatment of hepatitis C treatment by the treatment of hepatitis C / ml injection solution .
this means that Alp@@ he@@ on should resem@@ ble a biological pharmac@@ euticals called Ro@@ feron @-@ A with the same surgery , which is supposed to be approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference ort &quot; ) .
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long an@@ hal@@ ide ) hepatitis C ( a vir@@ al infection caused by vir@@ al infection ) .
in a micro@@ scop@@ ic examination , the liver tissue is damage to the liver , the values of the liver enzymes are Al@@ an@@ in@@ - Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increases in the blood .
it is produced by yeast , into which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the active ingre@@ dient .
the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on submitted data to demonstrate the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ feron @-@ A ( efficiency structure , composition and purity of medicines , action , safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alp@@ he@@ on was compared to the efficacy of the reference to 455 patients .
in the study , the study was measured as many patients after 12 out of 48 hours of treatment and 6 months after setting the treatment to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this Document is Author@@ ised for non @-@ commerce business . what were the biggest concerns that invol@@ ve the proposal for placing on the market ?
furthermore , concerns relating to the stability of the substances and of the products have not been sold shortly afterwards .
the number of patients with hepatitis C that talked to the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ feron @-@ A were similar in clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on , the disease was flamm@@ able in more patients than the reference to the reference ; moreover , Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects .
in addition , the test was included in the study test , in what extent the drug form a immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibody - specific proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficient .
it may be used for the treatment of Imp@@ et@@ igo ( a pro@@ pul@@ sion of inter@@ mitt@@ ance ) and small in@@ infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ or or chi@@ ves ) , can be used to sc@@ anned and har@@ sh wo@@ unds .
Al@@ lo@@ go should not be used for the treatment of infections , which have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) because al@@ go against this kind of infections might not work .
Al@@ lo@@ go can be used in patients with the age of nine months , but patients may not be more than 2 % of the body surface under the age of 18 .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient and examine alternative treatments .
it works by block@@ age of bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( parts of the bacter@@ ias cell , in which proteins ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
chief indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies in the proportion of patients whose infection had dropped to the end of the treatment .
119 patients ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under alt@@ ar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo had their treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin cells , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together during skin wo@@ unds , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups participated in the treatment .
however , in these two studies , Al@@ tar@@ go has detected that Al@@ tar@@ go has caused hollow ceilings in body fabric or infections , which have been demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by M@@ RSA , not effective enough .
the most common adverse events with alt@@ ar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a matur@@ ation of the client .
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Organ@@ izations ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go during a short @-@ time treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections exist : • Imp@@ et@@ igo , the infected small la@@ er@@ ations , sc@@ anned , or inclined wo@@ unds .
in May 2007 the European Commission approved the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a permit for placing on the market of Al@@ lo@@ go into the entire European Union .
the patients where no improvements could be observed within two to three days , should be considered once again and an alternative therapy can be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of sen@@ si@@ bil@@ isation or serious local irrit@@ ation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is supposed to make the treatment carefully and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection are begun .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used for the treatment of infections in which M@@ RSA is known as path@@ ogen , or thought ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies in secondary in@@ ert , the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was in@@ sufficient for patients with infections , caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) , un@@ sufficient .
an alternative therapy is supposed to be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment , no improvements or deteri@@ oration of the infected place .
the effect of simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means of the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations , which were reached after human application on the di@@ ced skin or infected surface , a clin@@ ically relevant inhibit@@ ing in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After a continuous gift of 2 times a day 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the average ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be to the poor skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients can not be maintained if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systematic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive tox@@ icity according to oral intake and are in@@ sufficient in relation to a statement on the birth and the f@@ öt@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy , when an top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly inde@@ xed and the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of an system@@ ic anti@@ bi@@ otic treatment .
during the decision whether the breast@@ plate continued / ends or terminated with Al@@ lo@@ go / terminated , is between the benefit of the n@@ urs@@ ing and to the benefit of the al@@ ar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials over 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the al@@ ar@@ go was used , the most frequently reported side effects on the administration , which is about 1 % of patients .
the action ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a half synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ rom@@ util@@ in , a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ ilus pas@@ se@@ ck@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ anus ) .
the action mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a given binary point of the 50s sub @-@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes which differs from the binding of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the ties of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L3 is involved in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ ties and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ring centre .
by li@@ aison to this Bin@@ der P@@ leu@@ rom@@ util@@ ine , pep@@ tide @-@ blocks , block @-@ part inter@@ actions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
due to the local preval@@ ence of resistance , the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear in at least some inf@@ ection forms , a consultation should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin opposite S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ate sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in were .
in case of non @-@ appe@@ aling to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ators ( like PV@@ L = P@@ ate @-@ Valentine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was released daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ts twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary in@@ treated wo@@ unds , single plasma were gained .
sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic recording at human application was reduced to 200 cm2 ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ ing .
Met@@ abol@@ ism The Met@@ abol@@ ism in vitro oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ism in human liver micro@@ som@@ en was primarily convey@@ ed by CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies for oral tox@@ icity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out more than 14 days , there were signs of adapted liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro review of gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test , or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats micro@@ core test for in @-@ vi@@ vo investigation chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were neither in male nor female rats at oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thereby achieving an up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure of human beings ( top@@ ical application to 200 cm2 ) ;
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity study on rats were determined at oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 times of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development of development tox@@ icity ( reduced body weight ) and matern@@ al tox@@ icity .

am@@ bi@@ rix is used for the protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , who are not immune to these two diseases .
am@@ bi@@ rix is applied within the framework of an existing vacc@@ ination plan , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Am@@ bi@@ rix can only be used when immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection , which can be brought to the end of two doses .
if a review dose is required against hepatitis A or B , Am@@ bi@@ rix or other Hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines can work with the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , &quot; how it can wake up against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immun@@ ological system identi@@ fies viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and creates anti@@ bodies .
since 1996 , Am@@ bi@@ rix contains the same components such as the Twin@@ rix adults and has been approved by Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same disease , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix are given an existing vacc@@ ination program within three doses .
because Am@@ bi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as a cover for the application of Am@@ bi@@ rix .
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody in one month after the last injection .
in an additional study of 208 children , the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between two inj@@ ections .
Am@@ bi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection for development of anti @-@ antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Am@@ bi@@ rix was similar in a six @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Am@@ bi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ aches , appet@@ ite , pain on the injection point , red@@ ness , ti@@ ghtness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
am@@ bi@@ rix may not react sensitive to patients who may react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to active ingredients , one of the other parts or Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ chi@@ s.@@ a. a permit for placing the placing on the placing of Am@@ bi@@ rix in the entire
the standardis@@ ed plan for the Grun@@ dim@@ entation with Am@@ bi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , with the first dose to choose between six and twelve months after the first dose is administered .
if a review imp@@ aired for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ izing vacc@@ ines or with a combined vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti@@ bodies are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ izing vacc@@ ines .
it is not completely secured whether immun@@ oh@@ ated persons who are addressed to an Hepatitis A@@ - vaccine , as it may also be protected against immun@@ ological memory through the immun@@ ological memory .
3 As for all inj@@ ections , the rare case of an an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic reaction , according to the gift of the vaccine , appropriate options for medical treatment and monitoring is always available immediately .
if a faster protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended that the 360 ELISA units form@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ able Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in hem@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ HAV@@ ER and anti @-@ h@@ BS anti@@ bodies were observed , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines can be required .
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to an optimal impact fol@@ g , these injection routes should be avoided .
in these cases , Am@@ bi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected directly at Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ t@@ open@@ ie or blood cl@@ auses , as it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration .
when Am@@ bi@@ rix was in the second year of a separate injection of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ an , tet@@ an@@ us@@ o@@ rem and Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilus influenza type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ se@@ am vaccine was given to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients with immun@@ ode@@ gra@@ sive therapy or patients with immun@@ ity defects must be assumed that may not have sufficient immune response .
in a clinical study carried out with 3 vaccine doses of this formulation , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ ache and fever comparable to the incidence that was observed in the previous Thi@@ omer@@ ano@@ - and preserv@@ ative vacc@@ ination .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines of Am@@ bi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to and including 15 years , Am@@ bi@@ rix was compared to the toler@@ ability of Am@@ bi@@ rix with the 3 @-@ component combination easier .
only excep@@ tions were the higher number of pain and pain on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination dose of Am@@ bi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Am@@ bi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % of the subjects , compared with the gift of a dose of 3 doses combination .
after the complete vacc@@ ination of vacc@@ ination reported 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects , Am@@ bi@@ rix had given to pain , over 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects , which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dosage combination .
the frequency of matter , however , was comparable ( i.e. about the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of the subjects , Am@@ bi@@ rix was compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects that received the 3 @-@ doses combination easier ) .
the incidence of pre@@ operative pain and pain was low and comparable to the administration of combination with the 3 @-@ cans vaccine was observed .
in a comparative study of 1- to 11 years of vacc@@ ines , the occurr@@ ence of local transactions and general inter@@ actions in the Am@@ bi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to the study involving the three @-@ doses combination with 360 ELISA units and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
however , for the 6- to 11@@ - year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with am@@ bi@@ rix , a common occurr@@ ence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , is reported annually .
the share of vacc@@ ines resulting from severe adverse events during the 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination with am@@ bi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination with the combination of hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis @-@ B@@ - surface an@@ tigen was not different .
in clinical studies that were conducted at vacc@@ ines at ages 1 to and including 15 years , the service rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % were issued one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , for month 6 ( i.e. , month 7 ) .
the service rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS was 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , for month 6 ( i.e. , in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study , which was conducted in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Am@@ bi@@ rix and 147 were treated with three doses of combined combined with three doses .
in the 289 persons whose immun@@ ity was valuable , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher than hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 in the gift of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine significantly higher than with Am@@ bi@@ rix .
the immune response , which were reached in a clinical study of 1 to 11 year @-@ old one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines required either a 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination with am@@ bi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
people who were employed at the time of Grun@@ dim@@ pl@@ ization between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HAV@@ ER and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ bodies could be demonstrated at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Am@@ bi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine scheme .
the immune reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to which was determined according to vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination simple , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study of 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HAV@@ ER and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ bodies could be similar to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine is comparable to the vacc@@ ination of 0 @-@ 12 months .
when the first dose of Am@@ bi@@ rix was in the second year of life simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ an , tet@@ an@@ us@@ o@@ rem , type b vaccine vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined mask M@@ umps @-@ vacc@@ ines was administered , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study , which was performed with 3 doses of the present formulation of adults , showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ rate rates as for the previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be investigated both before and after the res@@ us@@ ance on any foreign particles and / or physi@@ cally visible changes .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transferred to vir@@ al foodstuffs and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways like bathing in through wast@@ ew@@ ater waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a big face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require stationary treatment .
like all vacc@@ ines , Am@@ bi@@ rix can not protect completely from an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even when the full vaccine series was completed with 2 doses .
if you have been infected / your child before the administration of both vacc@@ ines Am@@ bi@@ rix are already infected with hepatitis @-@ A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus ( although you can &apos;t feel un@@ likely or sick ) , a vacc@@ ination cannot prevent illness .
a protection against other infections which may cause the liver or symptoms that are similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , which may not be convey@@ ed .
• If you have an unusual or allergic reaction to am@@ bi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by ju@@ ck@@ ering skin irrit@@ ation , breathing , or sw@@ elling of the face or tongue . • When with you / your child already occurred an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , where you have / your child have a severe infection with a fever .
• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the administration of the second vacc@@ ines required ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will give you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with am@@ bi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend to you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective hepatitis C virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine is usually given to a month after the first dose , and should give you a vacc@@ ination of vacc@@ ination before ending the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Am@@ bi@@ rix is suffering from persons who are suffering from severe blood disorders , under the skin and not into the mus@@ cle . • If you have weak@@ ened your child under a disease or treatment in your / her body &apos;s body / is , or if you have / her child under a ha@@ w@@ aly@@ sis .
am@@ bi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons can be in@@ sufficient , so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strongly the reaction is on vacc@@ ination .
21 Do you receive your doctor if you receive / your child further medicines ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without ce@@ asing ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated without ce@@ asing / or im@@ pregn@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( anti@@ bodies ) have been given to / or have been planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine is given at the same time with am@@ bi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible as various li@@ mb@@ s .
when Am@@ bi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of im@@ pregn@@ an@@ cies , it is likely that the response to the vaccine is still enough .
usually , am@@ bi@@ rix pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating women is not given , except it is ur@@ gent necessary that they are vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Am@@ bi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ bi@@ otic ) once a allergic reaction .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , please talk with your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible .

am@@ bi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which have been announced since the issu@@ ance of the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP has shown that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Am@@ bi@@ rix remains positive .
since Am@@ bi@@ rix was only transferred to a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited to low patient exposure .
am@@ am@@ aps may also be used in patients with in@@ complete enzyme faul@@ ty or hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic en@@ cep@@ halia ( brain compensation due to high protein concentrations ) in the pre @-@ history .
am@@ mon@@ oun@@ ce is split into meals - split by several single doses of meals - l@@ lu@@ ded under the food or via a gast@@ ric acid ( through the stomach @-@ leading hose ) or a no@@ bl@@ onde ( through the nose into the stomach @-@ leading hose ) .
there was no comparative study because of the am@@ mon@@ oun@@ ce could not be compared to placebo ( a medic@@ inal medicine , i.e. without substance ) .
am@@ am@@ aps may also lead to app@@ eals loss , a s@@ nor@@ ms of ac@@ idity , head@@ aches , head@@ ache , liquid pain , flav@@ our@@ ism , pain , nau@@ sea , const@@ ip@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , irre@@ plac@@ eable body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the am@@ mon@@ g of am@@ plitude was effectively effectively in patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ur@@ inary cycle .
under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; as due to the condition of the disease at the time of approval , only limited information to this drug templates .
the use is inde@@ xed in all patients where a complete enzyme has already been manifested in new@@ born age ( within the first 28 life @-@ days ) .
in patients with late mani@@ fold form ( in@@ complete enzyme defective , which is manifested according to the first life of life ) there is a indication for the use when in the An@@ am@@ nese a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic En@@ cep@@ tional encephalopath@@ y .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low up tablets or for patients with hat@@ ch disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in Gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated considering the protein tolerance and the development of necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with a body weight over 20 kg and with her@@ b@@ ite and adults .
for patients who suffer from an early mani@@ fold lack of car@@ cin@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ yl@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ sc@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ y@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with a arg@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ ine synthetic defic@@ iency need Ar@@ gin@@ ine defic@@ iency in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are not given to patients with hat@@ ch distur@@ ban@@ ces , as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us cr@@ ush , if the tablets do not reach immediately in the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , corresponding to the maximum daily dose .
therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used to treat patients with con@@ gest@@ ion in@@ suff@@ iciency or he@@ avier ren@@ al failure , as well as with sodium and oil formation only with cau@@ tion .
because Met@@ abol@@ isation and de@@ position of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat about the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used in patients with liver or kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore con@@ tra @-@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
with sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ ons and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there were also a delayed tire of cer@@ eb@@ r@@ ational syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional ner@@ ve obligations in the brain and thereby an han@@ dicap of brain growth .
it could not be found that phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is eliminated in the breast milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during the stand@@ still time ( see 4.3 ) .
clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS came out at 56 % of patients with at least an un@@ wanted event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from a 18 @-@ year @-@ old ano@@ des@@ kt@@ ic patient who developed a metab@@ olic En@@ cep@@ an in combination with l@@ act@@ azi@@ de , severe mort@@ ar open@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
a case of over@@ dosage occurred in a 5 @-@ month @-@ old small child with an interesting single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms occur with the accum@@ ulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate , which showed an intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ anal neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is a metab@@ oli@@ ic active compound which is con@@ jug@@ ated by ac@@ et@@ yl@@ amine with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is left over the kidneys .
stress bi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both connections contain 2 nit@@ ric at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to be over@@ coming from excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium bic@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0.15 g Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
it is of importance that the diagnosis was early and the treatment started immediately to improve the survival chances and the clinical outcome .
the forecast of the earliest mani@@ fold form of the disease with occurr@@ ence of the first symptoms in the new@@ born age was almost always inf@@ aust , and the disease led itself in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with its nitrogen @-@ free anal@@ ogues for the first year of life .
by Hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the util@@ isation of alternative way of nitrogen oxide ( sodium de@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium bic@@ ide and toxic amino acids ) , it was possible to increase survival rate as recent at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life month ) to increase diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients the survival rate was 100 % , but even in those patients with many intellectual disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with late mani@@ fold form of the condition ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ sc@@ yl@@ ase @-@ defic@@ iency ) , which were treated with an hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic En@@ cep@@ tible y and afterwards permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a prot@@ ein@@ ed diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
existing neuro@@ logic defic@@ its are hardly ir@@ reversible in treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
it is known that Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney disease with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were obtained after the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in an empty healthy adult and in patients with interference of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabolism was also examined for cancer patients according to intraven@@ ous gift of sodium chloride ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate .
after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablets , 15 minutes after the intake of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cycli@@ c distur@@ ban@@ ces or hem@@ oph@@ il@@ e@@ opath@@ ies was det@@ ec@@ table according to different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning , no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate in plasma .
three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) were treated with the mean Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate concentration in plasma concentration on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts .
the medication is eliminated in 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine via the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium chloride was not treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken or@@ ally taken ( mamm@@ als and children who can &apos;t swal@@ low up tablets or patients with hat@@ ch disorders ) or by a gast@@ ric acid or Nas@@ en@@ onde .
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with a body weight over 20 kg and with her@@ b@@ ite and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins should be kept within the normal range .
for patients who suffer from an early mani@@ fold lack of car@@ cin@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ yl@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ sc@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ y@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , corresponding to the maximum daily dose .
when R@@ atten@@ ed was exposed to Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate ( active metast@@ asis of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyr@@ am@@ id cells of the Hir@@ n@@ r@@ inde .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from a 18 @-@ year @-@ old ano@@ des@@ kt@@ ic patient who developed a metab@@ olic En@@ cep@@ an in combination with l@@ act@@ azi@@ de , severe mort@@ ar open@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
stress bi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both connections contain 2 nit@@ ric at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to be over@@ coming from excess
based on analysis of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium bic@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0.15 g Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
existing neuro@@ logic defic@@ its are hardly ir@@ reversible in treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after the intake of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the completed product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
with this approach the small measuring spoon 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient must receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved before use in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot be able to absor@@ b proteins in the body after consumption of proteins in the body .
if you study laboratory tests , you must take the doctor to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you have taken other medicines , or have recently taken other medicines , even if it is non @-@ pres@@ cription drug .
during stag@@ n@@ urs@@ ing time , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine could go over the breast milk and could hurt your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , head@@ ache , taste distur@@ ban@@ ces , emp@@ iri@@ cal distur@@ ban@@ ces , memory problems and deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ log@@ ically states were observed .
if you determine one of these symptoms , check out immediately with your doctor or with the not@@ ion of your hospital for the purpose of appropriate treatment in connection .
if you forget the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the corresponding dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute Cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ ms &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply ) ( a form of pain in breast basket with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( a an@@ om@@ al measurement value of electro@@ cardi@@ ology or EC@@ G ) .
an@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who are subjected to a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this may contribute to the heart of maintaining a blood flow in patients with Ang@@ ina or cardi@@ ac disease and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
close to 14 000 patients participated in the main study about the treatment of ACS at the treatment of an@@ gi@@ ox in sole gift or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , a different medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with a conventional combination treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI the patient was often used a st@@ ent ( a short sleeves that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a clasp ) and they received additional medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in .
at the treatment of ACS was an@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift of G@@ PI - with the prevention of new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ac disease or Rev@@ as@@ cular@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who under@@ go a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox worked as effective in all indicators as effective as Hep@@ arin , except for severe ble@@ eding , with which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin .
An@@ gi@@ ox cannot be used in patients who may be sensitive to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other brain cases or other parts of the other .
it may not be used in patients who recently had a blood of blood , as well as with people with strong blood pressure or heavy kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is a replacement for Hep@@ arin .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a permit for placing an@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute gra@@ on@@ ar@@ act ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / NGOs ) with a emergency handle or when an early intervention is fore@@ seen .
the recommended initial dose of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous type of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if one result is performed in another result , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg and the infusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI requirements , the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h may be recorded for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg must be administered , followed by an infusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial IV inhibit@@ or of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous infusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and efficacy of an all@@ ot@@ ox@@ ical gift of an@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second grade of 0.3 mg / kg / kg must be eff@@ ected .
in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and diluted medicine before application should be carefully mixed and the closing dose quickly administered intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value exceeds more than 225 seconds , a further surveillance is no longer necessary , provided the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly .
for patients with medium @-@ severe kidney disease ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which is subjected to a PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS is treated or not ) , a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , the ACT is administered at 0.3 mg / kg and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose .
in patients with moderate kidney compensation , which led to the Phase II I@@ - PCI trial ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) which led to the approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dose efficiency at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney compensation ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ tic patients the an@@ gi@@ ox contra@@ indications ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with an@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after finishing the intraven@@ ous gift of un@@ fra@@ c@@ ated Hep@@ arin or 8 hours after the termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of Dutch Hep@@ arin .
• Fo@@ c@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity of the active ingre@@ dient or other components or against mil@@ ud@@ ine • active blood disorders or increased blood risk disorders . • he@@ avier un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial end@@ omet@@ ry . • severe kidney compensation ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis required patients
patients are carefully examined during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of blood , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in was administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if using existing PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most blood vessels of arter@@ ial points may occur in patients who occur in a per@@ cut@@ aneous Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) , while the treatment is primarily associated with ble@@ eding .
in patients who are treated with war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a monitoring of IN@@ R @-@ value ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) should be observed in order to ensure that the value reached after setting the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in again before treatment of existing levels .
starting from the knowledge of the action mechanism of anti@@ bacterial ul@@ ants ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ na aggreg@@ ates ) can be assumed that these effic@@ ien@@ cies increase the risk of blood .
in the combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ders or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are clinical and organic hem@@ atology parameters in any case regularly .
the experimental studies are contained in relation to the effects of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the child@@ birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .

both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in those treated with Hep@@ arin treated groups , women and patients over 65 years were more common in adverse events than male or younger patients .
severe ble@@ eding were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for heavy ble@@ eding such as in table 2 .
both light and severe ble@@ eding occurred in Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone significantly less than in groups with Hep@@ arin plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe ble@@ eding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular ble@@ eding , intra@@ ocular ble@@ eding , hem@@ atology with a diameter ≥ 5 g / d@@ L with known blood flow , ref@@ using to trans@@ fusion , use of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood vessels , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , &quot; other &quot; points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal , ear , nose or neck .
the following information on adverse events are based on data of a clinical study involving bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine in 6000 patients who under@@ go a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in those treated with Hep@@ arin treated groups , women and patients over 65 years were more common in adverse events than male or younger patients .
both light and heavy ble@@ eding occurred in significantly less than in the comparative group under Hep@@ arin plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects that are not listed above were reported in practice after comprehensive application and are combined in Table 6 according to system organs .
in case of over@@ dosage the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is immediately repe@@ ating and the patient eng@@ age in view of a blood of blood .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a direct and specific Th@@ rom@@ bin@@ o@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the catal@@ y@@ tic center as well as at the An@@ ion@@ en@@ bin@@ ge region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in in the liquid phase or to Ger@@ inn@@ sel is bound .
the bin@@ aries of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and with its effect , is reversible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in reli@@ eves the bin@@ aries of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby reducing the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .

in healthy volunteers and patients , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in shows a dos@@ sier and con@@ centric anti @-@ oxid@@ ative effect that is occupied by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if in the patient was carried out a PCI , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in was given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h should be increased .
in arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study was administered in@@ fra@@ c@@ tion@@ ed Hep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arina , according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ mid@@ range ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on four and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ized double blind study with more than 6,000 patients were subjected to one PCI ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , are shown in Table 10 .
clinical studies with a small number of patients delivered limited information on application of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ ical properties of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in were evaluated in patients , subjected to a per@@ cut@@ aneous Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .
it is expected that Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in served as pep@@ tide as pep@@ tide in its amino acid batteries with subsequent recovery of amino acids in the body pool .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children aged six years with diabetes , who need a treatment with ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra will inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous in the ab@@ dom@@ inal wall , inj@@ ected the upper th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm , with a ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient ins@@ ulin on blood glucose levels ( sugar ) or the ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ ism distingu@@ ishes itself very slightly from human ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it acts faster and a shorter active role has as a short @-@ effective human ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a slower ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body cannot produce ins@@ ulin , in two studies with a total of 5@@ 72 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , in which the body was not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator for efficacy was the amendment of the concentration of substance gly@@ cer@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7,@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was found in comparison with a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in ins@@ ulin delivery .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be sensitive to ins@@ ulin @-@ ins@@ ulin , or one of the other constitu@@ ents , or in patients who are already suffering from hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adapted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can work on the blood glu@@ ing .
in September 2004 , the European Commission approved the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ ent@@ is Deutschland GmbH a permit for placing on the market of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the field of ab@@ dom@@ inal ceiling , to apply or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous infusion in the area of ab@@ dom@@ inal bags .
due to the reduced glucose level capacity and di@@ min@@ ished ins@@ ulating metabolism , the ins@@ ulin needs can be decreased in patients with a limitation of liver function .
any change of efficiency , the trademark ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , ins@@ ulin typ@@ s ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ del@@ ays etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the production method can withdraw a change of ins@@ ulin demand .
3 A in@@ adequate dosage or break@@ down of a treatment , especially in patients with a ins@@ ulin @-@ imposed diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and di@@ abet@@ ic k@@ eto@@ ac@@ acid . these states are potentially li@@ fied .
the changeover of a patient to another ins@@ ulin type or a ins@@ ulin in another manufacturer should take place under str@@ ingent supervision and may make a change of dosage .
the time of occurr@@ ence of a hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the action profile of the ins@@ ulin treatment and can therefore change to change the treatment schem@@ atic .
to increase the substances which ampli@@ fy the blood sugar of hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ cem@@ ia , include or@@ ale anti@@ di@@ abet@@ ic , an@@ gi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ or , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ yl@@ line , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ a , Sal@@ iz@@ yl@@ ates and Sul@@ fon@@ amide anti@@ biotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ ol@@ y@@ tics such as Bet@@ ab@@ stain@@ ers , Cl@@ on@@ id@@ in , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in , and Reser@@ pin , the symptoms of ad@@ mi@@ ths are weak@@ ened or missing or missing .
animal experimental studies for re@@ productive tox@@ icity had no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ ic@@ in and Human@@ ins@@ ulin in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known if ins@@ ulin @-@ ulin occurs in the human breast milk but in general ins@@ ulin is not above , nor in mother &apos;s milk , it is res@@ or@@ ated after or@@ ally application .

severe hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ cem@@ ia with consciousness can be given by a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by a physician , or by an intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
after a glucose in a hospital , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine thing for the heavy hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
ins@@ ulin reduces the blood sugar level by stim@@ ulating glucose recovery ( especially by sk@@ el@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing the glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of ins@@ ulin de@@ formation faster and the activity of activity shorter than at hu@@ g man@@ em normal ins@@ ulin .
in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes t@@ amp@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in the therapeu@@ tically relevant met@@ ering range from 0,0@@ 75 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional increase in the glu@@ ing effect , just like human ulin .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast active ingredients like normal human@@ istic ulin and achieved the complete glu@@ ing effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human ulin .
the data was evident that in a application of ins@@ ulin delivery in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ ural gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved as with human normal ins@@ ulin , which is 30 minutes before the meal .
ins@@ ulin @-@ ulin was done in 2 minutes before meal , a better post @-@ depth control than with human normal ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if ins@@ ulin is turned in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control , such as human normal ins@@ ulin , which is given 2 ten@@ ds before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
ins@@ ulin delivery in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - before the beginning of the meal was given ( figure 1A ) and compared to human normal ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
ins@@ ulin delivery in gift of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - after the start of the meal ) , after the beginning of the meal , was given in 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1C ) .
