<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European public conference report (EPAR) in which explains how the Committee for Humanities (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out in order to get recommendations concerning the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the packs (also part of the EPAR) or turn to your doctor or pharmacists.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish further information regarding the recommendations of the CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets, which dissolve in mouth) as a solution to remove (1 mg / ml) and as injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirres thinking and talking, hallucinations (hearing or vision of things that are not present), mistrust and madness, a psychic illness (periods become abnormal) alternately with periods of normal atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat aggravated episodes and prevention of manic episodes of patients who have applied to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders, if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used to remove or used the melting tablets in patients where the hatching of tablets is prepared.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who simultaneously accept other medicines, which are to be dismantled equally as Abilify should be adapted to the dose of Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">The signal transmission between brain cells due to "neurotransmitter", i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ariiprahydrate is probably especially as "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptophamine (also called Serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Ariipraole like 5-hydroxytryptophamine and dopamine, but with lower dimensions as the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptophamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder which helps to normalize the activity of brain, which means psychotic or manic symptoms and their reoccur.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify, to prevent the symptoms of symptoms, was investigated in three studies by up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, compared to a placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilize and placebo which had been reactive to 160 patients where the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with gilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injector solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder which suffered on increased unrest, with the Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the changes in symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scala disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led trials to investigate how the body uses the melting tablets and the solution to remove (up).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injection solution showed patients who received Abilize in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of unrest than those who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application of treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify fell into four of the five short-term studies of chronic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented for up to 74 weeks of more effective than placebo in previously treated patients and when an existing treatment was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Put-out injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms driven unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common adverse events of Abilify (observing at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (sovereignty), secularisation (sovereignty), seclusion (sovereignty), spinal hypersecretion (increased memory output), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnie (sleep disturb) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from medium to severe serious episodes of patients who had predominantly manic episodes on the treatment of Ariipraole, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee became the result that the advantages of injection solution in the rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes of Bipolar-I disturbance, if an oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for placing on the placing of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of constant to severe episodes of the Bipolar-I- disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients, mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment of Ariiprazol languages (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness of doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although individual patients can benefit from higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY amounts to 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar-I- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proved.</seg>
<seg id="33">With respect to the larger sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose may be considered, if clinical factors are justify (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 induction brake is removed from combination therapy, the Ariipylbenzene dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after change of antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Ariipraole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased Suicide risk with Ariipraole compared to other antipsychotica.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ariipraole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease, pathogenic disease, conditions that are used for hypotony disease (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blaminated medicines) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spatidyskinesia: in clinical trials that were a year or less digested, there were occasional reports about during treatment with Ariiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If used in an ABILIFY patients treated patients and symptoms of a late dyskinesis, should be taken into consideration to reduce the dose or treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient developed signs and symptoms developed on a mns, or unclear fever without any additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotica must be removed including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Ariipraole should be used in patients with crampfanfare in the Anamnese or in terms of states that are applied to caution with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old with Ariipraole in patients with psychosis were associated with psychosis who were treated with Alzheimer's disease, an increased death of death in comparison to the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosing and the response to unwanted cerebrovascular events in treated with Ariiprabenzene treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with Ketoacti or hyperosmolarem Koma or death, was reported in patients with atypical antipsychotic ingredients, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related events at ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic ingredients that allow direct failure.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polymers, polyphagie and weakness) are observed in patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus in relation to deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally known for narrated patients and in patients with bipolar manie due to Comorbidding, the application of antipsychotika, where weight gain is observed, or an unhealthy lifestyle, and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Ariipraole on the central nervous system is careful when Ariipraole in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines is taken with overlable side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-Antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Ariiprazol, although this effect is not relevant to clinically.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a high-effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Ariiprazole by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects have, and therefore, similar dose can be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolism can result in the common use with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ariiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolic.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY into consideration, the potential benefits should survive for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore should be similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">According to the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage should be increased from ABILIFY to the dose height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diluazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered jointly with ABILIFY, can be reckoned with a constant increase in the arithmetic concentration.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials showed doses of 10-30 mg of Ariane raole a day no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">People should be given to receiving their doctor if they are pregnant or use a pregnancy during treatment with Ariipraole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data situation for the security in humans and in the reproductive studies in the animal, this medicine may not be applied in the pregnancy, unless possible use justifies the potential risk for the mowers.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, like other antipsychotica, the patients should be warned of dangerous machines, including power vehicles, including power vehicles, until they are sure that Ariipraole has no negative effect.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the adverse events listed below is defined in accordance with the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Ariipraole, a total amount of incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, acidity and dyskinesia, compared with patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Ariane raole treatment and 13,1% in patients were placebo under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients who were treated with Ariiprazole and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes on Bipolar-I disorder - in a controlled study over 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients suffering from Ariiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study above 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients with Ariipylbenzene treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>

<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups below Ariiprazol and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, there was no medically important differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases the CPK (creatine phosphoase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Ariipylbenzene treated patients compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To adverse events that can occur in connection with antipsychotic therapy, the maligne neuroleptosis, Spätdyskinesia and Krampfancases, among undesirable illness, and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical studies and since the market launch, unintended or deliberate overlactings were observed with Ariipraole alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there are no information on the efficacy of a hemalysis in the treatment of an overdosage with Ariipraole; it is unlikely that hemalysis in the treatment of an overdosage of benefits, as Ariipraole has a high plasma integration.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Ariipraole in schizophrenia and Bipolar-I disturbance on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on Serotonin 5HT2a receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Ariipraole in vitro showed a high affinity to Dopamine D2- and D3 receptor, as well as a moderate affinity to Dopamine D4-, to Serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7- to alpha-1-adore and for histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Ariipraole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers showed a dossient reduction in the binge of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor-Liganden, at Nucleus caudatus and on turkey.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1.228 patients with positive or negative symptoms, Ariipraole showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperidol-controlled study was 52 out of the proportion of response of the patients who had a response to study medicine in both groups (Ariipraole 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values are defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- Depression rates, showed a significantly stronger than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in response rate, which was 34% in the Ariiprazole group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study was involved in schizophrenia of over 26 weeks, 314 patients were significantly reduced compared with an average weight gain of at least 7% compared to the output value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of approx. 5.6 kg).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapist studies with more flexible dosing for 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disturbance, Ariipraole showed an improvement over placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapist study of 3 weeks with fixed dosing of patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disturbance, Ariiprazol showed no superior efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two Placemento- and active-controlled monotherapist studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Ariipraole showed an opposite placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a gain effect that was comparable to lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition to Ariiprazole, 12 a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the manie at like lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar-I disturbance, with or without psychotic characteristics, the accompanying treatment with Ariipraole showed a superior efficacy in the reduction of manic symptoms compared to the monotherapies with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study of over 26 weeks, followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks, with Ariipraole during a stabilisation phase, Ariiprazol showed a remission in contrast to placebo in relation to the prevention of a bipolar response, predominantly in the prevention of a return in the manie.</seg>

<seg id="90">In Ariipraole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as in pharmacokinetical investigation, patients showed no sexually-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics did not notice a reference to clinically significant differences concerning ethnic origin or the impact of the room on pharmacokinetics of Ariipraole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetical properties of Ariipraole and dehydration o-Ariane raole were similar in patients with heavier renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study on subjects with various grave liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugal A, B and C) showed no significant effect on pharmacokinetics of Ariipraole and dehydration, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis in class C, which is not enough to move to the metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies for safety harmacology, toxicity in repetitive gift, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the pathogenic potential, the premative data let not recognize any special hazards for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological effects were observed only with doses or expositions that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they only have limited or no significance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects enveloped a dosisdependent side-toxicity (Lipofuscin of pigments and / or parenchycot) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 10 times the medium-sized Steady State exposition (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of people).</seg>

<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Zoledronacid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced Clearance of by Cytochrome P450 enzymes is unlikely because Zoledronic acid is not yet metabolized by humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, variably dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Zoledronic acid correlated with the creatine Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatine Clearance, and was found in the 64 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">It arises that a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a non-kidney cleanse until a creatine clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require dosing adaptable to Zoledronic acid.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR to the public The present document is a summary of the European public conference report (EPAR) in which explains how the Committee for Humanities (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out in order to get recommendations concerning the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin dependent diabetes), where metformin (a diabetic medicine) is not shown. • It can be used together with another diabetic medicine (Dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (especially superior patients) it can not be satisfied with metformin alone in the highest possible dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphite compound or insulin, the old dose of Sulfonylharnstoffs or insulin can be retained, except for patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced by the dose of the sulphite ricane and insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body-owned insulin can be used better and the blood sugar level, which means that type 2 diabetes is better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">With more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of actos in tripletherapy was investigated; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfa harnant, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in blood (glycerylized hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a decrease in the HbA1c value which allows the blood sugar levels in use of doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional treatment of actos to the existing treatment with metformin and sulphite sulphide in a reduction of HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of actos and insulin had been studied in 289 patients, patients who participated in addition to insulin, a reduction in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients who participated in the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were visual disturbances, infections of the upper respiratory symptoms (pathways), weight gain and hypoanaesthesia (reduced sensitivity to irritation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients either in patients who may react sensitively (allergic) to Pioglitazone or one of the other parts, still in patients with liver problems, cardiac insufficiency or diabetic Ketoacacid (high level view - acidity level - acidity level).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos in the frame of a monotherapist (when used when used) as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients, metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for placing on the placing of actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, curved and wear on one side the marking "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is insufficient in which metformin due to contraindications or incompatibility (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age are not available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. past heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should begin with the lowest recommended dose, and increase the dose continuously.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain or oils, especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain and odeme when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced illness was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports about herinsufficiency, but did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver cells (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard section) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range are the liver enzyme values as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient has developed symptoms that refer to an astical dysfunction, such as explosive nausea, vomiting, upper conomnia, fatigue, appetite and / or darker Harn, are the liver enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazone should be continued until the procedure was conducted by clinical evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, dosisdependent weight gain was demonstrated that can be taken by fat deposits and in some cases with a liquid force.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a Häoglitazone therapy after therapy with Pioglitazone, a minor reduction in the middle hemoglobbance (relative reduction by 4%) and hematology (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with Pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoyster bins by 3-4%) and to a lower degree in patients under Sulfonteat and insulin (relative reduction of hemognibins by 1-2%) and hematology (reduced by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the elevated insinsensitivity in patients, the Pioglitazone has been used as orale dual-paced or triple-combination therapy with insulin, the risk of a dossier, hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Following the market launch of Thiazolidindian, including pioglitazone, including pioglitazone, was reported on an occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic macular edems with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the consumption of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular oily, but admittent doctors should be aware of the possibility of a macular defect when patients report on visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmologic examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of messages unwanted events in randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients who were treated with Pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated tincture was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with Pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with Pioglitazone treated patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy, and if a patient need a pregnancy or this one, the treatment is to apply (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on investigation of the interactions have shown that Pioglitazone does not have relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs, metabolized by these enzymes metabolitiva, Cyclosporin, Calciumcanalblocker and HMGCoA-Reductor products are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase of AUC of Pioglitazone in order to increase the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction of AUC of Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is attributable to pioglitazone treatment of hyperinsulinum neuranemia and increased insulin-resistant of the parent, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates to the fogale growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very frequent &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 10000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (not available from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">This lead to a temporary change of the tower and the refractive index of the lens, as they are also observed in other hypoglyricating agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, ALT ascents to the three times the upper limit of the standard range is equal to as under Placebo, but more rarely than in comparative groups under metformin or Sulfontea..</seg>
<seg id="793">In a outcome study of patients with pre-existing advanced microvascular disease, the frequency of a serious heart failure was 1.6% higher than in placebo when pioglitazone bzan.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, rarely exceeds herbinsufficiency using Pioglitazone, more frequently, when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">It was a summarizing analysis of unwanted events in randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone treated groups and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative medication treated groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the trial period of 3.5 years the proactive study, fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone treated patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, 180 mg / day amounted to 180 mg / day over seven days.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to have a activation of specific core recipe (Peroxisome) proliferator of Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)), which leads to an elevated insensitivity of liver, fat and skeleton muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose levels in case of insulin-resistant.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Gliclazid as a monotherapist has been continued over two years to investigate the period until posting the therapeutic efficacy (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 therapy courses).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy, blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was defined by Pioglitazone at 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was discontinued despite three-month optimization phase, to Pioglitazone or placebo were randomized.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45%, compared to the patients who continue to receive only insulin; a reduction of insulin-in-treated group was observed with Pioglitazone group.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies over one year, under Pioglitazone, a statistically significant decline of the Albumine / Kreatinin-Quotiations demonstrated in comparison to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapists with 45 mg versus placebo) was examined in a small, for 18 weeks study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">Most clinical studies were observed compared to placebo a reduction in the plasma triglyceride and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol levels and marginally, but clinically unsignificantly increased LDL- cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone was reduced compared to placebo, metformin or liclicoszid the total plasmatricular glycemia and the free fatty acids and elevated the HDL Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo was found no statistically significant increase in LDL Cholesterinspiegel, while metformin and licenzid diminished values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazone was not only the sober triglyceride, but also improved the postprandial which increased triglyceride mirror, both for a effect on the triglyceride absorption and also on the heap of the triglycerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced disease were randomised to either Pioglitazone or placebo for a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">According to oral application, Pioglitazone is quickly resorated, with the concreations of unchangeable pioglitazone in plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV corresponds to efficacy in roughly the three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazone could not have relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to oral application of radioactive Pioglitazone in humans, the marker was mainly found in the Fishing (55%) and a lower degree in Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-Eliminationshal period of unchangeable Pioglitazone is 5-6 hours, and the total of the active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma concentration of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower than in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy subjects, but resembling the rates of oral Clearance of the maternity.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, after repeated administration of plasma volumes, anaemia and diversified eccentric heart hypertrophie.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is attributable to Pioglitazone treatment of hyperinsulinum neuranemia and increased insulin-resistant of the parent, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates to the fogale growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), hyperplasia of hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumours (male rats) of the urinary epithelium was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of family-familial polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other Thiazolidindiones resulted in an increased frequency of colontum.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and wear on one side the marking "30" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated tincture was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with Pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with Pioglitazone treated patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study about two years the effects of a combination of metformin were examined with Pioglitazone or Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies over 1 year, under Pioglitazone, statistically significant decline of the Albumine / Kreatinin-Quotiations demonstrated in comparison to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazone was not only the sober triglyceride, but also improved the postprandial which increased triglyceride mirror, both across a effect on the tryglycemic absorption as well as on the headers of Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing the target of its primary endpoint, a combination of the overall mortal infections, stroke Koronarusiarisation and Revascularisation of the leg arteries, found the results close that with the intake of pioglitazone no cardiovascular risk are associated with the intake of Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and wear on one side the marking "45" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summarizing analysis of unwanted events in randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients who received were treated with Pioglitazone and showed a higher incidence of bones in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with Pioglitazone treated patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="832">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazone was not only the sober triglyceride, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride mirror, both for a effect on the triglyceride absorption as well as to the heap of the triglycerid synthesis.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was produced in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the pancreas can produce no insulin, and type 2 diabetes, where the body is not able to use the insulin in effective.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, the concentration of a substance (glycerylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured, which shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane resulted in a decrease in the HbA1c mirror which indicates that the blood sugar levels were similar, similar to other human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who may not react sensitively (allergic) to humaninsulin (rDNA) or one of the other parts.</seg>
<seg id="868">Moreover, the cans of Actraphane may be adjusted, if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can be effected on blood sugar (the complete list is to be paid for the complete list).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Actraphane was survived in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted Novo Nordisk A / S for placing the placing on the placing of Actraphane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products normally applied once or twice daily, if a fast initials effect together with a longer lasting effect will be desired.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle has to be loaded for at least 6 seconds under the skin to ensure that the entire dose is injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar is considerably improved by an intense insulin therapy, the hypoglycemia warning symptom can be perceived and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any modification with regards strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast effective, flexible, long-acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (insulin insulin, human insulin, insulin insulin, and / or production method (due to recombinant DNA against insulin origin) may lead that a variation of the dosage is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="875">If the change to Actraphane on the patient is required, this may be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the changeover.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients where hypoglycemic reactions were reported after a change from animal insulin in human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or differently compared with their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">In front of travelling, which should go over several time zones, the patient should bring on it to retrieve the Council of his physician, as such travels, insulin and meals must be applied and taken to other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in therapy and must always ask for other medicines that were included in the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="879">4. hypoglycaemia as well as hyperglycemia, which may occur in an insufficient diabetic therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit tod in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemia can lead to consciousness and / or crampfanfare, with temporary or permanent disruptions of brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Disorders of the nervous system - peripheral neuropathy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are classified as acute painful neuropathy and usually reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5 A intensification of insulin therapy with a rupted improvement of blood sugar setting can however be connected with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="883">Illnesses of the skin and the subhaust woven - Lipodystrophy on the injection point can emerge, if they failed to change the injection area within the injection area.</seg>
<seg id="884">General disorders and complaints regarding the administration site Gelegulation - Local oversensitive reaction to injection point During insulin therapy can occur local oversensitive interactions (Roman, swelling, Juckreiz, pain and hematoma at the injection point).</seg>

<seg id="886">However, a hypoglycaemia can develop continuously: • Easily hypoglycemia can be treated through the orale supply of glucose or sugar foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have gravitality, sweets, biscuits, or sugar fruit juice with a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven help or by glucose which is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the maximum maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total capacity of the activity is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The Resorption Profile is based in this product to ensure a blend of insulin products with fast or delayed Resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A series of management (hydrolysis) places on human insulin molecule were moved into consideration; none of the metabolism of the metabolites is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional studies for safety harmacology, toxicity in repetitive gift, genotoxicity, to carcinogenic potential and to reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data does not recognize any special hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after the Actraphane waterbottle from the fridge was taken - the temperature of insulin at room temperature (not above 25 ° C) before it is used for the first use.</seg>
<seg id="893">Some patients where hypoglycemic reactions were reported after a change from animal insulin in human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or differently compared with their previous insulin.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunity-intensive therapy and treatment of transplant patients, should arrange this medicine or change in immunity-intensive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of systemic exposure of tacrolimus this can lead to transplants or to an increased incidence of adverse events, including sub-or immune diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always retain the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; Modification of the regime or regime should be made only under the engmaschal control of an experienced medical device (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a changeover to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus will remain.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be primarily based on clinical assessment of abortions and tolerability in detail and on blood-level regulations (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After conversion from Prograf on Advagraf, the tacrolimus valley level should be controlled before conversion and controlled over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, the systemic exposure measured as valley level, with both forceors both with kidney stones and with lebertransplantated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the tacrolimus valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advocf to ensure adequate substance exposure in direct transplants phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Because Tacrolimus is a substance with low clearing, may take a adaptation of the Advagraf-Dosisschemas several days until the Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1422">Additional dose adjustments may be needed later, as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change in the process of stabilization of patients after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of the corneal Advanty therapy should begin with 0,10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dose recommended - changeover from prograf on Advagram must be converted to once daily intake of prograf capsules to once daily intake of Advagraf. this conversion has to take place in a ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg), relative to the whole daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="1428">Dose adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood mirror in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function The kidney function does not have influence on pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, which may be assumed that a dose is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potentials of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of kidney function (including a regular determination of serum creatinance levels) is recommended for calculating the creatinine and monitoring of the urinary volume).</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from Ciclosporin on Advagraf In the transition from a Ciclosporin- to a tacrolimus-based therapy is caution command (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations to the dam in full blood die the dose should be associated with clinical assessment of abortion and tolerability in a single-blood-tacrolimus valley level controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the tacrolimus valley level during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-tales of tacrolimus should also be checked after conversion of prograf on Advagraf, Dosiscustomization, modifications of immunity-intensive therapy or in the same application of substances which could change the tacrolimus whole blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagram is a medicine with a low clearing, adaptations of the dose may require several days until the Steady State has occured.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies make sure that a successful treatment is possible in most cases if the valley level should not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice the valley level of tacrolimus is usually seen in the first time after liver transplants usually within the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with kidneys and cortransplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance of liver, kidney and cardiac transplants were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This resulted in serious adverse events, including transplants or other side effects, which may occur in a consequence of tacrolimus under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always retain the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; Modification of the regime or regime should be made only under the engmaschal control of an experienced medical device (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplant transplants, proved to be proven to other immunotherapy than therapies, there are still no clinical data for the retaining formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">To prophylaxis of the transplants of adult transplants in adult heart transplants or transplants in childhood are still no clinical data for the retaining formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus level in blood and a weakening of the clinical efficacy of Tacrolimus, the gestion of medications which contain currant (hypericum perforated), or other plant healing during treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">Patients with diarrhoea is a particularly careful monitoring of the tacrolimming concentrations in the blood, as the tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to severe fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under prograf was described as a cardiomyopathy chamber or seumhypertrophy, which can also occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical interference, a treatment with cortieroids, hypertension, kidney or liver function, infections, fluid loading and oil.</seg>
<seg id="1447">Like with other immunity pants the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of malignant skin changes caused by suitable clothing or use of a solar protection with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who explored Tacrolimus, symptoms for preaches like headaches, impaired awareness of consciousness, forces and tendencies should indicate a radiological examination (e.g. for example).</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since Advagraf's hard capsules, retardiert, lactose is contained in patients with the rare hereditary gactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-Galactose-Malabsorption special attention.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous application of medicines or herbal medicinal agents that are known as inhibitor or inductors from CYP3A4 can influence the metabolism of tacrolimus and therefore reduce the blood values of tacrolimus or lower.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Therefore it is recommended to change the tacrolimus - blood mirror with the same gift of substances which can change the CYP3A metabolism, and to set the tacrolimus dose to maintaining even equal concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase of blood levels mainly resulting from the elevated bioavailability of tacrolimus, due to the inhibiting of the gastrointestinal failure.</seg>
<seg id="1454">High-dose prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as it is used for acute remotions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous application of tacrolimus is metabolized by CYP3A4 metabolizes their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus reduces the clearing of steroid contraceptible, so that the hormonal exposition can increase particularly careful when decisions on empirical action.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experimentation have shown that Tacrolimus potentially reduce the Clearance of pentobarbital and phenazon and extend their half-time period.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of investigations to transplant patients deliver no evidence that under Tacrolimus compared to other immunvibris an increased risk of undesirable events in terms of course and the result of pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1467">It was reported on malignant or malignant Neoplasms including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative disorders and skin tumors associated with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma cutting can be assumed that Tacrolimus is not dialytic.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The effects of active mechanism and concodynamic effects on molecular level should be conveyed by the effects of tacrolimus by its binding to an cytosolic protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for the enrichment of the connection in cell phones.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advices is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a deficiency of a deficiency of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosing and frequency of the application admits after that Advance is applied for the treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII lack which causes blood clauses such as bleeding in joints, muscle or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but referred to a method designed as "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell that was brought into a gene (DNA), which is capable of establishing the human body-factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advata is similar to other medicines approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but is unlike any other, so that the medicine contains no proteins and animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies on patients with severe up to moderate haemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the application of the drug was examined with surgical procedures as well as surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"" "in the main study the efficacy of Advices has been awarded with" "" "excellent" "" "or with" "" "well" "" "with" "" "well" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of Advices (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, Pyotrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate should not be used in patients who may be sensitive to human intra factor VIII, mouse or hamsterprotein or one of the other parts.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission approved the Company Baxter AG a permit for placing the placing of Advices in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of substitution therapy are calculated according to the severity of factor VIII deficiency, after the place and the extent of blood and clinical development of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">For the following dirhagic events, a factor of VIII activity shall not fall under the specified plasma concentration (in% of the standard or in i.e. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection all 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat until the pain and the acute notation have been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection all 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk is passed over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During treatment course, the frequency is administered to the controller and the frequency of injections a reasonable determination of factor VIII plasma labels.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different semiconductor times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII per kg body weight at a gap of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected Factor VIII plasma activities are not achieved or if the blood is not ruled with a reasonable dose, a test must be carried out to follow the inhibitor for the inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that the Factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic interactions must be affected.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The administration rate is to be addressed according to the patient's assessment, whereby the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk is dependent on the largest and other factors within the first 20 expositions.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and an unknown inhibitor development, after conversion from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, reoccur (low titre) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and nursing time.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs's greatest number of patients were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients) that have an higher risk to formation of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and swingarm (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000), very rare (1 / 10,000), very rare (frequency on the basis of available data not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected drop of blood coagulation factor VIII-mirrors occurred postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperatively day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">During the entire time, the blood clots was maintained and both the factor VIII- mirror in plasma as well as the Clearance rate showed adequate values on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostic heavier and moderate haemophilia A (≥ 150 days), only one patient showed a low inhibitors (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach).</seg>

<seg id="1562">Previously untreated clinical study showed 5 out of 25 (20%) patients with ADVATE treated patients inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of patients on traces of contamination of contaminant proteins was analyzed by the investigation of the antibody titres against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported adverse reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend than also a persistent peak of anti-Cho cells, otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that indicate an allergic reaction or a sensitivity.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the first approval of the data available, the CHMP has further evaluated the benefits of risk-risk, but in fact that safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has on the basis of the safety filter from ADVATE, which requires a submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited was officially distributed to the Committee for Humanities (CHMP) that the company takes its application for placing the placing of Advocin to the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the chest, the brain, the bones or soft parts (tissues, the other structures in the body binds and is based) thereof.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a way of virus that genetically modified so that it can bear a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is an "Adenovirus," which is so modified that there is no copies of themselves, and therefore no infections can solve in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advocin would have been injected directly into the tumors and thus permit the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53-protein, which is made out of non-defectives in the human body of the p53 gene, is usually used for the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can not be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, where the p53 gene is not correct, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells may further grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company placed data from a study with a study involving the Li-Fraumeni-Krebs in the field of building, into bone and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP has examined the answers from the company to the asked questions, some issues were unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the purchase of the initially submitted documents, the CHMP grants a list of questions which will be sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion, the injection of Advocin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore has been advantages to the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee further concerns relating to the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the security of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently proved that I can be made in a reliable way, that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in-in contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company put the CHMP not in knowledge, whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently has to participate in clinical studies or "Compassionate Use Use programs with Advexin.</seg>

<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used for treating symptoms of seasonal rhinitis (hay bops, by an allergy against pollen) in patients with nasal mual swelling (inflated nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents ages 12 and older, the recommended dose of Aerinaze twice daily, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated, as soon as the symptoms, above all the swelling of the nasal mucosa (stopped nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be found on the blockage of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effective measures were the changes in the severity of the Heuvein-nymptome that were reported by the patient prior to the treatment and during 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, the patients had their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all the hops-nymptome, the patients reported that the Aerinaze had fallen by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in patients who had pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients under aerinaze showed a reduction of symptoms by 37.4% versus 26.7% in patients who were Desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (encountered at 1 to 10 of 100 patients), anorexie (heart rate), pharyngitis (throweries), illitis, headache, fatigue, insomnie (sleepiness), insomnia and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be sensitive to patients who may be sensitive to desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or one of the other constituents, against adenerable active ingredients or Loratadine (another medicine for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze can also be used in patients who suffer from a bottomangle glaucoma (hypertension), hyperthyreosis (hypertension), hyperthyreosis (hypertension), hyperthyreosis (hypertension) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit for placing on the distribution of aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is in the whole (i.e. without crush it, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be applied due to the lack of data for the insolvency and efficacy (see section 5.1) not for children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, since long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrine can take time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After reducing the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respirators, the treatment can be continued with desloratadine as a monotherapist.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As aerinaze pseudoephedrine contains, the medicine is also treated with patients who are treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoohedrine with other vasoconstriamine, Pergoid, Lisotamine, Dihydroergotamine or other Dekongestiva, phenylephramine, phenyleek, ephedrine, oxalolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient's collection, and the data are not sufficient to discuss appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and effectiveness of Aerinaze were not tested in patients with renal or liver function and are not sufficient to discuss appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">The patients must be informed that the treatment during the occurrence of hypertension or a speedometer, or of palpitations, heart rhythmids, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a amplification of headaches) must be set.</seg>

<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is made at least 48 hours prior to performing dermatological tests to reduce antihistamine otherwise positive reactions to indicators for skin reaction and reduce their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In addition to clinical trials with Desloratadine, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered, however, no clinically important interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychedelic testing was no significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadine and treated with placebo-treated patients, regardless of whether Desloratadine alone or with alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the Metabolism of Desloratadadin was not yet identified, so interactions with other medicines can not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadine inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibits and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The insolvency of the application of aerinaze during pregnancy is not secured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies in animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconical properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be applied in the pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be clarified that in very rare cases the patients can be found in very rare cases, which may cause impairment of traffic and ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a ZNS-depression (sedation, apnoe, reduces mental attention, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular disease) and a ZNS stimulation (insomnia, Hallucinations, Tremor, Conflicsions) with possible letting.</seg>

<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibiting of proinflammatory cytokinen such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophile as well as the inhibiting of the expression of the eagle-selectivity to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring ranges of flight performance including the amplification of subjective battles or tasks that are connected to the flies.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, the recommended dose of 5 mg daily has no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathomimetic effects, such as an increase of blood pressure, a speedometer or manifestations of a ZNS.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients were enrolled in the age between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, whereby 414 patients received aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine efficacy of aerinaze tablets was determined using the overall weight for symptoms (except for nasal muzzle), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2 weeks treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">Effectiveness of aerinaze tablets with respect to the swelling effect, determined using the nasal muzzle, was significantly higher than under a monotherapyadine over the 2 weeks treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the context of a single dose study for pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, desloratadine is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze with healthy volunteers over 14 days the flow-weight of desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrine was reached in day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within a pharmacokinetetic multi-technical study, which was carried out with the formulation as tablet to healthy adult subjects, was found that four subjects disinloratadine poorly worned.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component-interaction study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrin is equivalent to the exposure of pseudoephedrin bioequivalent to exposure to an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies for safety harmacology, toxicity, toxicity, toxicity and reproductive toxicity, the predefined clinical data with Desloratadine did not recognize any special hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than their individual components, and the observed effects were generally in the context of the pseudoephedrine content.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies the combination of Loratadine / pseudoephedrine was not liable in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in eight studies with an allergy rhinitis in eight studies with allergy rhinitis (including four trials for seasonal rhinitis and two studies on patients who also had Asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The efficacy was measured by the change of symptoms (itchy, number and size of squares, impairment of sleep and performance on days) before and after six weeks treatment was determined.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution to remove and the melting tablets in the same manner as tablets and application in children are unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">When allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius were observed an average decrease of symptoms (symptoms of symptoms) by 25 to 26% compared to the patient who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urtiaria the decline of symptoms after six weeks treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared to placebo treated with placebo treated.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be sensitive to desloratadine, Loratadine or one of the other parts.</seg>

<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharynological study, Aerius and alcohol was not reinforced (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, the patients should be clarified that in very rare cases the patients can be found in very rare cases, that may lead to impairment of the traffic or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">For clinical studies in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic uria, 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius were reported when patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events that were reported more frequently than placebo was tiredness (1,2%), mouthness (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 young people from 12 to 17 years the most common headache was treated with 5.9% of patients who were treated with Desloratadine and in 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be divided into dependence on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">An intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week, and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown by the total of the questionnaire to life quality at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively weakened the pollution caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urtikaria became deputy for further forms of the urtiaria, as the underlying Pathophysiology is similar to eology in different forms and chronic patients can be recruited easier.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As the histamine burial factor is expected in all urticularial diseases, that Desloratadine is expected to improve symptoms of urtikaria as well as in other forms of the urticularia; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urisaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose intervals.</seg>

<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that could cause before a trunk of influenza, who could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">An influenza pandemic breaks even if a new tribe of influenza, who can easily spread human beings, because human beings still have no immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system acknowledges the vaccine contained in the vaccine as "body-foreign" and forms antibodies to it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">In this way, the immune system will be able to form an antiquantibacterial antibody in contact with an influenza.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Afterwards, the membranes of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on membrane surface, which detects the human body as body-foreign), is cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="1911">Agenase was examined in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who were previously treated with protease.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug Agenase with low dosiavir reinforced drug Agenase was compared with 206 adults who compared with other types of protein.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Primary indebator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-proven concentrations of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change of virusload after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In studies with patients who had previously taken no protests but had a viral load below 400 copies / ml under placebo for 48 weeks, but Agenase was less effective as indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenase also decreased the virusload, whereby however, of the children who had been previously treated with protease, only very few on the treatment languages.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had been treated earlier with protrusters were treated with Ritonavir reinforced drugs Agenase the virusload after 16 weeks treatment just as effective as other protease inhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protein-inhibitor, it came under Agenase together with Ritonavir into a stronger waste of viral load after four weeks as in the patient who continued its previous protests:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common adverse events of Agenase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenase may not be used in patients who may be sensitive to ambamr or one of the other parts.</seg>

<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of afase in combination with low doses of Ritonvir or other protests were not examined at children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years due to lack of data for the insolvency and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetetic data, the dose to Agenase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disturbances to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be treated with severe or regular liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver function, it is contra-indexed (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low-therapeutic width and also substrate the substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations that contain currant (hypericum perforated), may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a diminished therapeutic effect of amortavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should not be noted that Agenase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and may continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including the treatment of Agenase, does not prevent the risk of a transmission of HIV upon others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">For usually, Agenase capsules shall be applied along with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of the drug was investigated, however, its effectiveness was measured (by decreasing the reduction of GAG concentration in urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years Aldurazyme was diagnosed in the urine in the urine of about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal sized liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common adverse events of Alduracme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain (joint pain), arthralies, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion station.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), speedometer (accelerated heart rate), fever and shook frost.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be sensitive to patients who may not react strongly (allergic) to laronidase or one of the other parts (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>

<seg id="2283">The producers of Aldurazyme will receive patients who observe alazole, as regards reactions to infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the company Genzyme Europe B.V. An authorization for placing the placing of Aldurazyme in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of the human α-l-Iduronidase and is produced using a combinant DNA technology under the use of Cho-Mammalogier cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ose, Eierstock of the Chinese hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is used to treat patients with secured diagnosis of a Muenysaccharides (MPS I, α -l-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with algae azole should be done by a physician, the experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient is able to increase all 15 minutes in single steps at a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of algae azyme in adults over 65 years was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurations in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">With algae-related patients, patients may develop infusions-related reactions, which are defined as any related conceptivity that occurs during the infusion, or until the end of the infusion of the infusion (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should continue to monitor engmaschig, and the infusion of alypazole should be carried out only in an appropriate clinical environment, in the revival equipment for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the Phase 3 clinical trial, nearly all patients IgG antibodies are formed against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the course of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infuzzy reaction must be treated with caution by Aldurazyme with caution (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer interruption, must be careful due to the theoretical increased risk reaction after a interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medications (antihistamine and / or antipyka) to minimize the potential occurrence of infuzzy reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of light or medium-induced response-related reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / Ibuprofen should be and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to the half of the infusion rate when the response has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infueled reaction, the infusion must be stopped, until the symptoms are accounted for, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / Ibuprofen is considering.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion is made with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the response has occurred to be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / Ibuprofen and / or Corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the past reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain because a potential risk of interference with intraocular intake of laronidase exists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful impact on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data in newborns, who were exposed to Laronic Pumps on maternal milk, is recommended to wear during treatment with algae azole.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The adverse events in clinical studies were classified mainly as infusions-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants of less than 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Undesired pharmaceutical reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during the phase 3-year period or older at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years, are often listed in the following table: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with heavier MPS-I-related participation of the upper respiratory work and lungs in pre-history, severe reactions appeared also, including bronchospels, breathing-breathing and visual acuity (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug interactions in connection with algae azole, which were reported during a phase 2 study involving 20 patients aged under 5, with predominantly severe acute form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, within 3 months after treatment, it was one of the patient's treatment, with a heavier-run shape, usually within a period of 5 years (average after 26 days over 45 days at age ranged from 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to a premature retirement from the study) were not detective inhibiting (RIP) Assay detectable antibodies, among them 3 patients who never came to Serconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lacking up to low antibody levels indicated a robust lowering of GAG mirror in Harn, while patients with high antibody titres was a variable reduction of GAG in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing its activity in vitro, which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear in connection with the incidence of undesired pharmaceutical reactions, even if the occurrence of undesired pharmaceutical reactions were typically taken together with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The grounds for the enzyme of enzymes is in one of the hydrolysis of the cumulative substrate and the prevention of a further accumulation sufficient restoration of the enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">According to intravenous infusion, Laronidase will quickly removed from circulation and cells into the lysosomes, most likely over Mannsosomes, most likely over Mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of aldurations were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of the patients had been recruited from the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute walking distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were recruited for an open-label extension study, where it received another 3,5 years (182 weeks) each week 100 E / kg of algae.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurst's treated patients from the placebo group to improve the lung function and the ability to determine which is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in deredurme / Aldurazyme group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the expected percentage of FEV is not significantly higher than this period clinically and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased further proportionally to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with an hepatoma of the treatment reached 22 (85%) up to the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear reduction of the GAG mirror in Harn (µg / mg of creatine) was detected, which remained constant at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patient which was taken into account, clinically significant changes for five efficacy (58%), movement of motion (22%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration of 9 patients (20%) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2327">One-year-old open phase 2 study was conducted, mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of algae were examined at 20 patients, which were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years (16 patients with severe declining form and 4 with the mean follow-up).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to an increased GAG- mirror in Harn during the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients, a size growth (n = 7) and weight gain (n = 3) was determined according to the Z-Score for these age group The younger patients with severe declining form only limited or even no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, examinations for the dynamic effects of various aluminazyme dosage schemata were carried out on GAG mirror in Harn, the liver volume, and the 6-minute test test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can present in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions, an represented alternative; however, it is not noted that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>

<seg id="2355">Alimta is not treated with patients who had previously untreated, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who previously used other chemotherapies, used as sole therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce adverse events, the patient should receive a corticosteroid and folic acid (vitamin B12) and folic acid (vitamin B12).</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered along with cisplatin, or after the administration of cisplatin additionally an "antiemetic" (medicines for vomiting) and liquids (to prevent liquid removal).</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood is changed, or with which certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be reduced, reduced or reduced the dose.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetremixed thus slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The conversion of Pemetremixed in its active form goes lighter than in healthy cells, which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug with a longer activity of cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant Pleuramesothelielioma, Alimta was examined in a main study on 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which had previously been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of docetaxel (other medicines against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (a further drug against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients who were treated with Alimta and cisplatin had survived an average of 12.1 months, compared with 9.3 months during the sole administration of Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy first survival compared with Alimta 8.3 months, compared with 7.9 months at Docuaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">However, in both studies, cancer resulted in the cell epithelial cells in which cancer resulted in longer survival times during the administration of Alimta.</seg>

<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose Pemetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued during the entire treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexate dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive a intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before the first Pemetrexed dose as well as after each third party cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who received Pemetrexed, should be created before each gift a complete blood-image should be created, including differentiation of leukocytes and a trombozygum.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose inspection must be taking place in consideration of the Nadirs of blood circulation or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the previous therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the notes 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as a monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute of Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 blood.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Patients non-hematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 should develop (except neural toxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient must be the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled if in patients after 2 dose reductions or non-hematological toxicity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so- at the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no evidence that in patients aged 65 years or above, compared to patients aged 65 years, an increased by-effect risi- ko exists.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non-adequate data for the integrity and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials were not necessary in patients with a creatine Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dose adjustments that can go beyond all patients with recommended Dosissions.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data processing in patients with a creatine Clearance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function limit of &gt; 1.5 times of the upper cut value values and / or transaminases of &gt; &gt; 3.0 times of the upper limit value (at the presence of liver enzyme) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit value (in the presence of liver enzyme) are not specifically investigated in studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to the bone marker marker and Pemetrexed may not be administered to patients before whose absolute neutrophilic number reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the trombo- cyte number once again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophilennumber, thybozyginal number and maximum non-hematological toxicity, as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 hematological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed when a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 took place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetrexed treated patients, folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophyl- lactic measure to reduce the reduction related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must be avoided during therapy for at least 2 days before the therapy, at least 2 days before therapy, at least 2 days after therapy with peemetreed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients who are intended for therapy with Pemetrexed, must be avoided by NSAIDs with long semesters for at least 5 days prior to therapy, the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosteroid (a medicine that can be used as antiemetical).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years is not recommended to show the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient defined by a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptophamine (5HT, also known as Serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi has been studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong and moderate reacting for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">For chemotherapies, the strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients who were treated with Aloxi have no vomiting in 24 hours following chemotherapy (132 by 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">For chemotherapies, the moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with Aloxi have no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (153 from 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 from 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued a approval to the Company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals and a permit for placing Aloxi throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strong emetogenic chemotherapy, due to cancer disease and vomiting nausea and vomiting with moderate chemotherapy, due to cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi on the prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strong emetogenic chemotherapy, can be strengthened by adding a corticosterile chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can lengthen profound cologens should be monitored using an amnesty Obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus after injection of injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3-Antagonists, however, caution is charged with the same gift of palm onosetron with drugs used to extend the QT intervals or to an extension of such extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with other chemical agents, Aloxi should not be used to treat nausea and vomiting in those days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cycloabine, Cycloorubicin and Mitomycin C) investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of palletosetron and a steady concentration of metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population based on a population based pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6 inhibitors (dexamethasone, roxorubicin, roxorubicin, Chinidin, Rankings, Ritonvir, Sertralin and Terbinafin) had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences on the application of palm onosetron in human pregnancies lie not before, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied for pregnant women, unless it is necessary by the treated doctor than necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies, the most commonly used with a dose of 250 micrograms showed adverse events (a total of 633 patients), which were possibly associated with Aloxi in connection, headaches (9%) and obtaining (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of excess reactions and reactions on the administration of the administration (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing report.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar cases demonstrated to adverse events such as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose of active relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out, due to the large distribution volume, a dialysis probably does not have any effective therapy at a Aloxi- Overdoge.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies were earned a total of 1,132 patients with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cisplatin, Carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Cycloorron (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg of Dolasetron (half-time 7.3 hours) received intravenously per day 1 without dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study, 667 mg / m2Cisplatin were randomised, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine plus 250 or 750 microgram Palonosetron received patients who received 32 mg of Ondansetron, which were intravenously to day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strong petogenic chemotherapy are combined into the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron was comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of clinical investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the Ionenkcular De- and Repolarisation that participated in the ventricular channels and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The study of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the ECG effects of i.v. abated palm onosetron in individual doses of 0.25, 0,75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After an intravenous gift is followed by an initial acceptance of plasma concentrations a long-elimination from the body with an average terminal time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally disproportionately in the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 m / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Following an intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses between day 1 and day 5 measured median (± SD) increase in palletosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">In pharmacokinetetic simulations revealed that at once a daily intravenous gift of 0.25 mg Palonosetron was comparable to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) which was comparable to a one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg. however, the Cmax was 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated over the kidneys and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, compared to Palonosetron over less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 along the Metabolism of Palonosetron are involved.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination According to an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours of urine, Palonosetron as an unchanged active ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Following a single-time intravenous membrane in healthy, the overall body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In case of patients with severe liver function the terminal Eliminationshallow time and average systemic exposure to palonosetron is increased, however, reduction of the dose is however not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In previous clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions that indicates a sufficient relevance of clinical use in clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 A clinical studies showed that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of Ionite channels, which may be involved in the ventricular de- und repression.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonosetron (each dose were given in about 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given every day over two years, led to a multiple frequency of liver tumors, hyppitures, pancreas, spnierenmark) and skin tumors with rats, but not with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not known, but due to the used high doses and when Aloxi is determined in humans for a unique application, the relevance of these results will be small.</seg>

<seg id="2678">Chief indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies in the proportion of patients whose infection had dropped to the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 patients (85.6%) of the 139 patients under altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo had their treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin cells, Altargo and Cefalexin similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together during skin wounds, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups participated in the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, Altargo has detected that Altargo has caused hollow ceilings in body fabric or infections, which have been demonstrably or probably caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common adverse events with altargo (which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a maturation of the client.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Humanitarian Organizations (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Altargo during a short-time treatment of the following superficial skin infections exist: • Impetigo, the infected small laerations, scanned, or inclined wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007 the European Commission approved the company Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for placing on the market of Allogo into the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The patients where no improvements could be observed within two to three days, should be considered once again and an alternative therapy can be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of sensibilisation or serious local irritation by the application of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment is supposed to make the treatment carefully and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection are begun.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used for the treatment of infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen, or thought (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies in secondary inert, the efficacy of retapamulin was insufficient for patients with infections, caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), unsufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy is supposed to be considered if after a 2- or 3-day treatment, no improvements or deterioration of the infected place.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous application of retapamulin and other topical means of the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations, which were reached after human application on the diced skin or infected surface, a clinically relevant inhibiting in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After a continuous gift of 2 times a day 200 mg of ketoconazole increased the average retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe to the poor skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients can not be maintained if topical retapamulin is applied during a systematic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity according to oral intake and are insufficient in relation to a statement on the birth and the fötal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy, when an topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indexed and the use of Retapamulin is the gift of an systemic antibiotic treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2696">During the decision whether the breastplate continued / ends or terminated with Allogo / terminated, is between the benefit of the nursing and to the benefit of the alargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials over 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the alargo was used, the most frequently reported side effects on the administration, which is about 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">The action retapamulin is a half synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Clitopilus passeckanus (formerly Pleurotus passeckanus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The action mechanism of retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a given binary point of the 50s sub-unit of the bacterial Ribosomes which differs from the binding of other ribosomal antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the ties of the ribosomales protein L3 is involved in the region of the ribosomal P-ties and the Peptidyltransferring centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By liaison to this Binder Pleuromutiline, peptide-blocks, block-part interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Due to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of Retapamulin should appear in at least some infection forms, a consultation should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of Retapamulin opposite S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolate sensitive or resistant to methicillin were.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-appealing to the treatment of S.aureus the presence of tribes with additional virulators (like PVL = Pate-Valentine leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was released daily under occlusion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% retapamulin salts twice daily for 5 days for the topical treatment of secondary intreated wounds, single plasma were gained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the medication and in children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic recording at human application was reduced to 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibiting.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The Metabolism in vitro oxidative metabolism in human liver microsomen was primarily conveyed by CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used for the protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years, who are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied within the framework of an existing vaccination plan, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix can only be used when immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection, which can be brought to the end of two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a review dose is required against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or other Hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines can work with the immune system (the natural defences of the body), "how it can wake up against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immunological system identifies viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and creates antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Since 1996, Ambirix contains the same components such as the Twinrix adults and has been approved by Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect the same disease, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix are given an existing vaccination program within three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults, also used as a cover for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody in one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children, the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month gap between two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix resulted in between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection for development of anti-antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar in a six-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headaches, appetite, pain on the injection point, redness, tightness (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not react sensitive to patients who may react sensitively (allergic) to active ingredients, one of the other parts or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologchis.a. a permit for placing the placing on the placing of Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardised plan for the Grundimentation with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, with the first dose to choose between six and twelve months after the first dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a review impaired for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalizing vaccines or with a combined vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalizing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not completely secured whether immunohated persons who are addressed to an Hepatitis A- vaccine, as it may also be protected against immunological memory through the immunological memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As for all injections, the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction, according to the gift of the vaccine, appropriate options for medical treatment and monitoring is always available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a faster protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended that the 360 ELISA units forminactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinable Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hemalysis patients and persons with disruptions of the immune system, no adequate anti-HAVER and anti-hBS antibodies were observed, so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to an optimal impact folg, these injection routes should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In these cases, Ambirix can be injected directly at Thrombozytopenie or blood clauses, as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix was in the second year of a separate injection of a combined diphtherian, tetanusorem and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with a combined masseam vaccine was given to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients with immunodegrasive therapy or patients with immunity defects must be assumed that may not have sufficient immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study carried out with 3 vaccine doses of this formulation, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, gastroenteritis, headache and fever comparable to the incidence that was observed in the previous Thiomerano- and preservative vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines of Ambirix were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to and including 15 years, Ambirix was compared to the tolerability of Ambirix with the 3-component combination easier.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher number of pain and pain on a calculation basis per vaccination dose of Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects, compared with 39.1% of the subjects, compared with the gift of a dose of 3 doses combination.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination of vaccination reported 66.4% of the subjects, Ambirix had given to pain, over 63.8% of the subjects, which had been vaccinated with the 3-dosage combination.</seg>
<seg id="2756">The frequency of matter, however, was comparable (i.e. about the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects, Ambirix was compared to 36.2% in the subjects that received the 3-doses combination easier).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of preoperative pain and pain was low and comparable to the administration of combination with the 3-cans vaccine was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11 years of vaccines, the occurrence of local transactions and general interactions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable to the study involving the three-doses combination with 360 ELISA units and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, for the 6- to 11- year-olds, however, after vaccination with ambirix, a common occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, is reported annually.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines resulting from severe adverse events during the 2-doses vaccination with ambirix or during the 3-doses vaccination with the combination of hepatitis-A-virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis-B- surface antigen was not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical studies that were conducted at vaccines at ages 1 to and including 15 years, the service rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were issued one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, for month 6 (i.e., month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The service rates for anti-HBS was 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, for month 6 (i.e., in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study, which was conducted in 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were treated with three doses of combined combined with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 persons whose immunity was valuable, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher than hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 in the gift of the 3-dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which were reached in a clinical study of 1 to 11 year-old one month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines required either a 2-doses vaccination with ambirix or a 3-doses vaccination with a combination of 360 ELISA units formininactivated hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">People who were employed at the time of Grundimplization between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAVER and anti-HBS antibodies could be demonstrated at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune reaction against both antigens was comparable to which was determined according to vaccination of 3 doses with a combination simple, consisting of 360 ELISA units forminactivated hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study of 12- to including 15-year-olds, the persistence of anti-HAVER and anti-HBS antibodies could be similar to immunisation in the 0-6 months vaccine is comparable to the vaccination of 0-12 months.</seg>
<seg id="2770">When the first dose of Ambirix was in the second year of life simultaneously with a combined diphtherian, tetanusorem, type b vaccine vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of a combined mask Mumps-vaccines was administered, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study, which was performed with 3 doses of the present formulation of adults, showed similar seroprotection and serrate rates as for the previous formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2791">But it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine is given at the same time with ambirix, should be vaccinated in separate places and as possible as various limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">When Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of impregnancies, it is likely that the response to the vaccine is still enough.</seg>

<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which have been announced since the issuance of the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP has shown that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix was only transferred to a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Amamaps may also be used in patients with incomplete enzyme faulty or hyperammonic encephalia (brain compensation due to high protein concentrations) in the pre-history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonounce is split into meals - split by several single doses of meals - lluded under the food or via a gastric acid (through the stomach-leading hose) or a noblonde (through the nose into the stomach-leading hose).</seg>

<seg id="2812">Under "extraordinary circumstances," as due to the condition of the disease at the time of approval, only limited information to this drug templates.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indexed in all patients where a complete enzyme has already been manifested in newborn age (within the first 28 life-days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with late manifold form (incomplete enzyme defective, which is manifested according to the first life of life) there is a indication for the use when in the Anamnese a hyperammonic Enceptional encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow up tablets or for patients with hatch disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in Granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated considering the protein tolerance and the development of necessary daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with a body weight over 20 kg and with herbite and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">For patients who suffer from an early manifold lack of carcinamylphosphatylase or Ornithintranscylase, the substitution of Citylin or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with a arginosuccine synthetic deficiency need Arginine deficiency in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets are not given to patients with hatch disturbances, as a risk for the emergence of Ösophagus crush, if the tablets do not reach immediately in the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, corresponding to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Therefore, AMMONAPS should therefore be used to treat patients with congestion insufficiency or heavier renal failure, as well as with sodium and oil formation only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because Metabolisation and deposition of sodium phenylbutyrat about the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used in patients with liver or kidney insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contra-indicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">With subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowdown of neurons and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There were also a delayed tire of cerebrational synapses and a reduced number of functional nerve obligations in the brain and thereby an handicap of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be found that phenylacetate is eliminated in the breast milk, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS during the standstill time (see 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported from a 18-year-old anodesktic patient who developed a metabolic Encepan in combination with lactazide, severe mortar openia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdosage occurred in a 5-month-old small child with an interesting single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms occur with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed an intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dosisanal neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metaboliic active compound which is conjugated by acetylamine with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is left over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stress biometrically seen is phenylacetylglutamine with urea comparable (both connections contain 2 nitric atoms); Phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to be overcoming from excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disruptions of the urinary cycle can be assumed that for each gram, sodium bicphenylbutyrat can be produced between 0,12 and 0.15 g Phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis was early and the treatment started immediately to improve the survival chances and the clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The forecast of the earliest manifold form of the disease with occurrence of the first symptoms in the newborn age was almost always infaust, and the disease led itself in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids, or with its nitrogen-free analogues for the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By Hemodialysis, the utilisation of alternative way of nitrogen oxide (sodium debutyrat, sodium bicide and toxic amino acids), it was possible to increase survival rate as recent at postpartal (however within the first life month) to increase diseases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients the survival rate was 100%, but even in those patients with many intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with late manifold form of the condition (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the Ornithintranscylase-deficiency), which were treated with an hyperammonic Enceptible y and afterwards permanently treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a proteined diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurologic deficits are hardly irreversible in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that Phenylbutyrat is oxidized to Phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney disease with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were obtained after the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in an empty healthy adult and in patients with interference of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolism was also examined for cancer patients according to intravenous gift of sodium chloride (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablets, 15 minutes after the intake of phenylbutyrat were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cyclic disturbances or hemophileopathies was detectable according to different doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) in the next morning, no phenylacetate in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">Three of six patients with liver cirrhosis which were repeated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three single doses) were treated with the mean Phenylacetate concentration in plasma concentration on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">The medication is eliminated in 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus tests, sodium chloride was not treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is taken orally taken (mammals and children who can't swallow up tablets or patients with hatch disorders) or by a gastric acid or Nasenonde.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with a body weight over 20 kg and with herbite and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (in particular branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">For patients who suffer from an early manifold lack of carcinamylphosphatylase or Ornithintranscylase, the substitution of Citylin or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrat, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, corresponding to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When Rattened was exposed to Phenylacetate (active metastasis of phenylbutyrat), it came to lesions in the pyramid cells of the Hirnrinde.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported from a 18-year-old anodesktic patient who developed a metabolic Encepan in combination with lactazide, severe mortar openia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>

<seg id="2858">Based on analysis of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disruptions of the urinary cycle can be assumed that for each gram, sodium bicphenylbutyrat can be produced between 0,12 and 0.15 g Phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurologic deficits are hardly irreversible in treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in granulatform, 15 minutes after the intake of phenylbutyrat were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can store the completed product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">With this approach the small measuring spoon 0,95 g, the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g of sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient must receive the medicine via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved before use in water (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot be able to absorb proteins in the body after consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you study laboratory tests, you must take the doctor to take AMMONAPS, because sodium phenylbutyrat can influence the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used for the treatment of adult patients with "acute Coronarsyndroms" (ACS, reduced blood supply) (a form of pain in breast basket with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "ST- Hebung" (a anomal measurement value of electrocardiology or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who are subjected to a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This may contribute to the heart of maintaining a blood flow in patients with Angina or cardiac disease and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Close to 14 000 patients participated in the main study about the treatment of ACS at the treatment of angiox in sole gift or in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, a different medicines for preventing blood clots) with a conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulans) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI the patient was often used a stent (a short sleeves that remains in the artery to prevent a clasp) and they received additional medicines for preventing blood clots, such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">At the treatment of ACS was angiox - with or without gift of GPI - with the prevention of new events (deaths, cardiac disease or Revascularisation) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who undergo a PCI, Angiox worked as effective in all indicators as effective as Heparin, except for severe bleeding, with which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox cannot be used in patients who may be sensitive to Bivalirudin, other brain cases or other parts of the other.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had a blood of blood, as well as with people with strong blood pressure or heavy kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Angiox during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is a replacement for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Medicines Company UK Ltd. a permit for placing angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute graonaract (instabile Angina / NGOs) with a emergency handle or when an early intervention is foreseen.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous type of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If one result is performed in another result, an additional Bolus of 0.5 mg / kg and the infusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI requirements, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h may be recorded for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg must be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial IV inhibitor of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a intravenous intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of an allotoxical gift of angiox was not examined and is not recommended, even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second grade of 0.3 mg / kg / kg must be effected.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine before application should be carefully mixed and the closing dose quickly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value exceeds more than 225 seconds, a further surveillance is no longer necessary, provided the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">For patients with medium-severe kidney disease (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which is subjected to a PCI (whether with bivalirudin against ACS is treated or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, the ACT is administered at 0.3 mg / kg and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney compensation, which led to the Phase II I- PCI trial (Replace-2) which led to the approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bivalirudin-Bolus without dose efficiency at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 For patients with severe kidney compensation (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialytic patients the angiox contraindications (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">The treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after finishing the intravenous gift of unfracated Heparin or 8 hours after the termination of the subcutaneous gift of Dutch Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• Focensitivity of the active ingredient or other components or against miludine • active blood disorders or increased blood risk disorders. • heavier uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endometry. • severe kidney compensation (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysis required patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully examined during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of blood, especially when Bivalirudin was administered in combination with another anticoagulans (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if using existing PCI patients under Bivalirudin most blood vessels of arterial points may occur in patients who occur in a percutaneous Koronarintervention (PCI), while the treatment is primarily associated with bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are treated with warfarin and treated with bivalirudin, a monitoring of INR-value (International standardization ratio) should be observed in order to ensure that the value reached after setting the treatment with bivalirudin again before treatment of existing levels.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge of the action mechanism of antibacterial ulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombozyna aggregates) can be assumed that these efficiencies increase the risk of blood.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of Bivalirudin with Thrombozytenders or anticoagulants are clinical and organic hematology parameters in any case regularly.</seg>

<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalirudin group as well as in those treated with Heparin treated groups, women and patients over 65 years were more common in adverse events than male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding were defined according to ACUITY and Timi standards for heavy bleeding such as in table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding occurred in Bivalirudin alone significantly less than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraocular bleeding, intraocular bleeding, hematology with a diameter ≥ 5 g / dL with known blood flow, refusing to transfusion, use of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed blood vessels, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally), "other" points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on adverse events are based on data of a clinical study involving bivalirudine in 6000 patients who undergo a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin group as well as in those treated with Heparin treated groups, women and patients over 65 years were more common in adverse events than male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred in significantly less than in the comparative group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects that are not listed above were reported in practice after comprehensive application and are combined in Table 6 according to system organs.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosage the treatment with bivalirudine is immediately repeating and the patient engage in view of a blood of blood.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific Thrombinoor, which binds both at the catalytic center as well as at the Anionenbinge region of Thrombin, regardless of whether Thrombin in the liquid phase or to Gerinnsel is bound.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binaries of Bivalirudin to Thrombin, and with its effect, is reversible because Thrombin relieves the binaries of Bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4, thereby reducing the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Furthermore, through Bivalirudin with serum of patients, where it was come to hedge-induced Thrombozytopenie / heparininduced Thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS), no thybotes reaction reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and patients, Bivalirudin shows a dossier and concentric anti-oxidative effect that is occupied by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If in the patient was carried out a PCI, an additional Bolus of 0.5mg / kg bivalirudin was given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.75mg / kg / h should be increased.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In arm A of the ACUITY study was administered infractioned Heparin or Enoxaparina, according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute Koronarsynsyndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / non-ST-midrange (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>

<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the field of abdominal ceiling, to apply or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the area of abdominal bags.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose level capacity and diminished insulating metabolism, the insulin needs can be decreased in patients with a limitation of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of efficiency, the trademark (Her- Steller), insulin typs (normal, NPH, zinkdelays etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can withdraw a change of insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dosage or breakdown of a treatment, especially in patients with a insulin-imposed diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacacid. these states are potentially lified.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of a patient to another insulin type or a insulin in another manufacturer should take place under stringent supervision and may make a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of a hypoglycaemia depends on the action profile of the insulin treatment and can therefore change to change the treatment schematic.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To increase the substances which amplify the blood sugar of hypoglycemia, include orale antidiabetic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, pentoxifylline, Propoxypha, Salizylates and Sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytics such as Betabstainers, Clonidin, Guanethidin, Guanethidin, and Reserpin, the symptoms of admiths are weakened or missing or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies for reproductive toxicity had no differences between Insu- lingicin and Humaninsulin in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, the birth or post-natal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known if insulin-ulin occurs in the human breast milk but in general insulin is not above, nor in mother's milk, it is resorated after orally application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">The resulting from clinical studies are listed below. ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; often: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare (frequency on the basis of disposal).</seg>

<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is failed to continuously change the injection area within the injection area may occur in the consequence of a Lipodystrophy on the injection area.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with consciousness can be given by a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg) which is given by a physician, or by an intravenous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose in a hospital, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine thing for the heavy hypoglycaemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces the blood sugar level by stimulating glucose recovery (especially by skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting the glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous Ga- be of insulin deformation faster and the activity of activity shorter than at hug manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes tampinglulisin in the therapeutically relevant metering range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional increase in the gluing effect, just like human ulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has twice as fast active ingredients like normal humanistic ulin and achieved the complete gluing effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human ulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data was evident that in a application of insulin delivery in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable postural glycemic control is achieved as with human normal insulin, which is 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insulin-ulin was done in 2 minutes before meal, a better post-depth control than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is turned in 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycemic control, such as human normal insulin, which is given 2 tends before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin delivery in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before the beginning of the meal was given (figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin delivery in gift of 15 minutes (GLULISIN - after the start of the meal), after the beginning of the meal, was given in 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
