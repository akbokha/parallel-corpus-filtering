the module replacement filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar in the ex@@ tras filter . with the module you can filter &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current directory directory on different type filters .
in order to display the DO@@ M tree in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or , please select Ex@@ tras DO@@ M tree here ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M shown here . as default the display begins with the root element of the document , e.g. : docum@@ ent@@ element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root canal .
the module &amp; fs@@ view ; for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view of objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbols and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the feature of &amp; fs@@ view ; consists in it , par@@ ach@@ ed folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of the so @-@ called Tree Map @-@ Map allow the representation of the size of objects in missing structures . each object is equivalent to its size . this size must have the sum of the size of the sub@@ ordin@@ ated objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object .
in &amp; fs@@ view ; the size of a folder is defined as the sum of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries is defined . according to this way , large files can be detected , even if they are far below in the folder hier@@ archy . therefore , &amp; fs@@ view ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command can be viewed .
in &amp; fs@@ view ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap @-@ depic@@ ts a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for simpler navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have the rec@@ tan@@ gles of full colour coding and labelling settings .
the colour of a rectangle that is switched on view color mode can be switched to a depth for easy detection of the c@@ ach@@ ting depth or the figure of another file size such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rectangle can be lab@@ eled with the various properties of the respective file or folder . for each property you can determine whether it is possible to appear even if sufficient space is to be displayed or whether the surface of sub@@ ordin@@ ated str@@ ates are to be used . Moreover , you can set the relative position of the label in the rectangle below .
in the display algorithm for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the surface should not be observed . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; fs@@ view ; this goal is not always available to show the disappearance of entries , and this frame is not always available , which is less space for the frame , if the square is square .
as a division of the area of an entry was made for the sub@@ ordin@@ ated entries , the implementation will remain so important for the reference and to avoid space losses through the frame always contains square . the best methods for lines , columns or recur@@ sive second line .
you can set the minimum view on the menu entry for an entry over the menu entry . instead , a room sample is drawn in the area of the ordered entry , in order to view that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordin@@ ated entry .
originally was &amp; fs@@ view ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets developed , which was developed for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .

&amp; digi@@ plug ; contains a fast image processing with basic training tools . you can use this to evaluate your photos , comment and correct . processing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image plug@@ ins ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ ous ; easy to use , it represents d@@ utz@@ ing professional skills . it works fully in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color rendering workflow .
improved database with much more met@@ ad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; on the camera or the lens that can be visited .
like all &amp; K@@ DE ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ ous ; an open source project . that means it is to support the end support . you should therefore report problems and improvements .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; tries to make the mel@@ ody of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , your web browser opens a page in the error system . all the required information are already registered here . follow the instructions to send your account .
&amp; digi@@ came ; is a project supported by a community . if you have a regular user of &amp; digi@@ ous ; if you wish to answer questions about other users of &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can answer any questions about other users . in this mail@@ box , you should therefore speak English , you should therefore need this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ ous page ; homepage to get news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ ous ; see .
the best start to join &amp; digi@@ ous ; is the registration in the developer ma@@ iling list . guide to login in the developers ma@@ iling list of &amp; digi@@ came ; .
if you sign &amp; digi@@ ers ; you are asked to save your pictures and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folders . simply enter a local , remote or remote folders . simply enter the folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains equal to all image folders .
later you can add many folders as you want to add . &amp; digi@@ ous ; you will additionally use as Al@@ ben@@ Library . settings digi@@ plug are included .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top file , the pictures , as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ came ; viewed each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . during the search of the folder you get a progress report as shown :
&amp; digi@@ ous ; dur@@ ations seek the li@@ br@@ arian path in its whole depth . you can not expos@@ e any sub@@ folder , unless you come into hidden folders . this can do exceptional bs &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can do a point in front of the folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a basic folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ List will not take photos as symbols . you can change the album by clicking on the folder . this will then be used as the album symbol . further details can be found in the albums .
once you have configured the basic folder , you can setup into &amp; digi@@ ers ; you should learn your digital camera . then you should learn how to use my albums and my key@@ word to manage your photos into the albums .
ec@@ top@@ ology support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so it can handle &amp; digi@@ plug . if you want to figure out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Roh@@ kam@@ er@@ a@@ Support .
as you setup this and working with raw files are described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ o@@ der@@ Street and Ro@@ h Work@@ flow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera body is provided to you with your digital camera and your photos can be downloaded directly in &amp; digi@@ ous ; albums . of course , each medium is supported by the library g@@ photoelectric 2 . of course , every medium and any card reader is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ ous ; together .
modern digital cameras are character@@ ised by using Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for the actual transmission to the computer , the camera is often used as a disk drive . the camera is then used as a disk drive . the camera can also use the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras are using the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for digital cameras , which supports an continuously increasing number of digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images of digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for its communication with the computer . as photos in general files are un@@ folded and trans@@ missions through the serial port are slowly sol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ came ; supports this cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photoelectric 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ ip@@ h support and therefore need to read the preview pictures of the digi@@ plug . the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photoelectric 2 . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photoelectric 2 , you can possibly be unable or could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; digi@@ ous ; is how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I module : the K@@ DE Image Interface Interface Project ( manual ) is a base of a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ ous ; K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manip@@ ulate images in almost any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ ous ; by writing a small module to complement one function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ came ; even perform .
to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove the side bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
the drag and set of images anywhere : you can put a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , on the horizontal separ@@ ating line or any other application window . the only limitation is that a picture is not in keywords , data list or search .
- a file selection allows you to lift up the broad@@ est settings : JPEG , P@@ NG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that is currently displayed in the tool@@ bar . so the fil@@ tering works on the fil@@ en@@ ames only if this ind the tool@@ bar is also displayed . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ ds settings .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ ch@@ equ@@ ot ; presents a organized view of your photo albums . these albums can be saved in a single album , where they were created on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the aven@@ ues , or after the date when the album was first changed . the date can be changed in the characteristics of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also select an album Import images . you can also add a screenshot directly to an album . choose an album Import Screen photo .
in order to move a picture from an album to another or move , you can select the picture with the mouse to the target album and copy it . you can move to the same way or copy all photos . simply select all photos and move them to the target album .

Alb@@ um@@ - collections : are a method to mark your albums , so you can select under a common name . you can select the collection from the tool bar or view albums from the collection . if you want to add new collections , you can add this in the settings for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort up your albums after date with view albums after date of sort .
the buttons en El@@ ders , average , latest : this set the date on the oldest , the latest picture or the average of the album . this is first attempts to calculate the pictures from their EX@@ IF information . if this is missing , the date of last change can be used in this folder instead .
when you first came a album in &amp; digi@@ came ; the first picture of the album was selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ ch@@ te@@ ot , selected . this is the first photo in the album . sometimes it is not prestigious and you want to select a different photo as a symbol .
to select a different photo as an album icon , you &apos;ll need to click the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; In addition , you can draw the photo on the album in the list to make it as a symbol .
an album can be included only in one collection , and collections may not be bl@@ asted .
&amp; digi@@ came ; supports the input of samples for individual photos in the area of my sample list below the main window . album collections have another effect . you can always use all photos of the album . you can naturally use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window presents you the main view of your photos . when you select an album , all images are displayed in this album window . each picture is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these curtains in the tool@@ bar .
if you open a album the first time you will have to wait for a short time while the preview pictures are generated . you can avoid new pictures in which you want to create in the Menu Ex@@ tras .

you should be aware that , after processing through other image processing programs , you can not save data with the image processing programs . some programs do not store this data when you modified the modified image . thereby , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , Bl@@ end , etc .
&amp; digi@@ came ; introduces two ways to spin . the eas@@ iest way to click on the preview and select . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photos , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview and select F2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you will keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ ti@@ f , &amp; etc ; ) .

&amp; digi@@ came ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows pictures to compare these signatures . depending on the difference between two image signals , each more they meet . this technology is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is a field in which you can drop any image . by means of a sw@@ elling , the results can be increased or reduced . if you move a picture from somewhere about the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side bar , then you will open it and you can leave it there .
sk@@ et@@ ches : free hand @-@ color sk@@ et@@ ches : draw a fast sk@@ et@@ ches and &amp; digi@@ ous ; find the matching pictures . also here , a tail value can be set .
this rider does an intuitive map search tool available on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ ature program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within this coordinates will be filtered and displayed . these sets of course these pictures G@@ eo @-@ data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your G@@ eo @-@ filters . this will then be added to a later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ came ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . he works with all supported image data formats , even raw files , together .
choose one or more images from any view in the main window , and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L To the lumin@@ ary table . if you come back in &amp; sign ; main window are , you can open the lights quickly with L ex@@ tras .
from the preview bar you can draw the pictures you want to compare , in the left or right area of the window . if you preview reading from the tool@@ bar and the zo@@ o or shift operation , this will also be done with the other picture , so you can compare the same area of both pictures .
another mode is better suited to assem@@ ble quickly out of a picture series , then the two pictures will navigate within the areas to the same page . now use the left mouse button at any side view , in order to view it in the right section . this simpli@@ fies you through a series of similar pictures .
of course the normal del@@ etion actions work directly from the lumin@@ ary like F4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both models in light table . this makes it e.g. simple visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom end of each area you will find a built @-@ in sw@@ ing@@ ing function , which you can recognize to the visible arrows . in order to rotate the visible area of the image , you need to view it and write the &amp; L@@ MB ; both pictures will then show the same image range .
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . simply use the zoom @-@ kno@@ b under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel around the image in and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both images if you &apos;re in the mode preview .
what is a digital publisher @-@ management - away from the fashion word ? digital surveys have been taken every part of the process after the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos shows , sc@@ anned or digital photos stores a form of digital surveys , but most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient manner .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips to secure your pictures , feel free to use and use photos . we are concentr@@ ating on the procedures for digital photography , remove , backup , evaluate , evaluate , evaluate , evaluate , help , help and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital Monitoring management takes on , inde@@ xed , categorized , ensures , trans@@ forms , conf@@ ection@@ ed and exported content that have a mon@@ etic or cultural value . quot ;
met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data on data . met@@ ad@@ ata are defined according to your definition data to provide information on or a documentation of other data provided by any application or environment .
I need to claim if you don &apos;t need more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t need to know how many photos you have , then do not use &amp; digi@@ ous ; . if you don &apos;t know how much photos you don &apos;t have to save &amp; digi@@ ous ; . the approach to store the met@@ ad@@ ata is guaranteed very fast searching and secure backup to those with other programs , platforms and formats freely .
the first what you do and know what to maintain in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to data structure . you need to decide whether you want to save them on a reserved drive , or on a network running &amp; etc . note that you must change sometime on a larger drive .
maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly on your location . if you have enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; you will then publish a folder for pictures that you want to print or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have different requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archiving , working processes , constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % are working files and you will not re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files do together ? the separation of file types makes the stack of easier . split new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are searching for an original or derived image .
we also recommend to save the met@@ ad@@ ata in the site of met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ ous ; if you forget this , then you can save the met@@ ad@@ ata data from the database to the files by clicking on the menu album the corresponding item .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change that ? it represents &amp; digi@@ ous ; they are a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected At@@ tri@@ bu@@ cks . these are of course the most important .
now , the real work begins , since you should select all images that you need to select the same attri@@ bute and the value . of course , you can start the same attri@@ bute and the value . this makes sense when you can concentrate on top of the best pictures .
now let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords , how you are often hot in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import@@ ing catal@@ og@@ gles images from a different source with embedded sample , then the pictures will be attached to the right place . this sort of the hier@@ archy is not problem and can be easily done by pulling a sub @-@ tree to another . the modified keywords are being pursued by &amp; digi@@ ous ; updated while the under@@ trees are tra@@ cked .
the graph shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata is over@@ cut . this is a very rough representation because each block of met@@ ad@@ ata is made in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data is properties of all pictures .
enough the keywords - the next section rel@@ ates to labels or comments using the third major tool to catal@@ og@@ ze your met@@ ad@@ ata .
most people want to see your photos just see , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are sure to arrive interested in your photos .
look at this panoramic view . from Fer@@ ne is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look closer look , then catch some details , people , the place .
and now I say you this of the landing area of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing , memories , the historical period is present again , you may even hear the silence , so you can even hear the silence of this panoramic pictures completely .
for other photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you have shown pictures you should tell a story . remember to help him , the key is to help you know about the motive that it moves to understand what you understand .
it is fine , if a picture is not perfect when it has the strength only with a label for himself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can save a lot of text in an internation@@ al@@ pha@@ bet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) as lab@@ eling . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . if you want to export your images in web galleries , then you will tell the story about your wishes and / or the title of Web Gal@@ ery system .
do you remember the time before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a bor@@ ing planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now is already with light speed .
the possibilities of the ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already in@@ numer@@ able , and can be sure that a day , in the near future , you can also open the photos at the recording venue . you can also download K@@ ML files . you can also view the pictures at the recording venue . you can also export the pictures at the recording venue . you can also export images on the recording venue . you can also export the pictures at Google Maps 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with Google Earth viewer viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and design@@ ates the practice of copy@@ rights to remove limitations about the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also valid in all modified versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you that information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ came ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
the author ( syn@@ onym for actors and author ) : this field was to add your name , or the name of the photographer , e.g. in order to protect the name of the photographer , e.g. in order to be saved the name of a company or organization . according to that value , it should not be changed . this field does not support Com@@ mas nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as a partition .
car itel ( syn@@ onym for author ) : linked to the author . examples of this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples for this can be title like : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a mer@@ k to the car field , this is necessary to be completed .
editor ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : do not use the image file to identify which this photo has . this must not necessarily be the author . if the photographer is shown here , you can offer this Organ@@ izations here . if the picture is a camp photo , then the group / Agency offers the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this is not a lot more than base knowledge in work with calcul@@ ator , or change the solution for this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is especially important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ plug ; it is available in the near future , such a module for stack@@ ing processing .
topics : record error , failure , current failure , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , des@@ ast@@ er@@ esis , lifetime , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ st@@ itions
of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the road or a fire . these kind of dis@@ si@@ sts are those that can happen to you with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section there are problems with the so @-@ called new media .
Kro@@ ll On@@ track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics that have a data loss .
in order to tackle the problem with CDs / DVDs , you have to do this pre@@ diction and you may not get more than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether they believe it is in your accessi@@ bility .
CD / DVD discs can be readable , but you can use this risk in which you can use good dis@@ cos and good recording devices . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much reliable . so it rot@@ ates to select the right .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to errors , even if you have just written only . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect it . 75 % of the data are only needed for form@@ att@@ ing and the control sum@@ s . despite this massive protection it is required by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust and etc .
for defective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ B@@ uster , which works apparently with CDs and DVDs , but is not available for Mac@@ s . there is also similar applications the damaged data of damaged flo@@ ppy disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to save the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything which was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also considered for the Blu @-@ ray disk .
burn slow with a good recording on high quality media in a non @-@ quality media . read the media with a description , date &amp; author pass@@ marks and afterwards on a clean , dark dry and in animals protected area . don &apos;t forget to read the data on the next generation of media or software that can read the media .
disk manufacturer retain your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer guarantee include a new disk , but not the data . Google has a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks available : dis@@ missing disk missing
shortly : dis@@ co@@ inci@@ des in the operating temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C , the error rate increases dram@@ atically . electronic parts of the Control@@ lers are the most frequent error correction . some of SM@@ ART can termin@@ ate this mist@@ akes . this is particularly reading errors and failure . the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only around the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also secured data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually produce without large problems .
while most electric appliances are not much , the devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these an@@ om@@ al@@ ies may cause serious damage , hardware e@@ al@@ izing , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect it even before inev@@ itable that leads to a loss of time and money .
most common protection against electricity points is a over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absor@@ bs and the rest . it is usually available in the shape of a plug @-@ in . think it is normally a over@@ voltage socket .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should respect the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . they should also be sure that it protects against fl@@ ashes , so that it protects properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage can use any cable to your computer , you should also use it all peri@@ pher@@ als which can be connected to your system . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage levels that also include a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mo@@ dems and television .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ eb@@ ooks , and therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for the traveling .
while a over@@ voltage protection will protect your system in front of smaller variations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete loss . even a few seconds can bring to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protection against over@@ voltages , these devices can automatically make battery energy available . some models allow them even further to work up to the current . if you purchase a UPS , you should even be sure that they are the same quality requirements such as over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the life time of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
consider the potential risk to avoid your computer system and compare its safety against electricity problems with the cost of avoid@@ ance of these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be paid up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference when you need to keep your computer . at the end , you should always think all cables to tr@@ ast in the holiday .
the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is another popular offer with which you can save any amount of data .
however , they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar bill ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar bill ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data on the compar@@ atively slow internet .
solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution but it is not a general backup solution . therefore it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures at your disposal , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dram@@ atically more . for $ 25 per year , you get unlimited memory , which should be checked out in reality .
from the point of view of data backup , web solutions are very secure . transmission errors will be automatically adjusted in accordance with the TCP protocol and is included in the offer a backup and a covered memory . so they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ able .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transfer errors . the file system and b@@ tr@@ fs represent at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that there is no one that has occurred in your hardware . all these disorders remain un@@ discovered until you have not been destroyed during your computer . no one seems to have any protection in your computer . no one seems to have any protection . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much saf@@ er data way than that of your computer .
un@@ reliable network supplies are a further source for transfers losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within data streams . in normal file systems this error remains un@@ noticed .
even if you are not affected particularly by transfers problems you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of mist@@ akes every year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates , which can handle with record missing on low level and is available with one of the G@@ PL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ ash file system . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanism the z@@ fs and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is still not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate that ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in not@@ ebook and 46 % at workplace systems . for not@@ eb@@ ooks , the proportion of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the most expensive . it leads to a lower damage , e.g. theft or new installations ; and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; already no longer have been sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less vulner@@ able for data loss as propri@@ etary systems : false , N@@ TF@@ S is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ F@@ s , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . a very good English articles can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and un@@ defined status is avoided during an operation is not completely saved before the problem was lost , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings are removed from fundamental physical limits . it is a natural limit for that progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result . even DSLR cameras , your limit for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras you need a full format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard disk drive you are responsible for 100 &amp; euro cents . thus , you do not need any data loss for data loss . thus , your data is often affected by a data loss , and try this backup before you do anything else than the re@@ installation of your operating system to make exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives .
supp@@ ose you supp@@ ose your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash strikes you &apos;re lucky if the drive was not connected in the moment .
a disaster suggests locally and destro@@ ys a lot . do not forget aircraft farming : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough . they usually concern one whole space or entire house .
therefore disin@@ tegr@@ ation is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up to the stairs to the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above , it is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the pan@@ ic . if you have a backup , which is not available immediately , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files will be secured . it is a moment without history and represents a complete copy of any time .
differential protection : a backup of files have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete moment of time to two tim@@ eline : the complete safegu@@ arding and the final differential protection .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of files have been changed since the last backup . this creates a snap@@ shot at any time . this backup will once again produce a ver@@ sion@@ ing system on the next with the exception that it is only ab@@ stain@@ ed and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that can easily be set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file trans@@ missions . r@@ sync only the difference of files the really changed . this happens and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
secure important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or other visual media .
this approach lets you make enough time to dis@@ covering losses and restore . at the same time , you come to restore a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moment of application for at least one month and a moment for each month . every additional di@@ lution should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retained , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re @-@ finding images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visibility , ... , usage of the Internet .
to get valuable images the next 40 years , that is about the period of you really interested in you , because they are interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
because the future is un@@ predic@@ table because of your nature , you need to look at all this day . unfortunately , there is no other possibility to ask yourself as the current system back@@ ward . every 5 @-@ 8 years , you should ask yourself as the current system back@@ wards compatible . if less variants you have used in the past , so it is easier to evaluate the issues of the future .
this question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards which are supported by many applications .
virtualization is nowadays available for everyone . if you have an old system , so that you are important to read your pictures , then keep it on and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite easy : if you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay in open standards .
scal@@ ability is the expert pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this means always enlarge .
let &apos;s go out that you have set the scal@@ ability with the plan and enlarge the area you want to enlarge a dedicated disk or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store them to a new record :
check the d@@ mes@@ g command whether your new record is detected by the system , but do not hang it .
/ dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / S@@ DC / S@@ DC # source is / dev / S@@ DC # source , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; B ; size of the plate in MB@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and travel agents ; resi@@ du@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of departure if necessary
open Source Standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if a day no software can be read more , then you can create this task . this task will be easier by year to year .
GIF is a propri@@ etary , patented format which dis@@ appears slowly from the market . you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG was developed as an open source file to replace the GIF . however , it &apos;s a loss that supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can store gam@@ ma@@ - and chrom@@ ati@@ city data for improved color information , but not as many as TIFF needs and a slow compression . this format would like to store you to store your pictures .
TIFF was widely used as an image format . TIFF can store in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm . a problem is not needed to store your images in this format . there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licensed and open screen format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG was developed based on the need for met@@ ad@@ ata . a handy camera manufacturer is now available and we hope to use the competitors for Canon and Nikon .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology ; a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . this is a label of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored in a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved the XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers pull it before a original of your photo , which can be archi@@ ved in the shell format . however , the met@@ ad@@ ata can store separately from the image file , but it can be noted , as indicated above , the raw format . therefore , you should over@@ lay it if you use D@@ NG as a container , and lay all there together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ ad@@ ata Initiative is an open organisation that supports fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata standards that supports a wide range of applications and business models , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and explan@@ atory efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera , you can use this as temporary backup .
convert cru@@ de files to D@@ NG and store them in your Roh@@ archives . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fine processing , you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ ous ; then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata . these were cut off from the other programs .
protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it then to Web@@ gal@@ eries , en@@ code to MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc .
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ous ; in the section add a photos to a album , you can add photos that you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface offers you many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; use this with the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , this is trying to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , the fil@@ en@@ ame is available at the bottom end and the preview pictures of all photos . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file rules for each file , photos , movies , music etc , are displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need any camera information to any entry . with the side bars features and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information to be saved internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded yet to your computer . note that for some digital cameras not all information available .
the hor@@ semen met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal metals such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer re@@ mark , GPS etc . this information is the same as with the met@@ ad@@ ata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ ous ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ ad@@ ata is not available for some digital cameras .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to download photos on your computer , is the click download and then download the selection of All your camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ ous ; . when downloading images are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were stored in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired standard selection methods of &amp; K@@ DE . once you select the photos selected , use the button Download and then selected selected . the button Selected is full as long as you have selected some photos .
when your camera supports this , is a new option available . this pictures have now not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ ous ; in this case , the new pictures have been marked with a star in advance window . if you select this option , of course the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you can download the buttons , download or selected from selected files , a dialog appears where you can select the target album , as the list of existing albums , you can read in the list of my albums , and then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after which you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ ous ; invites the photos from the camera into the album .
once you downloaded the desired photos , you can delete these from the camera . you can er@@ ase all of them by clicking the button . if you want to delete the button all , you &apos;ll need to select this first and er@@ ase selected delete entries .
note that there are no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera . you should be sure to delete the photos into a &amp; digi@@ ous ; -@@ album have been downloaded , before you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera memory , this is much faster .
cameras use as a fil@@ en@@ ame for photos often do not use special meaning@@ ful name . the fil@@ en@@ ames are often dischar@@ ged in the same album , if you can download photos of several recordings into the same album . therefore , it may be meaning@@ ful to integrate the date and time to integrate the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors of the image and for data @-@ based sub@@ sid@@ y . if you use this latter option , will automatically create a folder per day .
the options While the transfer opens three further options to be carried out before the photos on the disk is stored . if you select this , the corresponding items from EX@@ IF information can be copied to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you wish to use a different date format as the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % % H : % M S . please switch the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the command @-@ time .
if you are using the camera fil@@ en@@ ame option , you have the possibility to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in lower@@ case . or in case letters if you prefer .
the new file name , which was used &amp; digi@@ plug ; for a photo is displayed below the name , the camera is displayed in preview . your settings will be saved and automatically used when you can open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ came ; may use all the information on the orientation of the camera to perform a automatic spin during shut@@ down . not all cameras are ready for download . in section side@@ bar met@@ ad@@ ata , you can read more details about the information which has embedded your camera into the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t supply this information , &amp; digi@@ ous ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want the automatic turn off , use the button Create and select the Automatic rotation in the lower range of the window .
if your camera was made information about the date on which the photo has been made available , you can use &amp; digi@@ ous ; this sub@@ stit@@ ches are loaded on the image data . all images with the same date are uploaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras can be read in the same sub album . in section side@@ bar Meta @-@ data you can read which information can be embedded in photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ ous . if you want to change this option , you need to switch this option . use this option , and select the date file @-@ based sub@@ al@@ ies at the bottom end of the window .
the eas@@ iest way to download from your computer to your camera is button to download . select the file selection dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; appears where you can select the files uploaded to you . you can also select more than one file using the default &amp; K@@ DE ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ ous ; you , where the pictures should be loaded too . a folder selection dialog appears for the camera . select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Positi@@ oning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this is a position that can be displayed in long@@ itudes and lat@@ itude , which can be displayed on a map . the determination of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photo prints , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical place . not everyone uses an airplane to record a field through automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architectural office and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have later forgotten , where exactly the photo was done , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ous ; users can , who want to document the place of photos , or simply only this aspect , it is good the position data of a photos .
the question is how to get the GPS data in the picture ? first , you should know that ec@@ iv@@ 2 are supported , such as the data in these fields ? there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the right hardware , on a re@@ working of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical assignment ( manual ) and last about manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there is a few that work with GPS receivers simultaneously . either as card module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
the GPS data from a device can be done by g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel . you need to save these data in the G@@ P@@ X format , as it is the only format supported by the module for ge@@ ographic assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS to extract and cor@@ related data from images and on the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the length - and string grade or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs described by map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; tries to give you as much control of his work processes , as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ ous ; click on these settings . the Settings dialog is set into eight pages . you can switch between these changes by clicking on the symbols of the left .
this promotion can be displayed on single @-@ embedded preview or image processing . you can put the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ ous ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main picture .
this page contains , as shown below , the standard did@@ acy and copyright data . these data is written automatically in the respective IP@@ TC data fields . also in case of database synchron@@ ization , these data will be written in the IP@@ TC fields .
Aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for author . this field should contain the career drawing of the photographer . this can be certain drawings such as drivers photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a further description for the car field , this is also to be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for provider : use this field to indicate the picture . this must not be the author , if it is a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press ; if the picture is a camp photo , then the group or agency will be listed here .
the IP@@ TC @-@ actions save data to the respective IP@@ TC rim . this is achieved that the met@@ ad@@ ata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ ous ; these met@@ ad@@ ata can also be imported and imported into &amp; digi@@ ous ; imported without lost .
save image quality as embedded label ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can be read in pictures of other images . attention : with images that are already lab@@ eled by the sign &amp; digi@@ ous ;
the page Settings contains all the options that appear if the mouse has rest in the main window over a file . depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ous ; supports a number of different image formats and several video and audio formats ; to determine which file types &amp; digi@@ came ; edit , you can add the file extension to this list , which has not added any of these extensions ; it is ig@@ no@@ red by &amp; digi@@ ous ;
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Update from each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ ance of &amp; digi@@ ous ; can be set on this page on the default values . however , if you are switched on the lights . however , the option &amp; quot ; In the whole picture size , you should only use easier computers . if you have one , then you can get better picture results .
by default the image processing has a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer another color , you can select this here . you can switch the tool bar when you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or light colour in the picture . these colors are set here . in the picture the picture can be switched between F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and switched off .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images are encoded at a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance as in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia to the next explanation .
with the P@@ NG @-@ compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG @-@ files . this operation reduces the image data more time to spin and un@@ pack . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to a high compression . therefore means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression ratio .
with the option TIFF files , you can comp@@ ress the De@@ fl@@ ate -@@ compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it does not have influence on the image quality , since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm works fun .
with the loss @-@ loss JPEG 2000 files , you can save fun @-@ free . even if you have the loss of loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was not yet supported , met@@ ad@@ ata were not yet supported , but was in planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ ous , the image processing was only a picture @-@ viewed for photos . currently , it is very fast to manip@@ ulation your photos . with this dialogue , you can change the settings of the image processing .
the standard rate is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light , when using this option , this distinction creates a bit soft , elimin@@ ates this option with a minimum loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 lat@@ tice patterns with V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance is used in the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed paint machine that was photograph@@ ed on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed photos in four steps more detail in the top @-@ lights . for other cameras this option is ig@@ no@@ red .
the standard is the nickn@@ ame , so that the parts of your images are embedded in the settings , as continuous white in the settings . the setting colors are produced , as they generate a few unusual results in different ro@@ at@@ ons . at least you can try some parts of missing information from the con@@ test@@ ers .
this is possible because blue pixels in general is not as fast satur@@ ated as green and red . &amp; they try to re@@ design the missing green and red shares from the still not satisfied blue pixels . of course , this is a question , how much color or white you want .
if you select the option , you will get the possibility to set a level . here &apos;s a value of three compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each image .
put the L@@ umin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to set him somewhat higher than the default 1 . however , this may also be used in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; -@@ image processing . to keep the time for the demo@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should be conservative .
an demo@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial image sensor that provides many cameras and the one matrix color pixel . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; and D@@ Cra@@ w set you three alternatives at your disposal : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm created by D@@ Cra@@ w . however , it produces color facts on the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with acceptable results .
if you know the colour gra@@ pe of your l@@ ent@@ ils , you can put the red and blue correc@@ tions here . this is certainly the best method for a color of soft correction , as you are performed during the pipe conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions as it should be given . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ ous ; information about color information from a colour space in the other , so that colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Issu@@ es if a picture is opened in picture @-@ processing / color management module will start with raw files .
color Profile Fol@@ der click here the folder such as / us@@ r / share / dev / ICC or / home / user / user / user / user / users / ICC , where you can store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ ous ; this folder was investigated during the Star@@ ts .
settings of the ICC profiles you have the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profile . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color administration view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here only your pictures are not managed to the entire screen .
the input profile should fit to the camera manufacturers and model that you can use . not all profiles are contained in the same way . currently , the cra@@ b Gamma does not contain any color mapping or gam@@ ma@@ correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma does not need to carry out converters at 16 bits of depth . this means that you need to carry the color mapping itself .
there are further options like the soft @-@ pro@@ of @-@ profile , with which you can em@@ ulate a picture of one device . this is very useful before you can print image , as your printer can work a smaller color than your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated , instead of looking forward to the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is fairly obviously what colour profile for them are intended for them . unfortunately , there is no table of cameras and profiles together with the models of Canon . this answer is of course un@@ official :
the Canon Pro@@ files can recognize the style for the destination : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for portrait , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface supported by a series of &amp; K@@ DE ; image scans and image processing is supported ; many modules support , which are written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can see a list of the available modules . choose out of which you want to use , and these modules will be uploaded as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you can also see some of the text context menu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; short command for tasks that can be carried out of modules can set up in the menu under settings short command . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules you can get through the K@@ IP@@ I project at h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the Di@@ ash@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ b adjust the time between the image cross@@ ings , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check@@ boxes switches the met@@ ad@@ ata or out , which are embedded at the bottom end of the images during the display .
camera features show on the left side a list of all cameras supported . on the right side there is a button automatic detection , which tries to make sure that the camera is connected properly , switched on and in image display mode . there are currently default , USB@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire @-@ Mass memory .
at the bottom end you can put the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage camera . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage camera from the camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera / m@@ nt / s , specify at which you hang your camera .
to use &amp; digi@@ plug your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you have to connect the camera to your computer , and turn it in the display mode .
try out whether &amp; digi@@ ous ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually after you have set up your camera , your camera appears in the menu camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this will be displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert more than one camera .
with the option Open dialog for the move of &gt; Pictures in the tr@@ ash@@ ings , you can set the discussions of &amp; digi@@ ous ; when del@@ eting a photos into an album . in the c@@ utt@@ ings of a photos and del@@ etion of a album , you will find further details .
the editorial changes caused by the right side bar can be dis@@ closed through &amp; digi@@ ous ; if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any feedback . otherwise , you have to save changes with the button changes .
you can also sign the display of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ ous ; starting to start . this will accelerate the starting operation of &amp; digi@@ ous ; .
the attitude of Bei@@ m to new photos are comp@@ elled &amp; digi@@ ous albums / photos . this extends the starting time of &amp; digi@@ ous albums . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the starting time of &amp; digi@@ ous ; if something from the base folder was deleted , asks &amp; digi@@ ous ; you ask whether it should delete this from the database .
various color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ plug ; in order to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can select the settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in a new design for &amp; digi@@ ous ; you will find further information about this tutorial in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ came ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use this to view your photos and improve the image processing menu on the preview of a picture or select the context menu of preview and Edit menu / Edit menu .
the image processing includes a range of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ ous ; so you are not part of your distribution . more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the photo editing section .
a Status Bar at the bottom edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge and among them the tool bar for quick access to the most common functions .
the processing functions of image processing change your photos . however , the original photo will alter , before you have used the original photo or use the button Save from the tool bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you should update a copy of your image before you change it . this can save you to store Save as possible .
as long as you have not saved the picture , you can restore the original image by using the File Recovery button or restore the button Rest@@ ore restore the image editing in the tool bar . you then lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last store .
almost any action of image processing can be re@@ vo@@ iced or recovered . the last action can be re@@ vo@@ iced by adding editing re@@ vo@@ cal or re @-@ manufactured by editing the Edit menu .
if you often use this , the keyboard ab@@ brevi@@ ation , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z can turn back and re@@ produce C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z for re@@ produce .
if you prefer the &amp; L@@ MB ; over the back @-@ up or restore button in the tool@@ bar at the moment you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all the actions will be processed and recovered .
once you start the picture , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by clicking the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image below or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes at the latest photo , you are asked if you want to store it .
you can put in the photo in which you get C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the call menu .
in order to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool bar : magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full Screen Mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view that you would like to use the Es@@ c button . if you don &apos;t like this , you can call this in the Settings dialog box . see the main window . see the section for setting up the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print image and print the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; print dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or full sentences . all images can choose from your selection . you will only select the pictures with the default methods and choose from the menu album Export Printer . if you follow the assistant , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; the main window has a side bar at the right edge , which is important information and actions for selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation line , even in the image processing . it is displayed if one of the five riders is clicked on :
multiple click on the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear and disappear again into the edge .
in the label view , you can add labels with unlimited size or insert . note that the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . that means all special characters are allowed to be used in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - Fields , so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated up and special characters are formed after 2000 characters . if you wish to use the IP@@ TC labelling in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after which you have commented it either , use either the button user or change to the next picture , which will be saved then .
besides the user button there is a button More . with this , you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or database . however , this is always done if you have selected the met@@ ad@@ ata setting , which is always written into the pictures .
the section evaluation shows a evaluation scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting lines . it can only be applied to the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard ab@@ brevi@@ ation . to rate multiple images at the same time , select this from and use the context menu .
the assessment will be written in the IP@@ TC field . coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the key@@ word shows a search box for the words of keywords , the sample tree and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; digi@@ ous ; session of the sample .
the key@@ word is dynam@@ ically adapted to the given search word . you can quickly limit the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further improvement in the input of sample in a picture series . if you have entered different search words , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check@@ boxes in the tree . the key words of a image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if several pictures are selected in the main screen , and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want to add a selection with a key@@ word , please read the sample filter .
the key@@ note filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar with their album , - data , sample and search results are used , only the cut quantity of these two are displayed . all search words are available .
you can also drag and drop several pictures in the main view . if the key@@ word exists already , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears if you want to set the key@@ word .
in the upper example the main window shows the pictures at one calendar day . the sample filter has been selected on one calendar . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a key@@ word from the right hand @-@ tree was put into the selection and put it there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes will take place at any start of the program . it can also be switched off under the settings .
if you have a rule with and created and determine that it &apos;s a or should be , you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry , searching in the database . this may be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string , which is already set in the database .
for example , you can define a Extended search over all the elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options will see as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r are not listed ? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly met &amp; digi@@ ous ; s concrete implementation was adapted .
the reason why a color@@ fully @-@ managed workflow is a predic@@ table vari@@ ability of which actually photograph@@ ed or fed colors . with a color@@ fully workflow , you can reach the colors on your monitor from your camera or scanner and the colors that you want to print or publish the colors of your digital dark chamber .
if the theme is coming on color management , everyone wants to press how to press buttons for the results . unfortunately , colour management means to provide you sufficient background information about color administration . in addition , links with lower information will help you meet your own informative decisions .
if your image work@@ flows all six below criteria must be fulfilled , then you don &apos;t worry about color management .
you are calibr@@ ated on a monitor which is calibr@@ ated to the high RGB color space . ( further information see below )
your only other image expend@@ itu@@ res are per e @-@ mail or the web , where the RGB of de @-@ fac@@ to is standard .
so if , RGB so well works and the life for all so easy , why should you use another color space and make your thoughts about paint spray n@@ g ?
a visual example of the Lim@@ itation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we really can see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ ni@@ zed region , and the colors in the RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color flowers , so you can visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms page and click on information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to al@@ ise my monitor when I decided to work only in the RGB color space ?
Yes ! if you are working in the s@@ RGB color space or not , you need to switch to your monitor the circle . if you &apos;re working as the color space of s@@ RGB , you have to use either your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard c@@ alli@@ bri@@ eren , using a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual processing .
the features norm@@ alize , un@@ equal , automatic up@@ loading and contrast from the menu correct Automatic correction will try to make the best choice of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects , to see what &apos;s best in your photo .
norm@@ alize the controls : this method is scalable to the entire image , so that the dark point is black and the brigh@@ test point as it is possible without changing the color . this function frequently is a magnetic correction for images that are dark or balanced .
like this method , this method adjusted the light factor of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity is as flat as possible . sometimes , the same very good results achieved in the improvement of the image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that causes a wonder at a picture or it was destroyed .
automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determin@@ es the dark and bright border tones and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ ar area .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of a picture by the lowest and highest values of all values in between . this is only visible at balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ ous ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the white balance of a photos .
the white balance correction is slightly restricted because of a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can easily carry out the white surface in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your possibilities will drop to correction .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm created by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ on . they start the menu entry colors white down the image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand , both the original image as well as the preview of the target image are adapted . if you want to see the original wh@@ it@@ ish again , then click on the sub@@ windows .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is shown as vertical line at the hist@@ ogram .
right above is a hist@@ ogram , that once you change a parameter , once you have a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very useful , even in well lit images , most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is called .
the contrast of your result depends on sh@@ adows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the sh@@ adows adjust the sh@@ ading rails of your photos or even down dim@@ ms .
with the above @-@ mentioned checks , you should use the colour temperature pip@@ ette . press this button and afterwards somewhere on the image preview for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of the white balance . on this type , the temperature and green values are automatically set .
additionally , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ flow indicator increases the colors if more than a color channel of the Pix@@ els is over@@ exposed .. you will display the combined result in white colour . this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons saving as well as loading make this . any adjustment of the white balance you have set you to store it in a text file and re@@ load later .
the button pre@@ ferences supports all filter values again to their standard values and the associated neutr@@ als . note that also neutral settings will be displayed as your original . if you store this , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the co@@ dic@@ ation depth per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high quality images . this coding requires more plate , calcul@@ ating time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool gives the same dialogue like the processing of raw images . it uses the change and as@@ signing colour profiles . colour ton@@ holes can be carried out by the sub@@ windows to the brightness . a detailed manual for the use of colour profiles can be made to the chapter of color management .
another important tool is available in the menu under colors . this tool provides an integrated way to save several color channels simultaneously , so that you can always use it for several photos . this is useful if your camera or your scanner will always require the same error , and you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool at Gra@@ dation , that you can find a gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool color effects gives you four color effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , an ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , solar mer@@ isation , also Sab@@ ati@@ er , also known as a partial pressure of the image . this was the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas of dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted . the result was a partial neg@@ atively of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar polar@@ ization . at approx . 50 % intensity shows the image what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase will eventually create a negative image that is so not on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar @-@ effect effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the treated intensity ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from the satur@@ ation that it makes a stronger contra@@ sting effect that makes the colours brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easy to emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the market name for an optimized colour film produced by Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colors are also some phot@@ ograph@@ ers , especially those who are hardly able to date landscapes .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light on the contra@@ sts . the parameter level controls the brightness of the results and the shooting repet@@ itions the strength of Ne@@ on@@ light . in large images the filter can load the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual to correct the color con@@ cre@@ st and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . all your alignment can be pleased with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result , you can use the button O@@ k and you are used .
if you have a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the converted problem : too much satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool is able to increase the satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . all the changes you can perform in preview . if Him do you like the result , you can confirm the changes using O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple leu@@ k@@ ic / contrast / Gamma , the tool is extremely complicated . even if the dialogue to this tool is very complicated , you need for the application purposes only the area of the sli@@ der . concrete the three sli@@ der below the hist@@ ogram @-@ program .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three sli@@ der can be moved in , to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright fields .
the eas@@ iest way to learn the operation is to move the kno@@ b and to consider it as the picture changes .
on the right side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated , based on the image settings . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this select box can be adjusted if the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis is frequently used . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram of a single column is dominated . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic sheet is useful .
three kno@@ b : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , commonly called Gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three twe@@ ez@@ ers can be used in the preview of the original image , in order to adjust the inputs of the shade , medium and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
out@@ set : the output value allow manual values for each area . there are also two kno@@ b to change the output value , e.g. , the compression of the output can be used , for example , to create an extremely easy picture as the background , while something else can be seen in the background .
automatically : in this button the image values will automatically be set automatically depending on the intensity of the image .
save as well as loading : using these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and re @-@ loaded later . the Gim@@ p level is used again .
if you are using these mode and use three color@@ im@@ ets , the input will automatically be adjusted to all sh@@ adows , means and sun tones . please click the preview of the original image for Rot@@ or , Green , Blue and L@@ umin@@ ance channels .
the option over@@ flow indicator controls all colour channels to view over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined results of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final result .
below is an example of the alignment of the procedure applied to red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynam@@ ically modified in dependence on your settings . on the right side , the following options are available :
Modification channel : this selection box allows to set the channel be changed from the module :
in addition to this box , two symbols are located between a linear and log@@ arith@@ m@@ ical view . for pictures taken with a digital camera , the linear mode of a constant colour creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps in this case .
for example , if you post@@ p@@ one a we@@ dge to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones can be correspon@@ ded with dark sayings and associated with the corresponding image pixels .
on the preview of the original photos is a red marking . if you want to change this marking on the area you want to change the original value . create a point on this line and move it to and off until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as well as loading : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any turn that you can create in the file system saved and later loaded . the file format is the Gim@@ p spa format .
if you want to create this method and the three color@@ im@@ ets buttons automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , medium and sun tones . if you want to use the color , click on the original screen to set control points for the rotor , green , blu@@ epr@@ int and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option c@@ ens@@ es@@ cal@@ ator controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that has been corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shot and sun sound has been put on the curves and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the correct ( 2 ) .
the channel Mi@@ xer of the &amp; digi@@ came ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the shades of the photos .
the channel Mi@@ xer is another highly developed tool around the colours of the pictures . you can process it from the menu colors Channel Mi@@ xer of the Image Processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first Note how to correct the channels by using the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left area of the window shows you a preview of . the original can be viewed compared to your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mar@@ kers . if you place this in the picture a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right below : controller for red , green and construction allows you to mix these channels . if you are also able to keep the appropriate colour components , as the channel Mi@@ xer is used to reduce the creation of great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a colour in a visible noise that comes from colour space , which is not shown at the same place in color channel , and whose noise is not unlike any channel . if that &apos;s the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion as a result in which you need to reduce the far@@ thing first .
the store as well as loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any Mi@@ xer setting can be saved and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option over@@ flow indicator controls all colour channels to view over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined results of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re @-@ adjusted . the original image is activated under ( 1 ) and the working image below ( 2 ) .
black / white @-@ photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a step step , as colour images can be converted to the computer . also with a set of movie roller profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scenarios and fits particularly good to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
orange image : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , marine scenes and air photos . similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) orange image .
rotary filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dram@@ atically cel@@ ion@@ effects and can sim@@ ulate a mo@@ on@@ set of the day time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ ate filter .
yellow filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow liner filter . this is the most natural color correction , and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ p@@ on : this creates warm light and medium tones . this is very similar to the process of exter@@ mination of an printer and recovery in a Sep@@ tic . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures on an image .
by adding a texture to your picture , regardless of whether it is a color screen or not , you can look it like a painting of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a wall image on a wall . the menu entry image texture can be used for it .
relief : post@@ p@@ one this parameter to the right , the depth of the deep or three @-@ dimensional texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tual effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image has been shown ( 1 ) and changed ( 2 ) . the relief is set to 200 .
using the &amp; digi@@ plug ; the frame can add a decorative frame to be added to a picture .
the eye of an argument to keep the bound@@ aries of a photos is not easy task . an opportunity to keep his attention is to put an decorative frame . this is a psychological Bar@@ barrier to the moving eye . under the frame you can add the module from the image processing .
type : with this parameter , you set the desired frame type for your picture . immediately converted the image with a thin frame and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , it is ideal for a decorative three @-@ dimensional frame and decor@@ atively adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited by 1 % to 50 % .
this is bigger than the original finish line will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the printing of the pictures , especially if you have used the tool Fol@@ ders .
with this practical tool , you can attach easy @-@ to @-@ format text in a picture at any place . this will also work in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text area , orientation , color from the colour space and the character set with his features like you need . at the end you can simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background . the image is finished .
each setting which you have chosen for your text can be changed until you have saved on the button &quot; OK &quot; . after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed .
using the digi@@ plug ; tool St@@ en@@ cil allows you to put a template over a picture .
the menu picture templates apply in image processing can be used to create templates over a picture .
for templates there are no restrictions concerning the size and orientation . you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should add your template of the &amp; digi@@ ous file ; you simply send a email to the &amp; digi@@ ous file ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ ous @-@ Users @ k@@ de.@@ org ..
if you use this tool for first time , you need to put your sten@@ cil folder with the button base folder in a dialog . choose the folder where you have to retri@@ eve the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder for templates has been set to a building that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil . selection of a folder will be updated automatically .
under the preview you will find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
Enlarge : this button increases the following image . it is cent@@ ered around the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller : this button resi@@ zed the below picture below . it is cent@@ ered around the mouse . if you want to use the template on the whole picture , you &apos;ll need to sc@@ roll the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to use the template on your picture . the picture will then be adjusted automatically .
&amp; digi@@ came ; three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has privileg@@ es in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ es is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but creates particularly in dark areas , gra@@ dient pictures .
Un@@ shar@@ k mask is working on the contrast of the edges to look like a painting . indeed , it is not a bit more psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by copyright of Win@@ ston Chang .
it is possibly the best of the three , because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it &apos;s a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt .
photos without focus and most digit@@ alised images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is that the same phenomenon must be summar@@ ised as the resolution . the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points will be printed on paper . SLR cameras usually need more subsequently shar@@ pen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
JPEG pictures often has been used to use internal sharp@@ ness . images in the shell format , however , have to always be off@@ ended in the processing .
some scanner apply a sharp@@ ness filter during the reading of the image . if you de@@ activate this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get usable results by simply shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing score . you can correct shar@@ pen@@ ing with the menu entry .
you should c@@ auti@@ ously deal with this , as the results are not very natural , the sharp@@ ness increase the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , you can learn more information about the menu entry . under Re@@ fo@@ gen you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too tight . the solution , the image a little soft , is much easier than it . use the tool for soft@@ ness correct and try something with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove veil@@ s from your photos . a demonstration can see here .
the original image and preview can help the image . the preview window shows the image of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tested first . an increase of the radius or the amount ampli@@ fy the effect . if you produce the un@@ sharp@@ ness mask , noise and impression of gr@@ ats in the vicinity of sharp edges .
the radius will feature a lot of pixels on each side of a edge through the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen images at best in its final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the illustrated picture one of the original . therefore , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the sw@@ elling is a fra@@ ction from the maximum RGB value and the difference @-@ amount . you can define a minimum difference to this way for an edge of the filter . in this way areas are avoided between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ alties and therefore avoided errors in faces , Himm@@ ler and water surface .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp mask filters . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the painted picture is applied ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king was applied with a radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; the focus focused on a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright of the protected de@@ alt@@ ation filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool is trying a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ us@@ ability . this is better than try to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique named F@@ IR Vien@@ nese Fil@@ ming . it can usually start better results as un@@ sharp mask . you can start from the menu by using colors Re@@ focus on the image processing .
in practice , the circular f@@ lap works much better than the Gau@@ ge &apos;s f@@ lap , which leads to the mathematical outcome as well . the F@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ge &apos;s F@@ itting is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels . the causes un@@ wanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular area . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images , the default value should set 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image should be extremely bl@@ ur@@ red , but then on sanctuary .
correlation : an increase of correlation can help to reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation is reduced the sharp@@ ly effect of the module .
noise filters : an increase of the room filter can help you . the filter can accept values of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0,1 is very bad . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 is the image quality very bad . a good value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value is still further contamination .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases you should use this value to 0 , in most cases you should use this value to 0 , so you may need to increase the correlation and / o@@ der@@ ate filter .
mat size : this value specifies the size of transformation matrix . a increase of mat size can produce good results , especially if you choose great values for the circular flow or the Gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any arbitr@@ ary parameters will be set to you for later and then can be loaded later .
try all the cuts , colour and intensity applications on the picture before you use the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much sur@@ geri@@ es changes that not immediately visible , but later left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read pictures and compressed , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ ks produces better results as shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mas@@ ks in a major neighborhood as shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically it has to create un@@ sharp mas@@ ks always . even under optimum conditions it can never indicate the effect of the im@@ sharp@@ ness . it is practically the result of the F@@ IR Vien@@ nese Fil@@ ters always just as good as the Un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ance M@@ ask . the F@@ IR Wiener Filter is often better than the processing of small details .
below , you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture , see :
the original un@@ sharp colour screen has to be corrected . this picture has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due on un@@ sufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information about the methodology of shar@@ pen@@ ance structure in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the regulator Gl@@ amping puts the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ance of the range of dar@@ ken@@ ing in order to generate a natural P@@ up@@ ille .
the color tin@@ ted allows a adapted paint for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool picture error correction is one of the most developed tool , in order to remove the desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ side algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different default settings as a starting point to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available default settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the rider smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detailed maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a small value leads to a smooth glass deposit and details sharp . a value of 0.9 should be found so that no shar@@ pen@@ ance is necessary . please note that the detailed rules should always be sub@@ ordin@@ ate to the direction of the direction .
direction dependence of alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value sm@@ ooth@@ es evenly into all directions , while a value is located close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a high value of similar pattern . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te will be best fixed at a value near 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor via all@@ es@@ . p then define the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , set this value to the degree of space in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the greater amount is set , the more is sm@@ ooth@@ ed . this is necessary if it is difficult to create geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : can be done as often the algorithm . usually lasts 1 or 2 .
angle step width since &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha small is selected , it should also be small , so that small angles can create a long runtime . so , you should select this value as maximum possible and acceptable for your needs .
integr@@ ating stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integr@@ ating st@@ ep@@ per in pixels . you should use the value small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing , and never larger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more on quality which you will receive by selecting this option is just small . it doubles the duration . we therefore recommend it to allow him .
the buttons Save as well as loading make this . any setting of image errors can be stored in a text file and re @-@ loaded later .
image error correction is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take very long and pull a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button shut@@ down .
below you can see how picture error was removed with little ar@@ te@@ facts . the module will be applied on a photo that in Guatemala city has been used with an analogue camera that caused by a bad film storage during the journey . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a protected property algorithm by Peter Heck@@ el .
this tool provides selectable image filter to remove st@@ ains and other ar@@ te@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens can be removed too . it can also be used to remove sens@@ es from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ ty ; effects of pic@@ tured images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensors of digital cameras , you can read this tutorial in this tutorial .
the screenshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a grain size that can be removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ windows details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain in the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . great values increase the time specified by the filter , and the color is moved about the picture and the color in it is sm@@ ooth@@ ed and so that smaller flaws were adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : adjust@@ s the sharp@@ ness to adjust the filter into the front of the filter . if it is increased , you may change the edges . if the value is high , the adap@@ tive filter details cannot be adjusted anymore , the adap@@ tive filter details can no longer receive and noise or dirt .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . if it is too strong , the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , you can easily remove the whole noise or noise peaks . set it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG ar@@ te@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance ent@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . we recommend either color or light density to improve a picture . these settings can not affect the smoo@@ thing process through the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or light density to improve a picture . these settings can not affect the smoo@@ thing process through the details settings .
Gamma : controls the G@@ amm@@ at@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker ranges which are typically stronger , but poll@@ uted the sh@@ atten@@ ds .
shock absorption : controls the adjustment of the Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ ing absorption . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of lumin@@ ance . when he is high , appear on the edges , noise and Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter appear on the edges . it can remove space @-@ sharp and is the recommended method for this .
save under and loading : these buttons are used exactly . all parameters for the noise reduction which you have set , can be saved in the file system and later loaded .
this is an example of how the noise reduction of your life can change . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and correct with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied to the default settings .
sometimes a painting for your purpose . the solution , a little soft to draw , is fortunately much easier than a picture with the menu entry and experiment with the menu . the preview window shows the effect of this operation to your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools by photo ar@@ te@@ facts .
this filter to restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of wanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to immer@@ se Gau@@ ge &apos;s noise , cr@@ ushing , compression , compression , compression and local mist@@ akes . the smoo@@ thing is done along the image con@@ tours and gives the content as it gives the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for colour and tex@@ tual errors . the tex@@ tual operation is carried out with another tool , which was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / fran@@ chis@@ el and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss@@ less compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are un@@ compressed in un@@ compressed image . this setting is intended to correct this problem .
the buttons store as well as loading make this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved and re @-@ loaded later .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take very long and pull a high CPU load after itself . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can reduce like a photo with equ@@ ine noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO was taken . you can recognize the not@@ ori@@ ous film grain on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and correct under ( 2 ) .
below , you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures will be applied to an old colour photo taken with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts and the photo paper . the original image can be seen under ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows the hot@@ pixel of photos that have been used with a CCD camera to remove eight . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project that are protected by Martin Dick@@ p .
bright , dead or hot pixels are particularly with high @-@ quality raw material photos , because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel clock ; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the assist@@ ants with the button dar@@ ken@@ ess . the tool will recognize automatic the hot and bright pixels . these will be highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it &apos;s important that you can record the dark image directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark image to the correct picture . an automatic processing of the dark image will see the bad pixels . please note that the assistant to see the last dark image and re@@ load this automatically in the next meeting .
the image area and preview can help you within the picture the result correct . the preview window shows the issue of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all fields of view .
choose a area to preview the defective pixels on preview and the results of the Fil@@ ters . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate this pixel blocks . these are the following filters available :
Dur@@ ation : it will be an average of the neighbouring pixel . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 pixel , are used for calcul@@ ating a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ D@@ im ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ D@@ im ) , and then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixel are used to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ D@@ im ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ D@@ im ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixel in the block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are used to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ D@@ im ) or a group of Cuban curves ( 1 @-@ D@@ im ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel @-@ correction on a colour photo , from a defective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous correction ; vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. , exposed corners to correct a image .
wide angle lens , especially those in the medium and large photo format , you can not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting @-@ . instead . ( sh@@ ady ) it reaches the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that can reach the sensor there . tel@@ e@@ objective clearly show this behavior .
but he also has dis@@ advantages . many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 when the aperture filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should also use , also with center filters , a opening of f / 16 or smaller because otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen@@ sive movement are created .
using the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and color scanner , digital cameras and film Scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter , which is done without these filters , the transformation of a C@@ enter@@ filter should be applied to an image . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three ra@@ fts , you can control the vig@@ net@@ ization correction filter and check three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of luminous intensity at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , equivalent to an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly to compens@@ ate a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ization , reduce the density by a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting .
leu@@ k@@ starch , contrast and Gamma @-@ Settings : the editing of the image with the Vig@@ net@@ ization correction is reducing the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target with these options . the regulator must only increase positive values , as you need to increase the settings .
if you want a more fine tuning of the target image , so let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing from the menu Color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction of a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ tes in corners and ( 2 ) correct image . a leu@@ k@@ iller and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; lens cut@@ off is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses in photos . it uses a protected property algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool operates with geomet@@ ric distortion . coloured distortion is not corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree is the general geomet@@ rical distortion of lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ vex form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circuit effect , but flat on the edges . this correction will not be applied in the tool .
the coefficient of the arrow corrected the remote corners to the second degree . if you combine these two geomet@@ rical distortion is almost eliminated .
General : this value controls the strength of the distortion part of the distortion . with negative values , gra@@ dients can be corrected and positive values of the distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth degree . this value is stronger than the edges in the middle of the picture . most of the l@@ ent@@ ils has the &quot; corners &quot; of the parameter of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and performs a correction of the first gra@@ dient . negative values increase while positive the image will be smaller .
brigh@@ ter : this value adjusted the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase .
in order to help you the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview the distortion correction . the values that you use for your image are saved and used as standard values .
the tonn@@ age or c@@ ienti@@ al correction should be carried out before any in@@ cutting or size changes . best , you make this correction as all first . if you need a picture to re @-@ cut and then perform a fra@@ ction correction might be the effect of the fal@@ sely .
in order to help you the best correction will provide you to view this tool a vertical and horizontal relief line . move it into an important place , like e.g. the sea level or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . in connection , you can correct the gra@@ ins / c@@ ienti@@ al distortion with the help of the lines .
when you correct a pic@@ kl@@ ed distortion , the resulting image will have black edges . you can remove this with the slic@@ ing tool in the menu transformation from the image processing or via the zoom regulator of this dialogue .
for most images the tin @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step is for some pictures of the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective so correct that all angles in the picture 90 degrees have . note that when you have the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective .
this is an example of the tonn@@ age correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ cu@@ cum@@ i.@@ org website . the filter re@@ produces Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
on the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
under the preview you can sim@@ ulate two parameters for film grain and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . if you sim@@ ulate the gra@@ dient texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller changed the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter color channels are mixed to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it not to apply the effect on black / white photos because the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ me@@ ek@@ tes used on a landscape photo of New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the extended picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of A@@ ura in the nickn@@ ame .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter volume is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film @-@ speed fil@@ ms such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the movies , the manufacturer big silver gra@@ ins of phot@@ emul@@ sion .
the film volume effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets rid of daily life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , you have to use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to the intensity of intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the body . the default value is , although often higher values need to be set to ISO 2400 . if you still need more baskets , you can use the filter repeatedly .
this is an example of film @-@ gra@@ ding effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice look like a oil painting . natural pictures and styles are good for this effect .
there are two kno@@ bs in order to influence this effect . the upper elec@@ ts the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brush are better suitable for large images . smoo@@ thing the smoo@@ thing or , from the other side , consider the hing@@ es .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the box is marked with the ( 2 ) . pin@@ out size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and glasses 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a cab@@ bage burning . images whose gra@@ dients vary slowly . therefore it is helpful to imagine that scene you would have voted to match you . this would be good pictures to start .
there are two kno@@ b with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper kno@@ b elec@@ ts the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast ( glass deposit ) .
this is an example of the carbon filter filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Filter engraving forms your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a protected property algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; Filter engraving is a fast tool to return your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works very good in pictures with a simple structure . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to trans@@ form the image in a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ed landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can trans@@ form a normal photo into an artwork by distor@@ ted effects . it uses copyright algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave height 1 : divi@@ des the picture in cells and look it as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave height 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 the image is distor@@ ted here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can stop this effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group you can trans@@ form a normal photo in an artwork by un@@ sharp@@ ness effects . it uses copyright algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ shar@@ k : wi@@ pes the picture along the cardboard lines . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ k camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radi@@ al un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image by rotation of the pixel by a focal point . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ sharp@@ ness of a turning camera .
distance of distance : wi@@ pes the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera se . the object seems to come back in the background .
movement of motion : wi@@ pes the picture through horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ sharp@@ ly linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera .
turn@@ out Un@@ shar@@ k : wi@@ pes the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ aming and shiny focus effect ( Hamilton Effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour @-@ photos or add a warm and sub@@ tle bulbs .
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ egraph : wi@@ ped the picture by acci@@ dental shift of pixels and sim@@ ulates the un@@ sharp@@ ly moving camera .
intelligent un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ance : the colour is shown in the picture and wi@@ pes these without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it to the col@@ t with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation always with the button .
the shelves are a nice small tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your image . this gives it natural your images a great look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected by legally protected algorithm .
dri@@ pping size allows to change the size of the drops . since the dri@@ pping size is not automatically increasing with the size of the image . number changes the number and density of drops . fish stocks changes the optical effect of drop in the image .
you can hold with &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing a range of rain drops . do not use the range of tools in order to stay free of charge . if you start the filter reg@@ ains , the area will remain free from rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the reg@@ im@@ rop@@ es Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the painted picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu transform@@ ations and transformation mirror .
photo bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most developed tools in order to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to be smaller is simple . the big question is , how can you cut a picture below and keep the details sharp ? how can you find out a picture or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm is used here , make sure a good work . try him and you will see it yourself .
if a photo set the wrong size , you can alter it on the desired size with the tool size . choose a size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog box is shown below .
the tool for size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to burn the pixels of inter@@ pol@@ ation . if you want to increase the pixel image with a better quality , then try the tool for infl@@ ating .
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to increase the image . &amp; digi@@ ous ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to say the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider new size and are listed below :
keeping aspect ratio maintained : if this setting is activated , the original size of the original size is retained on the input of the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the greater amount is set , the more is sm@@ ooth@@ ed . this is necessary if it is difficult to create geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons Save as well as charging are used exactly . each entry for photo can be saved as text file saved and later loaded again .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it makes it , but it can still be very long and a high CPU load after itself . you can stop the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see an example of photo shooting by a small color image to double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication .
the cutting of a photo is not only a commonly performed surgery , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . in order to cut a photo you only need the rectangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pull off the rectangle , you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse .
if you move the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . thereby , you can change a good overview as your photo . you can move the size of the rectangle to cut off the corners of the rectangle , simply produce a new rectangle using the left mouse button .
as soon as you are satisfied with the cutting edge , use the button &quot; Cut@@ ting button pl@@ unge in the tool bar and the photo is tail@@ ored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or Save In the File menu to save the newly designed foto .
in the preview area you can change the size of the rectangle by re@@ loc@@ ating the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you have defined in dialogue , will remain in the dialog .
in the tool Fol@@ lowing the aspect ratio you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or trans@@ verse format . in the high @-@ format , the larger value of the height and in the landscape format is assigned .
the tool Fol@@ ders the aspect ratio uses a unique aspect ratio . that means it is always equal to whether you can use cm , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there exist two buttons to adjust the selection automatically horizontal or vertically .
below in the dialog box you can use the Max . ratio button to cut the size of the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool In order to cut off the aspect ratio and store its settings , depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) , these settings are stored as default values in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the compositions help themselves together help you make up your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ious triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third @-@ re@@ ins , harmon@@ ic triangles are oriented toward the diagonal triangles in similar harmon@@ ic triangles .
golden center : the golden middle is a division that is on different natural growth pattern , such as the spiral of a N@@ aut@@ ilus shell or the bub@@ bles of a sun@@ flower . it dives in all possible things on which we feel beautiful .
the golden Division is the ir@@ r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used with the old Egyptians and Greeks , so when you used your temple and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you have your paintings , buildings , and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i eps . 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number is equal to 1 equal to 1 : 1,@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition is considered as visu@@ ally harmon@@ ious .
the golden middle represents liqu@@ e@@ fied relief lines when you have a picture , and they are listed below :
the Golden spiral is used to achieve good results for your photos . compared to the third stage , the golden spiral creates a smooth line of the eye on the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual river on this type .
a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden sp@@ ines . it should be something that the eye can move into the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this can simply be able to meet its task without the eye .
the Golden triangles are also directed from the above @-@ discussed golden spiral . in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles have no equ@@ al@@ izing triangles . diagonal to these lines can be dispos@@ ed of a static object of dynamic .
if you use gold triangles in order to create your frame , you will create a effect of professional phot@@ ograph@@ ers dynamic Sym@@ met@@ ry . try your image focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can not reach differently .
the options horizont@@ ally reflects and vertically mirror can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the button color you can put the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . on this type , you can adjust the color of your current picture .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture to any angle of any angle .
if you want a photo , then it &apos;s easy to keep the camera exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things are turned around an angle ; and you can easily fix it with the &amp; digi@@ ous image . choose Free Rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are given in degrees . you can reset the sli@@ der to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right side .
for your help , the module gives free rotation a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse in the picture show around the two lines . now you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have shot an image , you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to repair this is the function transformation from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the function automatic . choose one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option sm@@ ooth@@ es the image a little after the rotation . note the above @-@ above warning .
all per@@ formers are carried out by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be re@@ charged . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty parts that are created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty parts that are created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees along the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle right : shows the current angle in degrees along the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees along the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : shows the current angle in degrees along the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image will be slightly dirty . this effect is small but two adap@@ tations produce a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you set the perspective you &apos;ll get un@@ pleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . a possibility to transfer this is the picture with transformation from the image processing .
the tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and left the other part in the opposite direction . this is no rotation , the picture is distor@@ ted . with other words , a rectangle is turned into a parallel ram . you can start this module via transformation .
check your image by using the Horizont@@ al angle and the vertical angle . if you click pre@@ ferences , the angle is set to zero . a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target figure will appear on the right .
for your help , a vertical and horizontal line is completed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool set to adjust your image .
after which you have carried out the image will be a little bit wi@@ ped out . this effect usually is negli@@ gible , but two ch@@ ings generated twice as much cont@@ acting and therefore you should avoid this .
after crossing the image has un@@ pleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to remove this is the picture with transformation from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ came ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read image formats thus depend on your system and , in some cases such as these libraries have been comp@@ il@@ ized . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to process a large number of image formats with &amp; accessories .
due to this dependence of other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats on this site . but you will always find JPEG and TIFF ?
&amp; digi@@ came ; displays only files in formats to which is known . this happens on the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change the file in image editing . you can change this list of file extensions . see section configuration for further information .
almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select the format . a detailed description of these file formats you can find in Wikipedia , and supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression techniques to digital pictures . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data to more efficient manner .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there is better , gl@@ atter@@ e results as JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s can also be saved , if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw material format , you can read more about Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous &apos;s and Cambridge in colour very helpful instructions . you can find blank images in JPEG or TIFF with the Roh@@ im@@ print from &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can find further information about the use of modules with &amp; accessories ;
&amp; digi@@ came ; supports loading of cru@@ de images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ ous ; they will see more than 200 raw material formats . all cameras can see below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw materials used by &amp; digi@@ ous ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are often saved in the AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format ; it is not a film processing program and is therefore not used for film file . &amp; digi@@ came ; the &amp; K@@ DE ; settings for playback of movies will be used to play the program .

if you watch the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was very good , then you can perform the first four alignment aid with the module white down .
many tools you need the photo processing are in &amp; digi@@ ous ; included in your description here .
all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , turn@@ out , sound pressure , Re@@ fo@@ ster , un@@ sharp mas@@ ks , &amp; etc . . use a uniform di@@ alog@@ ical type that is used in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below see &amp; quot ; texture @-@ user quot ; in this dialog box :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current picture . on the left of it , five buttons allow the comparable mode of the area to change . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ lic@@ ate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied on the right of the selected preview range .
horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ate . the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview range .
vertical parts . the left area shows the original and the right to see the effect of the filter .
horizontal parts . the upper section shows the original and the lower than the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that can be switched on , to show over@@ - and under@@ stand@@ ings . the colors can be adapted in the general site of the general site .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse within the picture and click on the part of the image from which you want to preview it . preview in the left part of the dialogue is updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all setting up the last use of the module will be noted .
the side@@ bar features shows the essential information about selected image and is largely explic@@ able . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters on the shoot of the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when these are available .
this rider does an intuitive map search tool available on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ ature program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within this coordinates will be filtered and displayed . these sets of course these pictures G@@ eo @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is a editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit colour pal@@ ettes and to select colors and ren@@ ame colors .
the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; K@@ DE ; may either apply to the entire system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your personal folder for &amp; K@@ DE ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog box you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folder to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a colour .
it shows the color beside . the color is described under the pallet view . here you can also change the color name .
it can also be used to choose from . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor . then move the mouse with the left hand left mouse button .
if the check box is activated under the button color , the color is inserted from the colour plate at the cur@@ sor . the color is inserted either or over@@ write another ; depending on whether the mode has been selected . this mode can be set by adding the check box under the Bei@@ m cur@@ sor .
a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and insert .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in clip@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue , and an optional color name , followed by a two @-@ line signs , if a further color follows , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit .

picture Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
choose the images that you want to cor@@ related to the main window and call the menu . in order to load a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you need to download a track file with G@@ P@@ X file , you &apos;ll naturally have to upload the same time to the same places as the pictures of your camera .
when the file is loaded a automatic correlation . GPS trace data are recorded at GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted with GMT . this can be done with time zone . please insert here your camera time zone .
the setting for maximum time deviation is a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera @-@ time . lies the deviation among them will be merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from one place for pictures , you can edit the G@@ P@@ X file manually and add the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will be cor@@ related all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in min. can be used when you don &apos;t have any matching data . if you know that in reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can put this bound@@ aries here and then write the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ eren .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have a number of photos on the same place . since the dialogue is using a call for the next notice , you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the loc@@ ation can also be found with the displayed map and enlarge it . choose the corresponding region and enlarge si@@ e.@@ Run this always again by up to you have to be selected manually . the card can always be changed manually . the card can be changed from card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang up the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to add a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums than HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for HTML pages . the character set is encoded as UTF @-@ 8 to allow a best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders in which settings can be adjusted . the rider selection allows you to select all albums . the albums are not hierarch@@ ically displayed . with the three buttons on the right hand you can select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ schau and text of the text can appear in the HTML page .
the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each side . this rider is largely explic@@ able . if you click on a picture one page is created . if you click on a picture a new page is displayed on the picture . otherwise , the image will appear on the picture directly with your standard image , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , is shown
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery can be saved with all your corresponding images . select a folder on which you write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , who contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information is stored on your original pictures in the new pictures .
with other color depth , you can change the default color depth , which also influences the file size . all other settings are also explained .
the Rider View images allows you to watch some of the settings from the album tab for the preview pictures , that are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user to how far the action is . press to break down the process .
if the module produces the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can read the program messages to determine whether faul@@ ts during generation . the web browser will automatically start to display the preview of the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to connect the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and can be performed on them basic operations such as speed , zo@@ oming , or post@@ p@@ one . the viewer can be used with short @-@ pass and quick access to its functions .
after launching a picture by default in full screen mode , this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG L@@ oss@@ less module is a tool to alter images without com@@ promising your quality .
this module allows to store images in JPEG format , without the usual losses of quality and met@@ ad@@ ata .
the consequence of the loss@@ less storage is that the file size is rising because there is no compression of the color information . this can be found e.g. at P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ click is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ click currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the ma@@ iling list of K@@ IP@@ I Teams under K@@ DE @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. note : participants of this list speak English .

with the import function of the met@@ ad@@ ata modul@@ s , you can copy the data from a picture to another . then , you can copy the import dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so you can copy the met@@ ad@@ ata . the data will be copied to the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but not in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please check out ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG co@@ aster module is a tool to convert a set of images to a MPEG video in the form of a Di@@ ash@@ au .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can also be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the pack@@ ets for M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . between the single pictures you can add a base file in MP2 or WAV of Di@@ asch@@ au .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can create a background color for the Di@@ ash@@ au . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD to create DVD player . to burn the medium you finally can use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to use the pictures that are to be packed into the MPEG @-@ ash@@ au , then you can start using ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au to start the module .
the images selected by you are displayed under image files in the portfolio . you can also change the pictures or the contents of the list .
after you are happy with your list , you should select the other settings . the video format may be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . PAL is pre@@ set and most probably choose the right choice for Europe .
next step you should specify the time in seconds to specify a picture . the speed of the image is set below . a low value produces very sudden , high contrast with very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set up next . in doubt , you should set them black . in doubt , you can set the name and the path of the generated file you can design@@ ate the name of the MPEG @-@ output file .
if you have a audio file named in the name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the movie . after all settings , you can drink the generation of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can enjoy a coffee and enjoy the Di@@ ash@@ au when you back again .
if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the right settings .
the print assistant allows to print several pictures on a sheet paper in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is for example : make sense to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import your images stored in the RA@@ W format in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line m@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . an original file from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it generates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the RA@@ W file to convert and start the module . the Ra@@ w picture conversion window appears in the mode for a single picture . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings .
you can now adjust the values to optim@@ ise the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used . the key parameters such as Gamma , brightness and Red / Blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can process the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so you can use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera works in RGB mode the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame is equal to and just the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
tagged image format , TIFF , reserves all the information of your image and uses the loss@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
if you want to process your pictures often , or later , you should not use JPEG format , as it only allows a limited number of sur@@ geri@@ es before joining the image quality . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you want to select JPEG as memory format , the met@@ ad@@ ata files stored in the RA@@ W file are stored in the EX@@ IF file in the EX@@ IF information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start converting the conversion button . if you want to break this process , you can stop using this process .
the stack@@ ing processing mode allows you to convert various images to one time . use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single picture , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to automatically over@@ write the file . this is useful if they were produced in a previous attempt . a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of a album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the tim@@ est@@ amps .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . they can be smaller or enlarge the image of the image .
proportional ( 1 D@@ in . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the image will be selected automatically , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ in . ) : size change in two dimensions . this option remains unchanged . you can use this option to match your image to the screen format .
not propor@@ tionally : not propor@@ tion@@ ate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
printer preparation : prepar@@ es the picture for the photo pressure . the user can adjust the printing resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the added images in advance . further pictures can draw on the list of sending images and place there .
after you start the module , the pictures will be displayed with the selected images . you can add more images with a file selection dialog . for the last chosen picture , a preview of the right page is displayed .
you can also draw images on the list of images and add them to the list of sending images .
the selected pictures will be removed from the list of sending images from the list .
after you have selected all pictures , you can open the New Message @-@ windows of your e @-@ mail clients . you must only add the addresses and the subject . you have to add the images here as an app@@ endix .
don &apos;t pay attention to many pictures at one time . most e @-@ mail accounts are restrictions on the size of sending e @-@ mails . it is possible to send a good idea to send several emails if you want to send many images .
the e @-@ mail windows is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used every time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you &apos;ll need to specify the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must install the GM@@ O Agent on your computer . you can download this here .
after the selection of comments in an attached file , the comments are added to the images into a text file and added the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suited to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among the loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should not have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend to save the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under images file format and your original files in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ if@@ ted data will be added to send pictures .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically , in search of errors , you can view it automatically at the end . your e @-@ mail program is automatically started at the end . with the button Cl@@ ose you can sh@@ aded this window ? EN .
after starting the Modul@@ s Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions such as you want to have shown your Di@@ ash@@ au , you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ trans@@ itions option in the presentation use very elegant image inputs with Open@@ GL . you have to have a corresponding graph card because otherwise the Di@@ ash@@ au will be very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ame option allows you to view the fil@@ en@@ ame of images in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop loop provides for this the presentation in an end loop is displayed . you can manually break manually with Es@@ c .
the option pictures random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the sequence of pictures in the album .
under delay between the pictures can be set between the single pictures . 1500 millisecon@@ ds are equivalent to 1,5 seconds and are a good default value . the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen rate effect . you should test it before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly cho@@ oses to any transition between the pictures a different effect .
during the Di@@ asch@@ au , you can connect to a tool@@ bar at the top left of the edge . move the mouse into this corner to switch you .
with this tool bar , you can hold the presentation and start to start the previous and next picture and stop the Di@@ ash@@ au .
on the left bottom of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current picture and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time and date only has no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the ma@@ iling list of K@@ IP@@ I Teams under K@@ DE @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. note : participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface .
this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of sub@@ men@@ ades , as background for your K@@ DE working surface .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can see &amp; photo album ; through this Brow@@ se , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the picture , so in each group , so in people , places and in the group of keywords are available .
in the browser window , you can see the categories , for which you have entered into information to watch your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to look at the EX@@ IF @-@ based information to view the folders on your hard disk and of course the current preview pictures . in the following is described each for itself .
if you press the mouse on the entry , changes the view of the Brow@@ sers . see picture .
if you need to select a further person only the pictures are displayed on which both people are visible . by this select method , you can limit the number of displayed images from a few thousand images on a few single pictures .
if you have selected all the individuals , places and other settings , you can view preview pictures to view the images of your activity area .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; however , of course you can store an own preview picture , this is of course also defined for locations , keywords , and other categories which you have defined themselves . see this picture .
in order to view pictures next to the name , select the button which you want to use right on the tool@@ bar . in the context context menu you can select that you can view symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you have no suitable images ) .
however , you must define which image for each individual person is to be displayed . in order to view this , you will need the image for the respective person . in the case window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image will be displayed or cut off .
if you are looking for the entry window in the main window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for the Deter@@ mination of Image Properties . this dialog allows you to view this dialog .

with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all images on certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene is depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; photo album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather like to try functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; and check out the high speed , the screen photos and the introductory videos .
start a demo album ; and then select the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; for the first time , or choose the menu entry to the menu entry ; play demo . then some example will be downloaded and you can test the functions of &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you &apos;ll find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; as a associated HTML document to download .
at the bottom edge of the main window of &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; see the time bar . a picture of this strip you can see here : . as the name suggests , this cor@@ ste shows you data on the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each rental shows another unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by pointing only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can inter@@ act on the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview from the database ( if you select a date , you will always show the first picture of this date displayed on preview ) and also shows the current date of the currently displayed images , if you navigate within the preview of preview .
you can also select a range of time bar by clicking the mouse button and select the mouse over the ruler of the time bar , so the time settings will go . if you select a range , you can preview the selection , by clicking on a bar in the tim@@ eline .
&amp; photoelectric album ; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your images . the one is integrated in &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; integrated and the other as a module ( see ) . in the following part of user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; integrated version described above the menu file HTML ... click here .
before HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are described in the three areas of content , layout and purpose . in the following , each area will be precise .
first , enter the tracks and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on a photo album ; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; -@@ Export file will be created on the check page . you will find your shopping information about export @-@ files in .
recently , you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to view the viewer without description . for example , all pictures of a party are . please note that all images are exported . you can not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewing .
in this section , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most of the display options are unique , which is why not specifically entered .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures . thus , those who want to look at your website and have a monitor which supports the maximum resolution 800x600 , no pictures more download for example a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer &apos;s viewer can change the resolution at any time . it can also change your pictures with low resolution that leads to a lower transmission time , browse . if he &apos;d like a picture to appear , he changes to higher resolution .
in this site , place the various folders and the URL where your website is stored .
best select a new sub@@ folder for all your HTML files and select a new sub@@ folder for all of your HTML files .
first , you must select the main folder where all your pictures will be stored . this folder will be stored and automatically added to the next time . you can select either a folder or select by K@@ DE support protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check that these really all are visible for viewing . if you want to select a URL , after the pages have been created , the URL you can click here should be that folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in a wrong file .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in final destination folder you need to copy it manually . thus , the import function you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of current files , but the basic folder where all sub@@ folders are set .
the configuration described above have all three on base folder or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you can set in the output folder .
if you &apos;re on a family party , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; you are , you might want to create a HTML page to viewing the pictures . if you have already taken a HTML page to view the pictures , recording , etc . , you have to do with &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; this work is not yet once more .
with &amp; photoelectric Album ; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import them into your database . the image teams are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two types of .@@ k@@ im @-@ files , internal and external . you distinguish themselves if the images are stored in the file or if the images are stored in the file or if you have any pictures together , and this file can be independent , however , the obvious dis@@ advantage is the file size .
you can choose a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file extension ... or together with HTML pages , see , create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this is an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for pictures in a two way . first , the images are searched in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . if you are searching for creating HTML files , this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
the following dialog will be described for exp@@ orting images that you can call on the menu file .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should act around internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . you will find the following three selection options :
with the manuals to the .@@ k@@ im file , you have to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option auto @-@ copy to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im -@@ files are normal Zip files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG , and the XML file itself is very small , if you want to comp@@ ress this , then select the option export file compressed .
the last option of this page is maximum image size limit . if you send your friends pictures , you want to limit the images in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would not be very big . here you can say that each image should be higher than 800 pixels high and wide .
if you want to select a file using En@@ dung .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file Import Import ... , will import &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; the exported database as described in .
the assistant to import@@ ing import@@ ing four steps . first you need to import them to import pictures , then in which folder will import images to be copied .
it can be that you can person@@ ate the category persons of the import file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is asked for your database . therefore , you will be imported in the third di@@ alog@@ ical file , which are to be imported into the third di@@ alog@@ ical file and correspond to which categories are listed in your database .
in the fourth step , you can view the categories of the current file to the categories of your current database . one example can see you on the picture .
it must be simple to see pictures and see : if you see images , you want to see images of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures , on which this friend is shown .
in this manual you will find the different steps of ( 1 ) fixed the information about your pictures , through ( 2 ) the search and watch , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adjustment possibilities .
K@@ Photo@@ album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . it was extended and today also car@@ es your videos . in many places this manual is spoken about pictures , but frequently , this also closes videos with one .
&amp; photoelectric album ; stores all his information stored in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is an easy XML file which you can copy to a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ male backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where they want .
&amp; photoelectric album ; notice the folder where your pictures are stored and used this at future Star@@ ts automatically . if you want to start another database in &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; so you want to start another folder with images , you can start &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; with the option -@@ c . as example : k@@ photoelectric album -@@ c ~ / Company / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
over the menu entry settings dialog box ; set up ... come to a window where you can change the settings of &amp; photoelectric Album ; in the following section of user manual you will be explained to you the various Settings menu .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call the viewing possibilities of preview and options for viewing the viewer . for each setting , you can call an exhau@@ st@@ int to the F1 key and click on the desired option .
it was described as you can create different properties , e.g. people , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
on view the dialogue , which is used to work already existing groups . for each available group you can choose a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were mentioned above . in dialogue options , you can setup full member groups , e.g. all members of a group at once more than in one group instead of all groups of a central gli@@ eds .
in view of the Settings menu , you can choose to configure your member groups . with the top selection list , you can configure the category . in the left window , you can configure a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; photoelectric album ; divi@@ des his modular system with other graphics applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; K@@ DE ; Image Plugin Interface . you will find on the homepage from K@@ ip@@ i .
the modules can be accessed via the menu modules . the modules can not be described in this manual because it is not part of &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; but most modules have a help page that can call you on the modules itself .
since the modules are used with multiple applications together , it can be that the modules include &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; only very little tested . so , you can use the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photoelectric album demo &lt; user@@ band \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t say , I would not have warned you !
applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , so it can be a few modules with &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; not work . this is the dis@@ advantage if you divide functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; and other applications that can use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications do not support their pictures . even if &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; this type of order is not supported , so sim@@ ulates the order to albums , so you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photoelectric album .
sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; the current album which is simple to the current view , so all pictures that shows you the picture preview at the moment .
next to the current album must include &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; the modules also has a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; as follows :
if &amp; photo album , s browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you have specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums , so if you want to use the category persons , will do &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; so do if you have selected persons to view and this module will continue .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; not compatible , you can remove this from the list of modules . launch the dialog dialog and select Mod@@ ules in the Mod@@ ules , which modules should be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you get &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see at the top of a menu bar and tool@@ bar . below the tool bar , you can &apos;t see any information about your pictures . in the section we will find on this window , now click on the entry images , which shows you an overview with all existing pictures .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; is the possibility to see any picture with comments on the picture , where the picture was recorded , etc . you can set any picture either individually or for a larger number of images . if the example on all pictures is shown and all the pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all of these notes can be used for searching and Brow@@ se as you can read in the section . if you wish to see these remarks if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
in view three lists with a text field by using persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; as you will always use it again if you are using information about your pictures .
the following idea is the slide of the pictures within the list : if you have a family party , and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people can be m@@ apped , so that the used names are moved upwards , which can be moved faster and arrange them faster .
if you prefer to receive a alphabet@@ ically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting after date on the list .
if you have selected notes for each picture , you may need to edit all the selected images and provided these pictures with ann@@ ot@@ ations . Click this case simply on the front and back @-@ buttons that are located under the preview of the image .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and you can use the menu additional entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all available in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a surplus . in order to show you , a special icon is shown .
in the context menu of the anus @-@ dial@@ ogs , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new transfer or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also put an entry to a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this assumes that you just sort your categories in alphabetical order .
you can move the individual elements of the feature dial@@ ect by clicking the bar that form the surface of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window by moving him out of the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window so that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... which offers you the opportunity to save the current structure and the appearance of the window .
you can also run a frame completely . if you want to receive this window later , use the button options ... and then click here window a / off . this process will see in the picture .
if you select the entry images in your browser , you will have an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or all images if you don &apos;t have a filter . for example , you can configure the size of the imag@@ ery , by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it simply .
when you aband@@ on an image on the background of your desktop , this picture will be set as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this is shown in the image . if you have opened no windows with a picture screen , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the picture show . simply select the corresponding pictures from which you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select the Edit menu . now , you will see the window you can see in the picture .
&amp; photoelectric album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; that pictures can also be stored anywhere you have on the hard disk . in the picture you can see the image files stored anywhere you can see in the database Index . in the picture you can view a view of &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; if not all necessary images can be loaded from the hard disk .
images , where the right corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . for example 5 @-@ 9 , however , the preview pictures are available , so that you can view the preview of this pictures . you can also view these pictures with the picture viewer .
as you need this function , that you need to copy files from folders and copy it again . if you don &apos;t want to avoid the inser@@ ting of the corresponding CD . if you want to avoid trouble shooting down your images , please buy a larger hard drive to store all pictures .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , see the pictures so that at the end of those who want to see for others , you can see also all the pictures that you can see your little sister , and you can see everything else .
so you have set out what images should be hidden in the case of the F@@ everything . if you have opened the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu entry images that you have blo@@ cked off the menu . if you want to receive the pictures , click on lock .
it is also possible to define a password to un@@ lock the pictures . in order to set up this password , select password change in the menu privacy .
please do not think that this picture protection can not be sure . you can read or delete all images on the hard drive and the other can read the password as un@@ coded text . this type of password protection is used only for those who want to watch with &amp; photo album ; not very familiar , look to private images .
the reason why you want to manage all your pictures with &amp; photo album ; manage and watch over hours of course , you can see that you want to look at some point . from this reason , &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; you can preview it from preview , as described in .
the viewer can be seen in . it is of course the image , but additional all the information you have on the picture , such as who is on the image , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can also configure and retri@@ eve the mouse on the top of the image . you can also configure , which are displayed on the viewer . all these options are available on the viewer &apos;s right click .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click on the browser , see , matching entries to this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures from Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were interested persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have several pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them and go back by using the keys picture of high and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu .
if several pictures are invited in the viewer , you can run this as Di@@ asch@@ au . &amp; k@@ photoelectric album , then you will load a new picture after a few seconds . how often a new picture can be checked by using the C@@ tr@@ l button and Plus or minus .
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you are using the viewer , you can simply cut off the image in the picture . by using the mouse button , you can simply cut out a rectangle with the mouse button . showing how a zoom @-@ rectangle is marked and shows the result of the Z@@ OO@@ MS .
with the point key , you can reset your zoom , so that the picture is not zo@@ om@@ t . with the mouse button sets the Z@@ OO@@ MS , so that each pixel is shown to the screen of the image .
note that the only zoom stations work with videos that are in and out @-@ zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ ust@@ s .
with the scripts from the context menu , you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can tell us about the current picture with the menu comments from the context menu .
if you have a look at the picture you can see a picture with one person whose name you will forget to open the image and open the dialog of the Image to view this name . however , you might want to mark this name and see further pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see what photos you can start the viewer with the pictures and watch it as good or bad , while you can watch one after the other .
for the two examples above gives you the possibility to get images with features , while you view it . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic that you are using the corresponding letters . in view a picture , where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have selected features on your pictures , these can be displayed in the browser . so you can see all the pictures you want , print or whatever you &apos;ve ever selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected images to copy or whatever you want to make .
categories and especially features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can view the categories in DR@@ E preview view , then you can press features to the pictures , after clicking the letters , after the picture was selected . this can see here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you to paint &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; painting on the picture .
the m@@ old is not saved with the image , but in the database . on the way you can re@@ vo@@ ke your mixture later .
you can see a picture on the painted picture . in order to switch the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photoelectric album ; please switch on the image from the context menu . to finish the painting , you simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; you need to have the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should not be read and understood .
inside the object , you can select individual objects . then the properties are displayed in the object features and the object in the wire model views are shown .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the sub@@ object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects have already been selected using the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are more possible positions , the following commands can be set up , so you can choose the right position :
with delete either from the menu bar under edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed features , click on users to take advantage of these changes . if you have inv@@ alid values , a message with an error description can be displayed , then click on the user or re@@ ject the changes .
once you enter the path to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation necessary to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can view a preview of Fe@@ ast View Vie@@ ws .
press a preview of Fe@@ at@@ ography view and a small example of the scene is illustrated by the selected texture . when default , the whole texture rate is selected , even if you want to select a part of the texture rate ( for example a texture rate inside a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , cross locally .
the screenshot shows the control points of the camera . you can pull this control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
if a transformation is selected , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for sli@@ pping . you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has an order level as a wire model . you can only specify this value relative to the level of visual object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected or equal to the level of vision of the Vis@@ ibility level of the scene .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window arrangement as default . the object @-@ tree and the view of the object features are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the default window configuration , or if you need any other configuration , you can easily save them . you can also store several window orders and simply switch between different instructions .
to an@@ cho@@ red a window over or below one of a view , enter the p@@ asser to the top or bottom edge of a view . a rectangle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , enter the Anf@@ asser to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you wish to arrange several views over each other , enter the Anf@@ asser in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map series at the top in the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : opinions that are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view out of the anchor , enter the Anf@@ al into the next arrow pointing to the next arrow .
to close a view , click the small cross in the Anf@@ al bar . in order to prevent the closing , click on the square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu View you &apos;ll find entries for any kind of views . new views are dirty , you can be an@@ cho@@ red in any position .
the current window view can be saved with View window . it will display a dialog where you can save the window rules under an existing or new name .
if you have a scene , you can ren@@ ame it . &amp; p@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ ders , this program has to be installed properly . when this manual was written correctly , was &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported .
in order to ren@@ ame the current scene , click the symbol Ren@@ ders The Symbol Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry of the scene .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determin@@ es the image size and quality of ren@@ ders . if you want to ren@@ ame a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can add any many R@@ ender @-@ modes , from a fast preview of up to full images in highest quality .
if you click on the Symbol The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or in the menu View R@@ ender modes ... select the following dialog will open :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can set any name any name , but it is a name that can recognize the characteristics of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the straight image . if you want to ren@@ ew only a small area of the image , select the check box section and enter the picture section to the Ren@@ ders in the input fields .
in combination with quality , you can select the properties tab . this is used by a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
if a picture is reduced with only one beam , you can create different errors . these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è samples or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technology called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , images with this feature is better .
if you turn on Anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is a adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because every pixel is still sub@@ divided and adap@@ tive because the rec@@ ur@@ sion@@ ing depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a beam of pixel . if the difference between the color indicate the specified pixels , both pixels will be calculated by 4x4 additional points , with a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixels . if the difference between the colour values specified , then the pixels will be divided into 4 sub@@ pixel , which can be evaluated individually and placed on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the rec@@ itals can be adjusted by depth of depth .
another possibility to reduce ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . when you turn j@@ itter@@ ing , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays of a tiny amount to avoid regular samples .
the last setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diffuse reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diffuse light reflection is calculated . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this cardboard card you can adjust whether the Alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the per@@ tin@@ ent beams have no object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ scene to import , select the menu entry file ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently , &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler is currently not yet the full command reception of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if you occur when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog box shows a list of all messages .
if you don &apos;t want to support source code in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ ning and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can extract objects from object @-@ tree to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it adds the source text of the object into the opened text file in the Editor , simply select the source code in the Editor and draw it in the object tree .
with copying and inser@@ tion in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor , you can also insert source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also included .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler is a scene . usually this p@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ p@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on assistance in the self @-@ dependent view , opens &amp; p@@ ov@@ ray ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set here the path to your document and version 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; sear@@ ches for external files ( for example al@@ at@@ ed@@ oms ) into the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you do not refer to files , do not need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is used in different path of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected check@@ points .
the colour of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type characteristic .
you can set the object of points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can find here the grid separated for sli@@ pping , sc@@ aling and swi@@ v@@ ings .
larger values indicate a more accurate wire model , making better time for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ ders . for some objects such as the sphere , you can set the detailed level for two directions .
if you cross a detailed projection for extended projec@@ tions , all wire model views are used , all projec@@ tions are used . advanced projec@@ tions are all projec@@ tions with excep@@ tions and the vertical projec@@ tions . this feature gives a better approach to the projec@@ tions , but requires more time to ren@@ ders .
when you cross a wall , there will be a wall behind the objects . the wall is shown in a chess bre@@ tt@@ p from two adjustable colours .
when you view the ground , there will be a floor below the objects . the floor is shown in a chess bre@@ tt@@ p from two adjustable colours .
when you check out cant@@ onal anti@@ ali@@ asing method , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for the rendering of scenes . the values for depth and threshold can be adjusted . detailed information regarding the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ modes .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section window orders , you can create and save window orders .
the combination field standard window system : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , used the chosen window regulations at the start of the program .
the list of submitted window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement , you can create with the button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Remove .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear@@ ely and cannot be empty .
the list below the name shows all views of the chosen window regulations . new views can add with the button Add and delete selected views with the button Remove .
the position of the new window . with new column you can create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with cart@@ ons you get a map card view together with the previous view and easily an@@ cho@@ red the view in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; and now you would like to follow more specific knowledge of both programs . if you can follow all steps in this guide , you should easily create the ultimate but simple scene , amongst others : a ball on one level .
but you should keep the following war@@ nings carefully before you make sure that you can only use a black screen . if you use a 3D program for first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set any camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you will receive a black image .
if you don &apos;t add light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will receive only a black image .
if you have all f@@ law@@ less installed , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the following pre@@ set window rules :
take a little time to learn the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar . please read the documentation that you can expect to expect from this program .
you will have to use this menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also the application .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow these instructions , you &apos;ll need to remove all objects from the object @-@ tree . select the scene and then select Edit menu to Edit . so you will now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera shows the whole scene that you generate . in particular , note the scene from the camera view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
the object @-@ tree now contains a new entry containing the designation camera . if you click on it , see the contents of the view object features where the various parameters of the camera are displayed . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find further details .
change anything to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but notice that the camera has to change the camera in view points , with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click on a control point and drag it to the desired position .
if you push the button user interface or press the input , change the wire model views and the object @-@ tree immediately after these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view@@ point of the camera .
there are many possibilities to create the ground for the scene . you could adjust the box ( insert the body Qu@@ ader ) and size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a controversi@@ al method for the solution of this task .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; actually offers a simpler possibility . you can deplo@@ y an infinite layer as floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button user or the input . inside the tree , the new name is immediately displayed .
the wire model view shows now also the level , if at the moment just as a limited plane . when you ren@@ ame the scene , the level extends up to the horiz@@ on .
if you can see the object tree exactly , you will find the entry for the floor if you can click on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case , you will find the default options for any new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . choose one of these options , also changing the possible settings in the view of the object features .
in this scene , you should shift the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to know some of these parameters . choose the shift and set the values as follows :
simply select the ground in order to set its material properties . there are many different materials , but select at the moment some notes .
in both cases , a dialog box will open in which you can select as the object is to be inserted . you can change the name in the object @-@ tree . you can view the name in the self @-@ speaking view ( Name = bottom pigment ) , with one click on the button preview it looks like the pigment now looks .
of course , the preview of the pigments do only have a matte black material , because you can always check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . now , give the colors for the pigment . also there are many possibilities , but now take the eas@@ iest way .
if you don &apos;t want to see a preview of color on Qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button user and call the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you &apos;re right now with one click on the symbol , you should get the following result :
of course you do not have the color . you need to set two new attributes . here , select this entry twice ( you can do this too often , but the chess boards available can only be used with two colors ) :
select in object @-@ tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object features :
this step should you be simply run , as you should have understood the basic work of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the ball is just how easy to create the ground :
in view of the object features you can change the settings immediately . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input or push button user ) , so the ball would turn on the ground , as you have post@@ pon@@ ed the ground by one unit to down@@ wards .
of course , the ren@@ ders now makes a strange result : as previously shown , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . set in the following step a suitable material .
if you select the ball , you can now refer to a material now . as at the bottom , you give the ball a pigment as a color :
select the first sub@@ object and change the name for example in ball pigment . Click on ball pigment , then select one @-@ colour and set the values as follows :
but you can reach an interesting effects , if you take time to set a few finish features :
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on the user or press the input .
the brightness shine effect and reflection already shows good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome surfaces , even if metal is not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of them which offers you &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; hop@@ efully you &apos;ve learned so much so much you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to generate a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
when you have a Sc@@ ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing , the Ren@@ derer hypo@@ thet@@ ical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes at the scene , and like atmospheric effects of the light sources in the scene , and how atmospheric effects can act as an example of fog . so the scene pixels is arranged for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source , you can see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously , any scene needs to be drawn , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file which you have previously made with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ;
whenever you open a new model or create , the file is inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . it is a new file , you &apos;ll need to enter a name and space .
the scene have recovered in the last saved version . all changes have been rejected since the last storage .
you can only select this menu only if you don &apos;t have saved changes in the scene .
repeat the most recently revers@@ ed command . this menu entry may only select if you use editing .
stores the current window configuration and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or writing a new arrangement .
in this menu you can find options for setting &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; , here you can change the appearance , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .

a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a possibility to adjust rough surfaces without any hi@@ ves on the surface and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ rical forms which can use as blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic body . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color to pixel @-@ based , by application of a picture file as a color chart .

&amp; sk@@ in@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that doesn &apos;t make more than pictures to scan and p@@ ush@@ ers .
&amp; sk@@ il@@ l@@ ite ; is an easy application for scanning images that do not make more than pictures to scan and retri@@ eved ; can open a dialog for storing or save the images in a given folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also show the pictures before saving it .
you can check the status of your scanner on the s@@ ane project page by using the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ pro@@ ject@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ p@@ l .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ il@@ l@@ ite ; if this scanner can not be opened or if no default scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user may select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner and stop the scanner and stop it .
other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ in@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not affect these options .
in order to remove a picture , the user can start a preview can start and then select scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
in order to select the picture the user can go into the picture and out of the current selection , it can also adjust the zoom in the zoom that the complete preview can fit in the window .
if the image has been selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
if before saving a preview of view in the settings , the image will be displayed in a preview window , as shown below , then the image will be stored and sh@@ lie ? EN leads to a break@@ down and you come back into the main window .
through the button settings , the ep@@ onymous dialogue is opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the picture , if desired , consider before saving . in this case , the option must display a preview before saving a preview . if this preview of the user is not desired , the option must be chosen .
this setting allows you to select the type such as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images can select the dialog for each image open the dialog before each image , open the dialog before each image . if &amp; sk@@ in@@ l@@ ite , this automatically shall store with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you &apos;ll need to store Save without a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines if the pictures are stored in the option Save without a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as a standard for the Save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this using the button ...
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the image automatically to save images and is also uploaded to the proposed name for the image in the dialog when a picture is stored automatically when a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can custom@@ ize the image quality output . this value is also changing the compression value for saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .

the D@@ COP interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , play@@ list , play@@ list browser and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ COP @-@ function break could be &amp; z@@ b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should not give the user a feedback when the script can not be executed because of a missing dependence on whether all the required modules are present and use the dialog box that the user does not run it .
Beg@@ in Requ@@ ire &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is Requ@@ ired for this script . &apos; . dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the folder scripts / Templates you will find a lot of presentation scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a basis for your own scripts , or simply click the necessary functions . you will find that the writing of scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ COP you can exchange your scripts with Amar@@ ok and Tax@@ es . the eas@@ iest way is the use of command d@@ co@@ p ; which should shoot any K@@ DE installation .
most script enables the result of external programs and commands . in addition , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy to be called . here is an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ arok ; sends alerts to all current scripts . for this reason , Str@@ ings should continuously monitor their default setting and respond to events . of course , scripts can also ign@@ ore the events even if there is no use for it .
configure , specify the script to view the setup dialog . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the desktop folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ change signals that a new piece is used . the script might be &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP functions further information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the unit length ) .
volume Change new@@ volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ iz@@ able : sub@@ mer@@ it@@ em@@ t@@ Tit@@ le . contains the path to the selected files of play@@ list , if a user @-@ defined menu entry can also be used to add the script the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok ( sub@@ mer@@ it@@ onal Tit@@ le ) . in order to remove one entry again , you can use d@@ co@@ p am@@ ci@@ script to e@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ mer@@ it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; am@@ arok are ended , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ arok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do , for example , store data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ oks script can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server . such pack@@ ets can be compressed as b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) which can be easily detected by b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) that the user may definitely recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script .
&amp; am@@ arok ; 1.3 only script packages to accept a script with the Advanced @-@ script . for this reason , your script should be just correct .
the main proposition must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the rest to the lad@@ der modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
when your script is finished , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and hang it to the Wik@@ i scripts page of &amp; am@@ arok ; attach@@ ments . for your entry to K@@ DE @-@ apps you should use the category am@@ arok ; script script .

am@@ aro@@ K needs only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to install K@@ deli@@ bs ( including the programs contained therein , because &amp; am@@ arok ; requires some of them , for example modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide , how to compiled K@@ deli@@ bs minimum .
some functions such as O@@ SD is prec@@ eded that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work for example . we try to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment .
probably , one of your files take a bug in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can see this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bug@@ gi@@ v@@ de.@@ org and hang it to the Cap@@ ut@@ te file that caused the crash . thereafter , you can er@@ ase the file and create the collection again .

if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . the support is in &amp; am@@ arok ; is a little mature .
make sure all of &amp; am@@ ples ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler @-@ version . if , B. &amp; am@@ arok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x was compiled , then this leads to the editing of met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate autom@@ atics , if in@@ active for ... into the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is important that many programs write data as UTF @-@ 8 in met@@ a @-@ information , but it is not known as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / us@@ r / bin / Perl die &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ b = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error when writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; ) $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ b . it can be installed using this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; am@@ arok ; s icons are always active in the status bar ( random orbit / repet@@ ition / dynamic play@@ list ) . this is a well @-@ known mistake in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can see the status Off on grey and half @-@ transparent . please note that in some cases up to three times you have to click on a symbol , until this setting has its effect .
if you get this mist@@ akes : icon L@@ ook@@ up error : Un@@ locks symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ v K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check whether am@@ aro@@ K does the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ ph@@ amar@@ ca &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p Q@@ T .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ous Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that am@@ aro@@ K first finds the correct version .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems clari@@ fy in the eas@@ iest way through the help of a experts your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use help on other users or in the developers . use this forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the Canal # am@@ arok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please take only one error if you find anything at the Beh@@ avi@@ or of an error in am@@ aro@@ K itself .
after the launch of &amp; am@@ arok ; only an empty play@@ list appears only . how do music pieces come there ?
that &apos;s simple . use the file browser on the left hand side and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the play@@ list .
to maintain the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the starting window was converted into the statistic window . you will find it under ex@@ tras statistics .
the significance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are available for the evaluation by users , while the points will be charged automatically .
to evaluate plays in the play@@ list , the evaluation list must be displayed . Click here with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title track of the play@@ list and select column . you can also use the short command line Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files that you want to remove and press it on your keyboard . or click on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From play@@ list menu from the drop @-@ down menu .
go through a play@@ list file with your mouse into the play@@ list and let it fall there , just as you would like to do it with other files . so simple is this : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , directly next to the add button , you can save the button play@@ list . Click on .
probably missing the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el package and install &amp; am@@ arok ; new . take a look after lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ al@@ izations .

no . Yes , that is true ! no ! &amp; am@@ arok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question of which media types does not support G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ mm / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support this rather only possible audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even add text and P@@ NG de@@ coding !
it may be ! maybe you can use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , where the default value does not use MP3 de@@ bit or supplied ( of patented reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 K@@ DE , insert
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well , so ... &amp; am@@ arok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device needs to use a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device to the same time and can be reached via a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software Mi@@ xer ) . see the Help D@@ mix for AL@@ SA .
the output of this command should help you in search of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify a different sink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) .
that does &amp; am@@ arok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first de@@ coded . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice if you read a dé@@ or with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded them and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coding the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can also output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open the control centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable Sound@@ server with highest priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ or@@ ity ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( call , see next point of FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ ou@@ ra@@ pper is adjusted :

either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia to get the faster Arts @-@ co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimized for analy@@ zer , or reduce the size of the buffer buff@@ ers in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . depending on the buffer , the less mot@@ ions respond to visu@@ al@@ izations . Yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; am@@ arok . why ?

read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if not helps , you can also ask the I@@ RC -@@ Channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - Download you down , comp@@ ile and install it . then run the module file from G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with g@@ st @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run g@@ st register again . start now &amp; am@@ arok ; .

set up under the am@@ aro@@ K settings ... audio output give you the device . typically , e.g. HW @-@ 0 is for the standard sound card and HW @-@ 1 for the second .
here you can see an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a onboard Wi @-@ 97 codec and a USB audio unit :

enter the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ Audio , and the output is based on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of sampling rate , channels and so on .
if you want to use a virtual mix @-@ mix , de@@ activate the tick with sound card m@@ map .

e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and play automatically all videos in the basic folder of CD .
this is a comfortable way to load recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry opens the project .
stores the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file , otherwise , will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
stores the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialogue Save As is displayed , you can select the file and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
stores all opened projects . this is the same when you would like to store for each single project file .
includes the current project . if a project has changed and not saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what should be done . you can then choose between saving and changes . furthermore , you can also break off and keep the project so open .
includes all completed projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each not stored project , what should be done , just as you would have called for any project file .
includes all completed projects and ended &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . for each not stored project , what should be done so as if you would have called Cl@@ ose .
if you call this entry , you can select via the release dialog for adding the project . this has the same effect when you can draw the files directly from the top view into the Project View . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the basic folder of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; Br@@ ass &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the characteristics of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; the burning process can be open only if the project is already included .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can change many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above what is this ? -@@ Help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this is useful when you are using files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful if you have not used files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is not used when using this function , so that you can see the files already existing files and folders .
this entry appears only for active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function illustrates &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this feature is not removed from the medium , it ends only the previously imported files again .
opens the CD copying dialog . this allows you to create a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a CD on another medium . alternatively , you can also prefer a copy of the normal copy of the normal copy . you should also prefer to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copying dialog . this allows you to create a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can even burn the possibility of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can still have the possibility of a DVD with help of copying dial@@ ogs . Moreover , the target media must be big enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ etion of a CD @-@ RW . thus you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog for form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialogue you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format which will be completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; you can write the choice between the writing modes and incre@@ mental .

bur@@ ns a earlier DVD copy . the dialog will take you to a * .@@ is@@ o file as data source , which can be burned immediately due to pressing the burning button .
a previously used DVD video can be converted . this dialog window will typically be converted to the reading of a DVD in the content screen , but can also be used below . it contains information about the used video , co@@ di@@ ver settings and even options to change the size and cutting black edges .
displays information on the specified medium . this information is represented in the content screen and include the characteristics of the media , such as size and titles length of CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool bars &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if a entry is crossed , the tool bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small glue at the bottom edge of the window is displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is closed .
switches the folder view , or off . folder Vie@@ ws contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content screen is activated , the content menu will also appear in the content screen . CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with functions like Media Info , blocking and un@@ locking of the drive or thro@@ wing of the media .
automatically switches the content screen . the content screen allows you to select and pulling files into the screen view . the image view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in folder view was selected .
switches the head@@ band in the screen view , or off . the header bar is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project bar contains no real function , it looks just beautiful and separates the screen view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog box for changing the button orders for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . after one of the available commands selected in the upper part you can adjust the button assignment below .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup assist@@ ants . thus , the correct authorization to burn CDs and DVDs are required . therefore , system administrator rights are required , therefore you need to enter the password for system manager ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . here , general program settings can be made . almost all the features of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on an@@ ie@@ b . this dialog is intended for person@@ al@@ ise and to custom@@ ize the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ applications also , with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface is equipped with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled by means of a shaft .
in order to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are in the function of the functional scope , so it is rather your taste and the type of your tasks are crucial , which the programs you wish .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . in order to make the &amp; D@@ COP ; you need to ensure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b , you &apos;ll need to make something like the following at the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have common &amp; K@@ DE ; program common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below .

&amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reading for &amp; K@@ DE . with him can easily read audio CD ; s read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder which is installed on the computer .
&amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in WAV files on hard drive ) and from many Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers who are currently supported this WAV files ( comp@@ ress using Linux distribution ) . further coefficient may be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( generally one pro title ) is compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or other formats like the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used . almost any distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ ging up ( for OGG ) or other co@@ di@@ ers have already exist . all these programs are not necessary to comp@@ ile any Linux distri@@ butions . however , if FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is not necessary , the installation is not necessary .
what body / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer is a small introduction of Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already mentioned , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia , for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to avoid any copy protection . this program is not possible to avoid any copy protection ; even not the mechanisms of copy protection . avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD ; s !
while the setup must be made only once ( the setup dialog can be viewed as often as a suitable configuration ) , the daily use of a &amp; CD ; on the hard drive , this leads ( hop@@ efully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which will be frequent in the beginning .
can convert many formats - depending on which coefficients will be installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; retri@@ eve information from Free@@ DB by Internet or can fully work without network , where everything is manually recorded .
this is just a brief list of commands of the main window . on the side step by step example , more information , such as this program is used as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the regist@@ ering cards for the configuration of the program .
starting on request , the CD@@ DB covers the CD data according to the device &apos;s CD@@ DB file card . ( this may be locally or online , in the latter case , first must first be manufactured using the Internet . )
start reading and when an encoder is configured in the tab tab setting the coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available Encoder , so that the selection with other Encoder can be read as the default . it is to be observed that before the Encoder has been configured in the dialog dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already rented file is selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and encoding .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of alerts ( like protocols , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program@@ ing ( like reading the &amp; CD ; end ) to configure .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; with different mapping cards ( like Encoder , to set the encoder ) . here you need to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ di@@ ers and compression rates and helps you to choose the right Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
if no audio information is supposed to go lost , a loss@@ less audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats , you lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG likes today have a slight advantage against MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate the differences are very important because both co@@ di@@ ers produce very good audio quality .
O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still delivered with most distributors , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to OGG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates .
OGG - If only music is to be heard from one computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG @-@ play@@ able devices is present .
MP3 - If music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually support the MP3 format .
a brief list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting makes good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting is usually acceptable for most people and most music pieces acceptable to transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set Extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires more than 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of one title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR Joint stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a Tit@@ le . good enough for music from young people , portable devices and auto@@ oster@@ one systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely do the highest quality , then choose the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information , manually entered or collected by the program automatically from Free@@ DB via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; and the code program to generate the folder and file names and characteristics of music files .
in connection with Ko@@ di@@ er@@ programs there is often a combination of program settings for the Ko@@ di@@ erer and these parameters here . the manual or help to the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers explain the switch for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the sample ( english : day ) if MP@@ 3s with l@@ ame is encoded , the switch -@@ tt is of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; the result looks as follows : &apos; -@@ tt { From ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; parameters which can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
this is what the Free@@ DB file is : a free database , in which the audio CDs can read / enter , so that all the other information can be downloaded / enter into the computer . it is said to note that here only by text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
Yes , it should be legal but I ( An@@ m of the translation ) is not lawyer . however , nobody can prevent that you are given public on the &amp; CD ; however , no more or less valuable , so the information can be added to the music company . all information can be saved by a B@@ um@@ mel by a &amp; CD ; business , physi@@ cally , or virtual , can be obtained .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is active to choose a check box ( S@@ end of an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems that the email address is not used when checking the data from server ( This can only know the programmer that has reviewed the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; for use Free@@ DB , the geographical zone should be used to use Free@@ DB , this saves bandwidth on the network and resem@@ bles the load between the computers .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirrors for the online demand of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the entire database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database .
what reading program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that with c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want more precisely , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the matching distribution must first be installed , if this is not yet done .
to save the rented WAV files , the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be chosen and thus select the desired file format . at the first opening , the code for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) can be added to this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the coefficient may be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined co@@ di@@ ers . further information about Ko@@ di@@ erer are in the chapter pupp@@ y Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers , more information about his switches can be obtained through the input of an commands like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) is replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read@@ iness of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) . try to retri@@ eve both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give a note what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this may be done just as you proceed .
have you read the complete manual , everything is understood but som@@ eh@@ ow are still un@@ sure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ for @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to create those areas , which want to make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , and read everything and our first &amp; CD ; we will use MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 stit@@ ch ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution , as it is not completely free software , as it is not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , whatever you can do .
please make sure that the directory / us@@ r / share / cd is possible and that you own write permission ( eg ; trying to copy with the con@@ quer@@ or anything ) .
the first section deals with basic setup of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; something which will probably be done only once and
the second part describes how to read out a CD ; what needs to be repeated &amp; CD ; it must be repeated .
here we determine the well @-@ used coefficient of music ( l@@ ame ) and the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( MP3 ) as well as we are la@@ zy to use the program with the Free@@ DB program to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet download .
although we can change this settings at any time , we will not be able to read them in any reading of a &amp; CD ; if once the matching settings are found .
the device name is given to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can read .
often / dev / c@@ drom a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can also be used , so it can also be used on the drive / etc / f@@ rod and an attempt with the entries of the device records for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the ticket map general settings . here is no longer to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined here . in our example , everything will be shown as shown in the screenshot .
only for in@@ complete information , you will be informed if you are informed when using keywords ( tags ) .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and can be downloaded &amp; CD ; data automatically via the Internet from a Free@@ DB computer .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD ; to be connected to the Internet , so that it can access the Free@@ DB server .
the second selection field is simpler , a &amp; CD ; entry was found immediately , if you are un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting directories / fil@@ en@@ ame or file name , can be changed easily . the directory and file name is changed with con@@ qu@@ ilt - &gt; ren@@ aming and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; tag@@ ger .
in addition to this example , if you want to install everything manually , then de@@ activate the selection fields and Free@@ DB . however , this can be used twice , if you can use Free@@ DB in off @-@ mode mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first setting . the mode is set up at the following box .
CD@@ DB is for us Free@@ DB . these are settings for data @-@ demand , for retri@@ eve the &amp; CD ; information from Free@@ DB server via the Internet . how does the system know which data can be released ? read the section about Free@@ DB . put everything in the screenshot .
mode : we don &apos;t have downloaded the database , we want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and look at a mirror server in your proximity . on this way the load is distributed between the computers . however , this setting is however able to work as the first attempt .
both work as well as the server , as many Fire@@ walls the protocol 88@@ 80 &apos;s standard , is perhaps more lucky with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to transfer &amp; CD ; data to the Free@@ DB server . the first check box should be sufficient .
simply take the settings from the screenshot . ( make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
number of simultaneously run pieces : exc@@ use , there is a reason why more than one at the same time when using only one existing drive ? parallel it and cook ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore just try yourself .
CD ; put out the CD in order to read out the last piece : cross this about the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom files for temporary files : if you cross this file , then you can pass the path / folders that can be saved in which the WAV files are stored . if the box is not enabled , the file will not be enabled , if you don &apos;t want to make this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files .
all such as it is on screen photo . the command is something long , under circumstances may need to be b@@ lown up to the right .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned , it is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo . this reached compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be used when needed . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; K@@ DE ; in case of subsequent alter@@ ations of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the names of the inputs ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
place the rest as in screen photo . some comments for future use outside this sample :
number of simultaneous WAV files : with a dual core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried , more than a WAV file simultaneously .
this is , we &apos;ve just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; this configuration is used as standard for any reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
this section is described as the process of the reading of the &amp; CD ; we will build on the hard disk . we will be built in the previous section , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from Free@@ DB you want to retri@@ eve data from Free@@ DB . the process of data is described in this section must be repeated for any subsequent &amp; CD .
since we use one &amp; CD ; not included in Free@@ DB , the screen photos are a little different than the data for one &amp; CD ; with successfully deleted by Free@@ DB files , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually can be retri@@ eved from the internet instead of which they refer to the differences .
don &apos;t try to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD ; in the drive that was defined in the main window , is switched on .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screenshot . this only if the &amp; CD ; identified as audio CD ; identified and from c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia can be read .
if this is not happening , you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the Free@@ DB , all titles are already completed and will display the name of the artist and the album .
for the case , it is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; Key for your &amp; CD ; there is a window built , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion is best to your &amp; CD ; fits in your opinion .
if you don &apos;t have the check box for automatic query output of Free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for Settings ) , you can also solve this manually by selecting the first Kn@@ op@@ fs in the tool@@ bar . if you have no local database , but you will need the connection to the Internet .
E 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo , the piece of the piece in the first row of the &quot; actu@@ ator title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must not be entered in the input field &apos; Update title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ ac per unit , the comment field of the album will be used for comments using the CD .
attention : after the successful conclusion of the data from Free@@ DB , the CD editor is not empty , but it is always quite a good idea to check the content of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors , so that you are not only happy with the artist and album name ( such as all words with big letter or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any un@@ wanted remarks .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited to the length of the fields marked for the artist , album and titles of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you are using ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags ; this option is set up at the tab code settings ; take a look at the code &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the day information of generated files later at any time with the Tag Editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with him you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags will not be supported by all Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers or file formats . see the help of the body to obtain more information .
just select a record , which is obvious with the style of the un@@ lock CD ; this example is not important that we do not transfer the &amp; CD ; data just like to read on fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap can be found under Rock .
after selecting &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD Ed@@ itors appears again and you see that the fields of the album have already been covered with the given data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . specify the item for each case and other information you wish .
please click on the next line in the main window and process you in the same way until you have entered all the titles data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window appears not when you downloaded the data from Free@@ DB . you &apos;re already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the item list .
note that there is a check @-@ sign before each line of a piece . only the titles are selected . a simple click on the line switches that all pieces are selected , or call the button All pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces at one time .
after clicking on the button select the reading process is started , this window appears to confirm . Click OK and then we will throw a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
Click on the tab orders to change the order window . it is in the left half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message you can see if you are trying to work with a co@@ di@@ erer , which you have not installed yet . pieces that were not successful with a red &apos; X &apos; in the Con@@ list list .
by the way , the folders for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example . did you checked if you have a write access to the folders for temporary files and destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear that the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece .
the job 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . thus , reading and en@@ code parallel . please note the status in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration options to supp@@ ress this behaviour . the only one appears , the number of parallel processes is un@@ clear . the computer used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to read and en@@ code reading ( however , two different tracks ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is encoded and a third order is encoded in the qu@@ eu@@ e of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is encoded , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window ends .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the coefficient of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; today , it is possible to download an anonymous copy today within the &amp; K@@ DE . most distri@@ butions do not include a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; a part of an important &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ package is . if you read this , you have probably already done it ...
this section is directed to persons who comp@@ ile the source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you want to search for your needs such as the program can be adapted if it runs once , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls for many different programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the different cardboard cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still read on ? even if only the help menu is clicked on the first time starting from the program , without any reference point as it is supposed to go on ( especially if the program is not audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from un@@ usually short menu ?
what does it work ? or who reads that , probably the program has started . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can not keep this manual . it is the first version for a manual to &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; it is thought that it is always something to add or change it . at least , only after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has signed this section and is therefore agreed with this suggest@@ ion .
strange if you have managed to pick the source file from &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; K@@ DE . in addition to others , with real @-@ time gra@@ fic and kar@@ aoke @-@ real @-@ time collection of texts , some features which have not have other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players did not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - und &amp; K@@ DE ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound repository , which is needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa will be embedded as soon as it supports a sequence .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing colour , making it easy to follow the piece .
graphical display of activity of any MIDI channel by using the num@@ eric keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop to drop in &amp; K@@ DE ; any MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window can be placed on K@@ Mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( rec@@ itals or texts ) . K@@ Mid determin@@ es the process automatically .
seat support . if you finish &amp; K@@ DE ; during the recording of a song , K@@ mid will kick off the same song once again with the same song .
supports external MIDI Syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you select the desired song .
you can also open a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to the &amp; k@@ mid &apos; window . this works also with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a music piece , open it and confirm the button playing in the tool@@ bar , select the entry play from the menu piece , or bet@@ ting the Le@@ ert@@ aste .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts , as soon as you go to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . ( with several pieces they are added to a collection , and then played another one another . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump on any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive with the kno@@ b .
if you find that a song is played to quickly or slowly , you can click on the arrows to the left and right the speed of the speed . to get back the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the Le@@ vi@@ ans has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the empty space , like a pressure on the button pause , or the exit of menu entry in the menu , thus break the playback . if no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be saved on two types in a music piece . some pieces use text con@@ vocation , others use lyrics and lyrics and other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust which events will be displayed , and even better : the event type is automatically selected , so that you need to adjust nothing manually . if you want to manually adjust the kar@@ aoke text , you will always have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other kind .
if you want to set up a event type , choose from the menu settings the entries or rec@@ ital lines . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you want to summar@@ ize . these will be part of the series after playback . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find this menu under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can set the profits in the collection manager .
into the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application this collection will not be stored . consider this if you add many pieces .
in order to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song . there , again , you can select the file dialog , with which help you select the desired song .
a second method to add a song , depends on the setting up to a collection .
if automatic add to the collection , a piece when opening ( when opening file or drag &amp; drop ) is automatically added to the active collection .
if automatic add to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and e@@ ert . this collection will then be added to the un@@ opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you &apos;ll need to open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removal .
you can select the sequence in which the songs will play back . if you select the series after the menu sequence of the menu collections , songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove or random order in the menu , the order will be reset .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump a song , select the button Next song , the entry next song from the menu , or press the arrow on the right .
to jump a song back , select the button one piece , the entry to previous piece from the menu , or press the button arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection , and click the button Del@@ ete .
the temporary collection can &apos;t be deleted . however , that doesn &apos;t matter , since it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ;
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are non @-@ General MIDI files . in this case , the MIDI map general @-@ MIDI events translated into events that under@@ stands the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et , making it always a trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards GM is compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
sorry , there is no programs to create MIDI maps . therefore , you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite bar ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that saves all the requirements for the play of a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section , which may appear so often as desired . a prer@@ equ@@ is@@ ite for this is that every occurr@@ ence had a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; name of key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; A further Key@@ map ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D
they see that De@@ fine is needed to view that a section starts ( except for options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send your map file as an e @-@ mail , so that I can support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
in this section , the patch of General MIDI is shown on your specific keyboard . the general use will see as follows :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ig@@ no@@ red . it is believed that the GM is in the correct sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds which this instrument need to put on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard is not using a tissue ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can take a ring ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so , if you want to play an MIDI file a note with patch 127 ( fabric surplus ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound in the MIDI file is available .
please note that here , with the term Dr@@ um Patch the Patch , there is a different per@@ tu@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one that means the sound level of the pitch on the same drum ( like some keyboards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is used to add sounds like sounds on a specific channel or instrument . use is :
as in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of the lines is very important , so the availability . you must create 128 items .
you can define multiple keyboard maps for each channel and every instrument . you have to use different names in the first row .
keyboards are mainly used to sk@@ ip sounds on the Per@@ kus@@ sions @-@ Canal . check out as an example the supplied key@@ maps .
this section can be used to replace some channels on others . if you want to replace the first and second channel , simply make it simply in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others require channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP Section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , according to the following pattern :
n is the channel , which is set on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map does not need to use the name name for this channel . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch Option , all events will ign@@ ore all events that try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is always used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to use the Per@@ kus@@ sions @-@ Patch on the Per@@ kus@@ sions @-@ channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch Ben@@ ders to be multiplied in which relationship pitch @-@ ben@@ der events will be multiplied by the value n , this with the formula n * ( r / 4096 ) is converted and then re@@ directed . the value 4096 is used , so that in the Map file does not stand dec@@ imal .
this setting is needed because GM is presenting a keyboard that is to play a Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 4096 to play a tone higher . unfortunately , some keyboards are trying to play two tones up to a oc@@ tave . you &apos;ll need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . you can find in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole row of piano ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these cla@@ vi@@ atures you will see which sounds are just played .
you can also use the channel view , in order to change the instrument on a specific channel . if you have changed an instrument , the button does not switch to green but red , to view that no longer used the original instrument .
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to view the played tones . view the Settings menu under the point channel view : settings
the speed @-@ LCD displays the speed , which is played a song . the higher the number , the bigger the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . if you will find such a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a music piece has to be played . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . so , the same MIDI file can result in two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can comp@@ ile up to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs you need a similar sound quality . in a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you also have control over everything .
that can happen if you have a binary form ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for instance by k@@ mid ; &apos; s home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
agree , therefore &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder that you want to add in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; select all the files , and drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
in advance , activate the automatic adjustment to the collection . otherwise , the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can call the arrow button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD , to slow down the playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o .
I have an &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; if I wish to play a kar@@ aoke file ( if I would like to play a kar@@ aoke file ) , or if I wish to play a file , merely go to the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window switch and select the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
if you want to listen to a file just as soon as you want to add them to a collection , turn off the setting up to a collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection . open from files
supp@@ ose you have downloaded the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. , you just want to play the first file . thus , you will set the setting up automatic to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection , then just this one MIDI file .
then connect B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid to play and create a collection of all three files . how do you do it ?
these people have sent MIDI files or postcards . all thank you ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ate me , continue to program &amp; k@@ mid ;
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I wrote in the third year , so that I &apos;m not much time to take for my hob@@ bies but I tried to collect MIDI files , music and phr@@ ases .
if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you simply want to make me happy , write an e @-@ mail : lar@@ a @ k@@ de.@@ org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really do a huge surprise when you send me a postcard from your home or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all who want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , but you should receive a MIDI file , but you should contact me because I might have the file .
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my free time and ro@@ oted by no man &apos;s money . I therefore want to program that I can only be programmed , because / if I get feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Keep the error that sound height was too high for AW@@ E cards .

and of course my thanks applies to all this excellent musicians in the net that give us the wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which can be found under h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ y@@ pink / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can watch the development , search and pictures . you can also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as sound quality depends on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same if you use a FM device or a AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card you need to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameters MO@@ DE _ DEM@@ O _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it starts as if you could have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; K@@ DE ; ma@@ iling lists or send an error ad@@ dic@@ ation directly to me .

the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . there &apos;s the window with the play@@ list . and finally , there is an information window that is displayed only when information is returned .
it is possible to assem@@ ble the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , you should use the category continuous play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hier@@ og@@ est@@ u@@ fe . if you get an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups are copied to the current Category and playback starts with the attached entry .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , television and continuous re@@ play@@ list can also be changed by direct E@@ ditions of XML files . of course , you can only do if &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; not running through an editor , but also through the application itself . by clicking on a sub@@ group , only the XML content is displayed only .
after changing XML files , you need to be chosen from the menu on the same with play@@ list and select either the processing mode , or another category can be selected .
all changes lost if the processing mode left or another group will be selected without paying the play@@ list .
following ease of convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can be switched on only by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation of starting and respon@@ dents can be disabled by editing from ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and Change of &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ serves option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be simply inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; you will notice the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / val@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / k@@ m@@ player / exc@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation of starting time does not need to be short , it will automatically end through the opening of another source . this would be , however , the user can finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; + / / home / K@@ oos : / / / home / K@@ oos ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; In list test / several examples of S@@ MIL which are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are supported .
there is a rider to the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog box of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here , the path of the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data flow from the network and other things can be set .
another tool for troub@@ les@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog box of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , such as the setup of the back@@ end by m@@ im@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module @-@ f@@ uss @-@ Mozilla is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be added to the special field of em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list .
thus the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module is used as a service provider for the M@@ ime type , / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file assignment of K@@ DE .
the con@@ quer@@ or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is in a consoles application to browse and follow error messages related to the charging of the browser module library . if no error occur , the back@@ end output is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
with this always a fixed back@@ end for a particular M@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this was determined ) , this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV maps , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured to used equipment and TV channels , the scanner can be used manually from the configuration dialog box or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data rec@@ orders ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog box is detected in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be selected port where one can be selected ( e.g. , PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably won a DVB in it .
since the V@@ DR support for k@@ m@@ player can use only X@@ Video , it should also work on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . this reason why the video for@@ lin@@ ux extension is supported for the X server . therefore , the video for@@ lin@@ ux extension has to be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally are used by KM@@ Player for the sources of different names . at the time of emergence of this documentation , dv@@ d@@ source , source , ec@@ lip@@ sing , t@@ v@@ ring , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ ren@@ source . if they are activated , they start playing play@@ list .
there are indications like I can easily make my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from him ( not by the VCD : / / ) ?
Yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom is as user root according to the integration of the device . absolutely sure to make sure / dev / c@@ drom on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts only slowly , why must I test my CPU to their performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ hol@@ . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time to check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is required for comp@@ ile of &amp; ile ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to set back on the package &amp; tex@@ ex ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be used in the &amp; Linux system . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; c@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; c@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these enable a simple installation without further comp@@ ile and are included on the k@@ ile ; website .
this manual is suitable for everyone - independent of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users need not to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation is taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact about the k@@ ile ; website should be manufactured .
any questions regarding or comp@@ ile up &amp; c@@ ile ; on or are extensions desired , this should be addressed on the mail@@ ing @-@ list k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ environment for the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ floor space . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ functions . furthermore , the possibility to complete , comp@@ ile , editing and troub@@ les@@ hooting within the source text as well as transformation tools for this . finally , the easy to use assistant , the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his ways to learn to know the manual of Kate &apos;s user . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can begin there directly with the reading of the chapter by editor of &amp; Kate .
for r &amp; Lat@@ ex , the original language : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . is the original language : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . you can also use a La@@ ie ( English L@@ ay ) &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used to keep it out of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
there is not only a good colour view to &amp; Lat@@ ex ; it is not the ultimate book for this . by &amp; Lat@@ ex ; right @-@ rule can be used , good volumes , such as H. Kop@@ y , A Guide to &amp; Lat@@ ex ; : Document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
just like other expres@@ sions include &amp; Lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with the gener@@ alized properties such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text gr@@ it with the text . the introduction of at least the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class , which begins with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { Document } and must be closed with the command \ \ in { Document } .
the quick @-@ level assistant to &amp; k@@ ile ; is a great deal for the quick creation of a document in &amp; styles ; the selection of the assistant ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some cre@@ denti@@ als for the creation of the document . there are also some of the document related settings .
document classes : hereby , this is the type of document to create document : articles ( s ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; book &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ ying &#93; , projector &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or Custom .
coding : this is set to set the character encoding . modern systems use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . best if necessary , it should be UTF @-@ 8x ( for correct handling of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used par@@ quet for r &amp; Lat@@ ex ; for mounting the connection , they are only available in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the Docum@@ ent@@ ele of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( in compliance with German DIN regulations ) should always be used in preparation of German texts .
new users are now not wor@@ ried anymore . it is just a short description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - as well as other source code editors - the approach used for commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . however , you should not be sure that your mathematical environment has not been closed . however , it will be sure that your mathematical environment has not been closed due to the modest appearance of the output file . however , you will be able to save you by the up@@ time period and time .
with automatic completion of the environments ( eg . \ \ Beg@@ in { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates a spaces ( for input of the text ) and the da@@ w@@ ed line to close the command ( eg . \ \ , { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually divided into several elements . &amp; Lat@@ ex ; encourage the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most common and sub@@ tle element ) :
when view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective right click .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful with the creation of your own &amp; lat@@ ex . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; straight file ) is created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; through one click with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer on the appropriate line in the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ Source text .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format document and also other information as the font type and is besides PDF the detailed output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , conversion and printing of DVI ; files for various systems and devices .
when using the R@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ye search , the elements of DVI ; file has been clicked on an element in the DVI ; file would be clicked on the exact opposite of it . once upon a section in the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ Source click here , is used for the respective section in DVI ; -@@ viewing calls .
Master @-@ Document : this function will be used with several files . with a master document , the work is simplified with others .@@ tex files . when using a project a project can be set to project projectors project .
quick construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code will be compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless otherwise agreed in the source text ) .
file size : in this mode , the DVI ; file on a well @-@ awak@@ ening â s . it &apos;s not a call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick installation .
in consideration of the Edit tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be found . the first selection field was developed for quick integration of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The promised &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection field Further is for example of articles such as tags , joints , according to notes or references .
name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or different element is created .
regarding : is used for reference to a specified name ( select a selection box ) .
when using quot@@ ation , a selection list is displayed with literary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are necessary only if the file is necessary . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand written .
the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ . it is used for determining the font . it can be set for the main text , which are attached to Fu@@ essen , etc . there are the following documents :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; there are two selection criteria for creating a new document by selecting the document type and legend of the settings . 2 . the document may be written by reason of this document .
the brackets after the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the font is fixed . the font is fixed not at the beginning , can this also happen in the text .
once the above source code was entered the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text is compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way to this is the use of building construction or the buttons .
the source code must be stored in front of the comp@@ ile . &amp; ile ; for saving the storage automatically .
the compilation of the document should be searched for errors after the errors . when using quick installation and ey@@ epi@@ ece , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the protocol should not be observed .
a environment ( English environment ) is a text that is treated differently compared to the rest of the rest . the command \ \ Beg@@ in { Environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ Change { Environment } , and \ \ Change { The \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
the resulting changes will be accepted only within the area ( from \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } to \ \ ( environment } ) . there are no sh@@ ame@@ proof ( number ) for those in an area .
there are many powers to increase the read@@ ability and us@@ ability of the document . for example , certain fonts , fat pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . , these commands are either end with the command \ \ or automatically and automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ Beg@@ in { emp@@ h } : this command is available for cour@@ ier and is long as long as he is closed with a \ \ &apos; { emp@@ h } or another environment . single word in a set can be displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { Word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : created a quote in the document . quot@@ ation starts with \ \ Beg@@ in { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ Change { Qu@@ ote } .
after the background to write the source tex@@ tual with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; drawing language is displayed , follows a step @-@ for @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; styles ;
once in the assistant , a little text was entered , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be completed . in this case , a quote , a few places in fat and cour@@ ier , and a po@@ em to apply to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , may be returned to the editor by editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E ( at the internal viewer ) . in an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI ; file created , the document may print or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try and fun .
DVI ; is a straight file format ( English D e V ice I n@@ b ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for reading of some drivers from the computer . there are many different types of the .@@ d@@ vi Edition , such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conversion or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . on the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can be printed ( if the printer is set properly ) .
the tool@@ bar is converting the conversion of DVI ; file in other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; file source can be created , the conversion can start in different formats by using the button bar in the tool@@ bar .
the preliminary search ad@@ ore the direct jump from the editor to da@@ w@@ ed position within DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers an appropriate setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ binding files . for this purpose , only Modern under settings can be set up ... Tools building balanced .
the mouse has to be positioned in a line of source tex@@ tual and close to prec@@ inct in the source of the source . the jump on the appropriate spot in DVI ; viewer is then placed .
with this feature in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; ile ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document must be defined as text editor ( setting up ey@@ epi@@ ece settings ... Editor )
should the use of quick installation of the &amp; DVI ; viewer cannot be specified . if an error occurred , this is reflected in the log file or the message window .
the log file extension refers to the source code in the source code . in the editor you can see the error message from the errors inside the error . the log file must be clicked on the error in the log file must be clicked on the error in the log file , navigating immediately to the error line .
once upon the respective button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the selected template for the document . the pre @-@ set features are :
for selecting from empty document , a document may be written either by reason to new or the assistant to creating a new document . further information is included in the section .
H@@ Ã ¤ frequent users of &amp; Lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates are created in &amp; c@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / Lat@@ ex ; file can be created or create a new file . &amp; c@@ ile ; can create a new template by means of an existing document and selection of file template documents ... create .
when creating a new document from a presentation using the New document , some character strings replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables are set to settings in settings ... settings General will be set .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know what character strings will be replaced by which variables are :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document type . typically , it is used by entering a document type : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; {
the eas@@ iest way to create a template is the use of the assist@@ ants and the associated entry for commands in the Editor . once the document has been completed in the following steps :
when creating a new document , its own presentation will then be more balanced instead of the standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created . will be used to create a template for creating a template , should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; Kate ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for reading of reading and herr@@ ing from many different kinds of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for the menu can be made directly from &amp; styles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and to learn its powers , the manual should be attracted to Kate . user of &amp; Fitness ; you can get there directly with the reading of the chapter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Editor &apos;s chapter &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called for the volume of La@@ Te@@ X reference . you can find an outstanding description almost all commands that are available in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; you can find it as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click navig@@ ator button to w@@ it the &amp; tex ; word to w@@ ishing you to select \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ etc .
when pulling the text with bent left mouse button , the selected text will be copied automatically into the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with a touch of the switch , you can open parts of the source tex@@ tual in the editorial window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; it has the most diverse types of source tex@@ tures to browse and emphas@@ ize it . for example , the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands differ from the normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants are imag@@ ery among the text . this is an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu is highlighted the jump to n@@ igh@@ ts@@ or last j@@ umping stamp . this is also highlighted that they will automatically get this spr@@ int mark on the first input of a character .
the Edit is probably one of the main aspect of using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; although &amp; Kate ; already offers great powers , such as &amp; lat@@ ex ; source texts for their selection . &amp; Lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . under editing are the following commands for the text selection :
w@@ asting a complete set ( group of lines , containing on both sides a blank line ) . this extended meaning has been described by using tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; statements and all other lines of source text . this is this extended cause in &amp; k@@ ile ; it is therefore that the units are separated by two empty lines .
you have the word among the current cur@@ sor position . this is also an extended meaning , since this command is also &amp; lat@@ ex ; orders with a good colour ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
for example , a part of the document can be removed from the key . &amp; Kate ; offers the key source of the key . &amp; Fitness ; offers with its commands for a faster load . under editing the following commands are included in the text :
the definition for a sub@@ section in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description to edit out@@ breaks .
it was already clear that environments can play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders placed in the environment for a m@@ Ã ¶ st simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly before the order to open the surroundings .
with this command , at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the area .
if the cur@@ sor is before or within the command \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } , is used at the end of the area ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
in the input of many spar@@ ed environmental commands , you can recover quickly the big view . this command is close to the last open environment , so that the w@@ asted ambient structure is not quar@@ rel .
&amp; c@@ ile ; also special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups that are determined by cl@@ amps { ... } are some important commands that correspond to the surrounding area .
this command will be at the beginning of the current group convers@@ ations ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the welded bracket .
with this command , at the end of the current group convers@@ ations ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cl@@ amped cl@@ amps .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the welded cl@@ amps of a &amp; tex ; group # is , at the other end of the group convers@@ ations ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
for the input of many missing groups cl@@ amps , this command can be lost quickly out of the opinion . this command lay down the last open group , so that the gro@@ ove structure of the &amp; tex ; groups cannot be used .
in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; two simple signs are used as a par@@ cel . for the end of the purpose , the sign is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; this case knows this case and for two close signs for signs for &amp; lat@@ ex .

some user records the columns in tables -@@ environments and all the E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) tries to encourage one another . although this tab@@ ulator is not to be in@@ sufficient . although this tab is not the da@@ zz@@ ling , the columns is added to the current tab@@ ul@@ ators .
although &amp; Kate ; already a good source code has been installed , this in &amp; k@@ ile ; in order to include special commands ( mostly for business &amp; Lat@@ ex ; ) are still extended . all these modes are fully compatible with settings . all these modes are set aside for different ways under settings .
in the beginning a new environment using the command \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } is &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ to { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when the ring button is removed , the last letter of the input is removed and m@@ Ã ¶ en@@ vi@@ ed the list box . on the other hand , the list can also be smaller by entering a further letters .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , you can be found nat@@ u@@ ously in selection of a command . alternatively , you can get rid of these positions using the edit brands of N@@ Ã ¤ ic Spr@@ ung@@ brand , and that parameters will be frozen .
under the settings ; set up ... k@@ ile ; self @-@ alig@@ ned settings to these lists are made . there are different types of language lists for r &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as wre@@ cks of the general language use .
the command mode is used for the completion of environments not include . there are always a few letters with \ \ \ in order to be entered and the call of full @-@ loading mode is used as often as often used , that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for completion of the environments is used .
when calling the reference to the open period or the touch of the environment , the command is automatically controlled and it appears \ \ Beg@@ in . afterwards , the ambient temperature can be continued in the sim@@ pl@@ est way and terminated by wires the input .
after this is done , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is being opened .

for example , in accordance with the letter L , the letter L is entered and the mouse has been inserted , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X ( letter L ) .
big W@@ alls are not helpful . however , it was noted that many deser@@ ts are written in a document more than once . it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the completion of all already written f@@ ancy .

the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , probably have to do with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . thereby , the plug@@ in system is very powerful . you can do not wait until someone else can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; which can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; read more on below .
to install a plug@@ in or a box , we start with the menu plug@@ in . the following dialog will be opened :
this dialog allows to manage all the plug@@ ins to manage and add new products . we describe every &amp; GUI ; -@@ ELE@@ MENT :
here you can enter the search path . add plug@@ ins without a storage location &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often , several persons work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the speci@@ fying team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nic@@ kn@@ ame is the nickn@@ ame of the user and serves for unique identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leader and sub @-@ project leader .
the user can look out of the list of Team Members , who is it . this happens , by doing this team member from the list and the S@@ me@@ ar button . the currently selected member ( their identification ) appears after you are : text .
nickn@@ ame and adjustment of your own identity are important in terms of messages and ann@@ ot@@ ations . see further information about ann@@ ot@@ ations .
next to the overview of her team , there is another advantage through the members of the team : it can be created an event to the team manager if something is happening . see in further information .
event actions are actions to be carried out if something specific in the project is done , as much som@@ ebody else worked out , or the sending of a message if a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file into CV@@ S as soon as they will be added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog can be done , mach@@ ined and deleted .
an email is sent to the selected address data in the receiver list . the address may be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see , we@@ i such lad@@ der can be set up .
comments are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
notes to comment is simple . it can be selected either by the Note -@@ entry from the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary area followed by calls text .
ann@@ ot@@ ations can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickn@@ ame ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) is a role in the project consisting of the following possibilities : team manager Sub@@ project leader . according to the enrich@@ ing and sub @-@ project leaders , the corresponding series or sub @-@ project should be given , as shown in the following examples :
the nickn@@ ame and roles names are independent of large or small growth , but spaces around the cl@@ amps and the : make the comment inv@@ alid .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and form@@ att@@ ing languages supported by D@@ TD @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic and scripts .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for which can be found in .
the settings can be set up with settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog has a few pages which can be treated with each other .
the behaviour of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in regard to tags including car completion can be modified . the entries are :
large / Classi@@ fication of tags : large / small scale of automatic tags : large / small scale means that tags will be inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / Classi@@ fication of At@@ tri@@ bu@@ cks : large / Classi@@ fication of Autom@@ ated At@@ tri@@ bu@@ cks . normal large / small scale means , the attributes are added so added as described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional Tags automatically include : if requested , is optional for tags for which the closing day is optional , this is immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
not optional Tags automatically include : as above all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
start and conclusion @-@ day automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding closing date is changed and vice vers@@ a .
automatic Re@@ use of Acc@@ ent @-@ Sig@@ ns : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated signs in the corresponding coding during the insert .
M@@ ime types : m@@ im@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using the default standard , the standard pre @-@ plates can be restored .
standard character encoding : coding of newly created or in other ways when opening the file can be addressed ( where the coding of the file can be addressed ) , but this setting is now extinct from the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD uses for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD was not detected , but this setting is now extinct from the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a regularly backup copy that can be recovered with a power failure or crash during the next start of the program . this is not the same as the saving of the file . also for not stored documents , a backup is regularly produced , according to the set time produced .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in editorial area or own view ( or documentation in a cardboard box ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
set the window settings back to the next start is useful when the user interface has come through change of MDI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / dependent views through views of each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning messages can be used to change the display of war@@ nings by means of non @-@ questions .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it may display the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ isation behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source view in divided mode . for different modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the picture of the Par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , in details .
in the mouse click on the structure @-@ tree , the following action is possible to change the application by clicking the structure building with the mouse buttons .
in the scope of structure of the tree , the visibility of no@@ des in tree , the updating structure of the tree can be set automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are found in which the current document was found .
the area for removal of ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) , which are un@@ folded for more extensive text . ab@@ brevi@@ ations are in groups , each can give for several &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s means it can be a valid group for PHP , which means the if@@ el@@ ab@@ brevi@@ ation something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
plug @-@ ins can be managed here . plug @-@ ins are the third side of the third side , which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , at the most well @-@ known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; for inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following options must be noted :
address : the path to the plug@@ in , if it is not in a standard place like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / li@@ b .
input : this information will be delivered to the plug@@ in when you start , the current file can open the associated file ( path of current file ) or the Project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; download &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Only @-@ read &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in ref@@ uses the loading . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts refuse to charge if this option is not chosen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check @-@ in : if this is activated , testing &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct . then , if the plug@@ in is not available , then if the plug@@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the troub@@ les@@ hooting was completely redesigned . the support for the D@@ BG de@@ bug was discontinued , as well as the support for the D@@ BG de@@ bug . instead of which a deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in concept has been implemented , enabling various implem@@ entations about plug@@ ins .
currently only one plug@@ in is available , support for the use of &amp; g@@ ub@@ ed ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
the use of the deb@@ ug@@ ger for a project begins with the selection of a matching deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ ins in the project settings . in addition to the deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a project is activated by a deb@@ ug@@ ger , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; interface :
a view that is displayed in the content of monitored variables . appears normally in the left dock .
a view , in which all stops are listed , with line numbers and conditions . appears normally in the bottom dock .
a view that is shown in the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the deb@@ ug@@ gers . appears normally in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported features of the deb@@ ug@@ gers , everything or a part of the following functionality is available .
this action will be used for deb@@ ug@@ ger , if necessary , or it shares the plug@@ in with plug@@ ging on de@@ bug requirements . this action will be triggered by default if a project is opened , so that it should not be counted on a normal case .
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ ging session starts the session . includes connection to the deb@@ ug@@ ger or end the le@@ aking according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to manage a de@@ bug requirement . this is the same with the use of a browser to view the current document . the issue of this requirement is displayed in the de@@ bug issue .
shows the deb@@ ug@@ ger to start and inform@@ ing information about the monitored variables as well as the updated lines continuously . if this happens , while the script is started , the execution is started , the script will start with the requirement .
shows the deb@@ ug@@ ger to begin with the execution of the script , without inform@@ ing variables and the current line number . if this is done , the execution goes on . happens , the execution starts as soon as a request is placed .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger performs the next statement in script , without having to enter the functions or include files .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger performs the next statement in script , whereby if possible in functions and include error .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shows the deb@@ ug@@ ger to go to the statement , and to go to the next so there is not the current . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens a dialogue in which a variable or expression can be entered , the monitored value will be monitored in the variable image .
with this dialogue a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable .

document type Ed@@ iting Pack@@ ets ( D@@ T@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to provide support for marking and scripts . your simplicity and flexibility are made of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script files and the tool bar . day file include two file types , which include &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files are handmade , symbo@@ lic@@ ated by images and instructions faster in a document than one user might ever could .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s cannot be created ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see in details for converting .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files are then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bar . shortly , a &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Fe@@ at@@ u@@ dial@@ og@@ es , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; even . tool@@ bars provide a fast insert of tags in a document without any danger of a writing missing .
tag folders are nothing as a folder . you contain only the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of writing language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declare if they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so many users have a better insight and more information in working with them .
the following chapter describes any element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits will be displayed in a simple way .
this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains only one element type on itself nothing else .
the type of tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; a argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the Tag@@ typ class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the Type Method . returns the name of the class , where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common breath group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; Tag determin@@ es only element .
describes a attri@@ bute of a tags . this element can only indicate the name and type of attri@@ bute . additionally , there are further tags that describe how this attri@@ bute will be displayed &amp; etc ; This is an only element element .
specifies the source code for the attributes in tag editors and in the attri@@ bute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the source data .
source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . d@@ co@@ p &apos;s name is within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and methodology name . the arguments that are handed over to the method . can be empty , or % tag@@ on name , that means the name of the current tags .
a container day that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can only occur for an attri@@ bute description . it is an element type element .
specifies the position of the attributes of a tags within a Dialogue . this day can only occur for each attri@@ bute in a dialogue ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in a dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that occur within the defin@@ ing tags . this element is an only element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all day XML files must begin with an &amp; XML ; Declaration begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be sp@@ itted and closed properly .
spaces affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; B ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced . this will not be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to review the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog above is in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ window to start and checked Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . a further dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . currently , verification only takes place when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
in the following example of a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; -@@ ELE@@ MENT from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ ati@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; drawer @-@ function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; drive _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; option &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also pretty easy and there is a editor to be accessible via D@@ TD ; for a list of selectable &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; General &#93; Version = use 1 for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ TD ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional = The simplified name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is called Nic@@ kn@@ ame .
a action can set up with settings ... created . Click on New Action leads to the same dialog :
this promotion is assigned to this action . by clicking the button user can be assigned a button to be exchanged with K@@ einer is the current syn@@ onymous root .
the eas@@ iest actions . it can be entered into the detailed settings and in the execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document on the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this promotion , external applications can be started ( or parts of the document ) , which are started ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even are the quick start dialog or the various see in ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ EP@@ s .
the first must be the name of the script and interpre@@ ter . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are permitted , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ ile variable in command line : global script file : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts within your path : $ Path There are other special variable that can be used in command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the document . in case of a local document file : / from the document &apos;s name is removed .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; process replaces . if by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is going to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP is used to control &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the remote script is used .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us may be made to the standard input . in the selection box input can be determined , which is to be sent to default .
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally recommended only with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the amended application can be re@@ directed . there are two types output : normal output , which is specified on the default output . it can be noted , which is set to the default output document by default :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . in any case it is not too many , so you can create a tool bar with the name of the market .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add actions to configure and configure your settings .
parts of this window are fairly self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom end of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all necessary fields and add the day to the appropriate tool bar .
complete everything and if the At@@ tri@@ butes has and you are planning to edit the &quot; tag &quot; tag if available , hence an input when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is it a bad symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? if we replace difficulties before we have difficulties .
for creating a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; choose from the &amp; k@@ menu ; graphics further programs ( or where else it is in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel standard , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to realize what the promotion does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ;
with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a starting button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as loose , star@@ ed , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message appears to be sign@@ alled , or should be ready to start reading this symbol ; starting a day in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it has to be connected to the action . this is done by the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of the desired action . in addition to the text field there is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue with other tags , so it &apos;s still available , or confirm with the OK button .
supp@@ ose you want to add some usual &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ functions to the tool bar , or it should make it possible to set up the tool@@ bar in several groups . make sure the tool bar can be selected via settings . make sure that the desired tool bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( very left ) for my tool bar . after selecting the element , which is to be added to the tool bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the element to the tool bar .
for example , I would like to preview an easy way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note , as the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone , who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar , could believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by means of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
secure in the correct folder . after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust their &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that your tool bar ( s ) is charged if a file is opened from the respective type .
maybe the most remarkable expansion of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the form@@ att@@ ing language that you are on love . this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; document @-@ tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ repository check whether someone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; -@@ language you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . let &apos;s first allow you to treat the second part .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c to you = path , relative to this file , e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements selected in the main index Top Element = # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 .
the visible section is defined by the visible section of documentation in the document @-@ tree . for example , see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so :
# K@@ DE config File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c you = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level Elements Top Element = PHP 4.2 Docum@@ entation = Table of contents , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = Basic syntax , ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this shows that it is about sub @-@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the chess technique ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out .
you notice that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent in the upper end of the building management &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but pay attention &amp; B ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ at@@ .@@ Be replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file which is used for creating a &amp; PHP ; script file for the m@@ ys@@ q@@ l _ fet@@ ch _ array _ function is to be displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text List ) and the file sharing links .
a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c save as well as $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( so you have to do this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that this well and value are shared , you will send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ repository . you will not be rich , but proud to be proud to work with the best web @-@ development platform .
with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to divide the resources ( D@@ T@@ EP packages , tool bar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or otherwise to whom are sent by email , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) with email messages , in context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archives , from where all the other &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ User may be checked and used only if our team needs them as accurate and useful for the publication . to deal with a full @-@ use contribution to which it guarantees a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the source of resources is ensured , both for our team and later users .
when up@@ loading you will be asked for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case you have to request several keys . in the dialog New resource you need to remain empty ( URL preview can stay empty ) and then click OK to upload the upload of OK .
the up@@ loading can also instantly upload the menu D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) , and in the context menu of files and folders on the templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , yet in front of the installation , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by testing of integrity and Sig@@ ni@@ hil@@ ation . if the integrity is given , and the resource is carefully signed , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages that is currently not yet supported by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; but the creation can be time consuming , because hundreds of day files can be needed in the tag@@ XML format . there is the simpler way to convert a D@@ TD automatically into a D@@ T@@ EP package .
the conversion can be started by the D@@ TD shop and Conver@@ ting a D@@ TD . choose the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ TD description , which should be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
target record : the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; is written in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defin@@ itions : the string , die im ! doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / de@@ e.@@ dt@@ d should appear
fine adjustment of the D@@ T@@ EP after conversion : if enabled , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion of the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is recommended to use the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand these to understand and full benefit from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; we must first make these concepts about these concepts , without their understanding &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little use br@@ ils .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the work area is divided into three areas : global , locally and projects . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
global elements are available for each , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses , available . of tool aff@@ ecting transactions is stored , in the joint Ord@@ in@@ gement of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators different tool bar , actions and samples in a global tree that will then be available in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements provide a personal collection of web @-@ developers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; designs up to tool bars with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all the elements are stored in the folder &apos;s folder and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ MDI ; consists of some main areas : the editorial window , building views , the boxes with information and tool@@ bars . please beat in , and for further information about these areas .
you can click the ant@@ it@@ re@@ iter with the right mouse button , to get a context menu with the current document appropriate entries , as close to the current , other or any ant@@ it@@ re@@ iter , new , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to present the current document .
right click on the editorial area lead to another context menu regarding the processed document , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / insert ) , editing the mouse under the mouse , or opening the file if the string is under the mouse hand a file .
at the top end of the editorial master , the monitor sets of the monitor . currently , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional will be shown as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further development of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the tool bar will be adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
the use of tool bar is really easy . if they want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; in their document then click on the tag that same day . if you wish to insert the data for this straight day . if you wish to add multiple attributes ( as anchor ) , you can insert several attributes ( as anchor ) .
the installation views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate them to open and pier@@ ce . in the representation of boxes , project , patterns , documentary structure , scripts , attributes and documentation construction devices are available .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all the files in the project and allows the administrator of the files in the project by right mouse click . actions like adding , removing , up@@ loading or delete files from the storage medium can be performed using the context menu .
another option of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all options open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the respective user and templates in projects are only available in the project . more on templates is available .
here you can find information about the available script . the concept of integration in Global , Lok@@ al and Project can also be downloaded here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retri@@ eve the information available via the right mouse button . on the right mouse button , you can start the script , edit or send an email .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking with the links of an element name , the cur@@ sor will open on the position of the element . by right @-@ click of a Elem@@ entes , a list of commands will open in terms of navigation and collection of the tree .
this tree appears among other buildings . with it , you can change At@@ tri@@ butes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . this is able to change the contents of all available attributes with a few clicks .
here is the complete documentation for the web technology for your development . it may be downloaded documentation for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; document site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited and looked at project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two cart@@ ons at the bottom end of the window can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem windows .
this cartridge shows information about each in Qu@@ anta cl@@ amps . such as the D@@ TD used the current document and all modifications to D@@ TD .
this cardboard box shows all the errors inside the current document . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( so that gives ) in this window .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will show the corresponding command . the cho@@ col@@ ates of tool bar is the possibility to define his own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
another feature of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool bar with e@@ Mail . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool bar as compressed T@@ ar @-@ Archive by &amp; mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , you can secure this in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as any other guarantee and load !
it is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options to get to the custom script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and here are not executed .
if you have problems at starting &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path includes the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 bin folders . also , you should make sure that is no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in the Path from her bin folders . the same is for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; was optimized for a rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , began to deal with a close @-@ up idea ; what would be , if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , extended mark@@ up language editor would be ? well , this would be the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; is &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . together , if you can define it &amp; XML ; then it should be &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it should be &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it will be the suitable &amp; IDE .
well , to the af@@ o@@ rem@@ enti@@ oned claim must be held that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; K@@ DE ; report is not only possible to expand things , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as to expand , as they need it for their need .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; enables web @-@ developers to improve the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can extend the productivity almost every task . by using the program Kom@@ som@@ ers@@ A &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; extend , without any script you can notice to understand a script ( more about it in . )
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly developed into a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; associated developers left the G@@ PL license version and produced a commercial program .

this should create a help according to the mouse button , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; support development in financial form , please find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed in the top of the project , e.g. after filling the project called the entire directory structure for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is automatically filled .
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ cam@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can connect the server address of the machine to which you want to access the local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0.0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if one can be empty this field , the default settings of the chosen protocol are used . depending on the remote computer , it could be a custom@@ ization .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and standard templates . if a common collection of files can be used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standards .
this is the folder where the tool bar can be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files for different projects is used , this folder should be set instead of the standards .
this allows to insert files from local file system into the project . several files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great when you have static web content that you want to download and change . at ser@@ ver@@ ance scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you need to proceed differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let the files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project will be embedded in the main folder of the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this option , all files and folders will be displayed inside the main folder and you can take a precise selection according to land@@ marks .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by means or , by removing the boxes , cl@@ amps out of the project .
the last screen of the new project assist@@ ants contains three settings that can simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be used in the menu with Project Properties in the menu dialog , or with the short@@ cut shift Shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder possible ) , which will be re @-@ related to project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
supplementary option to top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or are excluded from the project .
the project management , which is loaded when opening the project . can be read more about the project prospects .
with this , the desired deb@@ ug@@ ger can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be adjusted in . the deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in can be configured with the check@@ box options . in this case the troub@@ les@@ hooting can be described .
in the sub @-@ window profiles , high loading profiles ( see in ) can be set as well as the display of a building view for the content of the server for each profile , by poin@@ ter an own building view of each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a ma@@ iling list . see details in details .
in the sub @-@ window event configuration , the event can switch and delete these actions , change or delete . event actions will be executed if an earlier event happens , as the sick@@ le of a file . see in details .
by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project that was opened . this behavior is currently not influence .
to open a different project , select Project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the project is open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us is closed , the project file will be stored automatically . you are asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you invite a new project .
the project management offers free access to the files in the project . there may be the files within the current project .
folder is similarly , but missing the entries opening and open ... in the right mouse button Open menu :
here you can view various profiles . the profile contains information about the place of uploaded files . see .
enables the removal of the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will end up to remove the removal .
the password will keep in the core memory and forget it . this possibility is useful if you need to upload files to files and save the rather un@@ safe password on the disk . option is not listed in question .
that will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high la@@ vers are created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to various servers . during editing or creation of a profile , this dialog will appear :
this is the name of the server to be copied to files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address work .
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and the installed K@@ io slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator operates a service not on the usual port .
depending on your attack shaft this is either a tim@@ es@@ aving function or a risk . if the password will be stored on the plate , so it can &apos;t be read easily , but everyone can see with programming language .
a project view is only one set of files and tools . it can be loaded in a project many views , that means that you can load different files and tool bars , and replace the currently un@@ opened files and machine tools .
views can be opened in the menu or the Project tool bar , accessible via settings tool bar tool@@ bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to your own work@@ piece .
as mentioned above , tool bar in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best over the menu tool bar can be stacked . using and add tool bar will be treated below in the section adding tool bars .
the tool bar and symbols may be set either by means of context menu ( right click on the tool bar ) , in which the new tool@@ bar can be set , which can be set in the dialog , where can be specified where actions can be visible on this or other tool@@ bar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool bar , additionally the entries will remove the entries and action that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool bar and the actions of them can set up in the menu with settings ... and set adjustments to set .
templates are used in key docum@@ ent@@ aries , code @-@ es@@ cal@@ el and files to link . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used templates , as a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , shift or any of the system existing directory within the front @-@ tree . templates have in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you can imagine to the file system .
some with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions on the beginning of every template .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can be added any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are normally added in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples will be available in the template @-@ tree under global templates . additional information on templates tree is available .
documents can be created by any text type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , a simple report for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in an appropriate way to be efficiently . some examples may be found in the coverage of global templates . see for more information on templates .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted on a template but the same text area should always be inserted into documents . you can find everything from a comment via a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl . some examples are available in the ball@@ room under global templates . see for more information on templates .
as the name says that this templates serve for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents that can be arranged in a folder t@@ inc@@ ture , in a compressed t@@ ar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
design a document &apos;s structure to Bel@@ i@@ eben ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select file as template save as local template ....
as soon as the result is , note that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . check out in the repository under project templates .
in your document , select text in your document and save as template as template . alternatively , you can store your selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be pulled with pulling on the template templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only copy in a copy folder . all file management functions can be used , such as pulling and insert or insert on the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can create and create a name in the file format or in the project files , select a name for the template and secure . by default , the project folder is secured , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates allow a very targeted way @-@ oriented approach . you can create head@@ lines and foot@@ lines , or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create files insert or linked with them . additionally , you can keep some things when using templates in projects very deep in the eye .
the template structure in the sub@@ window template is based on the files in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as shown above .
in order to define the behaviour of a folder , click the folder with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties menu on the folder . the following dialog appears :
a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is b@@ lown off , as soon as usual attributes .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except for the stem folders , except they would be explicitly enabled , except they would be explicitly enabled . in case of normal folder it would be explicitly enabled , in case of a normal folder it appears , probably in a family folder .
allows for printed or printed text for templates within this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot lines for a specific project and allows copying files into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ lines a whole presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ lines .
in addition , in addition to context menu ( show the right mouse button ) you have a full command collection for adding folders or copy and add templates from one place to another .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source Editor , which are accessible via the menu View . the first mode replaces the source code by V@@ PL ; Editor and 2nd share the editorial window in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; Editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : it invites you to edit a document as a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and be saved in the source code editor , which are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document which contains &amp; PHP ; contains a small green symbol of the V@@ oh@@ and@@ rest@@ ation &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with V@@ PL ; Editor is not possible to edit it directly with V@@ PL ; there is no plans to change these behavi@@ ors .
the second mode works exactly as the first , except that at the same time , the cur@@ sor is displayed in the source editor and in V@@ PL ; Editor is both active and the cur@@ sor is active in the source code and in V@@ PL ; this mode is already active but transferred the cur@@ sor of the active cur@@ sor from a window to others , whereby the position will be retained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between V@@ PL ; Editor and the source editor can be adjusted via Settings ... According to choosing V@@ PL ; view you can automatically choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in the selection , the recommendation can be set automatically . in principle , the recommendation is automatically set to slow calcul@@ ator and a large pot for slow computer .
supp@@ ose you want to change the title of the website , so it is possible to select the list of invisible tags in work with V@@ PL ; Editor is also available , as soon as a new document is created with V@@ PL ; Editor is used to change the suspension of the suspension . so you can change the following :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. bu@@ zz@@ words for internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below or remov@@ es a key into the list , e.g. keywords on the column name and key@@ word keywords on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing the design of pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons below list or delete . a change on the list is possible exactly as with the met@@ a elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not yet supported .
it is possible to insert a external CSS style , by clicking on the file button and select the corresponding file .
the use of the cur@@ sor is like in a text processing , possible by reason with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor still holds . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted and deleted by using button or distances .
the inser@@ tion of tags will be made in the same way about the tool bar , as in the source editor , it is said to note that the inser@@ tion of tags will not be removed if an anchor day , en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed with text , any other ambient air will have to be removed .
some tools such as the tables assistant or the lists of the tables are disabled . they are later used in &amp; V@@ PL ; later , in this release the tables or lists can be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for investigation of styles . in contrast to other programs for sty@@ li@@ stic devices , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style can be pursued .

in this command , this command will be checked for a partial or whole agreement with a pre @-@ copy called QNAP ME or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template is right with every QNA@@ ME , which contains the string template .

there are many graphic tools for the same . why so &amp; cr@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain shortly , why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contributions had been revised and simultaneously corrected in many places . another programmer had changed much text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts in bringing together .
the program used by me showed me only the modified lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there was no hin@@ ts referring to the places where perhaps only the feeding had changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; cr@@ diff@@ 3 ; was able to display differences in row and changes to white characters . later , any quantity of more useful features were added .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , copy it into the clip@@ board and add it in one of the comparative window .
a function that made a lot of work was the same and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; cr@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way coh@@ ort is fully supported . this is useful when two persons can work independently of one piece co@@ de and changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to process the dis@@ solution of conflicts . in this editor , you can even edit the result . the screenshot shows three qu@@ ell files in combination :
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; assi@@ sts you also in the same and mer@@ ging complete folder . this screen photo shows &amp; cr@@ diff@@ 3 ; the folder will lead :
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is similar to the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check Ko@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no trouble does not change the influence . )
if a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates that the file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can use the t@@ ilt @-@ work by using only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
diffuse 3 Ord@@ inary 2 folder , folder 2 folder , diffuse , folder 3 folder , folder 3 folder , folder 3 folder .
the opening dialog allows manual repair of fil@@ en@@ ames , the selection via the file browser ( file ... ) or select a last open file from the list . opening dialog box , you don &apos;t need to specify the third file ; if you are empty the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences are performed with two files .
over the kno@@ b folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or mer@@ ging of folders will be selected , for B and C , however , is a folder , then uses &amp; diffuse 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ames from A into the two other folders .
when mer@@ ging is crossed , the input field is active and can be used . however , it is not necessarily necessary to define an output file . you can also do this step later when saving .
the set button opens up a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with the same / mer@@ ging .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; cr@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparative window . compared with , you can not select files , you can simply beat the dialog with the reset button .
you can also use drag and store : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall over a comparative window .
what thought is behind ? sometimes it contains a file such as several similar functions . if you want to find out what these features are , you would like to download them in &amp; diff@@ 3 ; download and compare it . now you can easily compare the relevant sections , then add them and then compare .
note : at the moment you can find nothing out of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; only the case can be supported by text in a comparative window .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the pulling and put text into another program as a cut and insert ( instead of copying and insert ) . in such case , your original data could perish .
in the upper part of each Text window is the info @-@ line . the info @-@ line contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( please note that the mouse has a file for long , let the mouse rest a while on the line . then a small assistance window will display the full name . )
the three source code are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed over the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , you can see in the color which file differs . if both files are different , the default color is particularly useful when you compare three files . that is good in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) good .
left next to the text is the summar@@ ize column . if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see the relevant changes only in character strings and comments , for the pre@@ processing unit and in few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line , which separates the abstra@@ cts of the text , is interrupted in the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line shift is activated , the line is indicated in broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparative windows ) also has a info @-@ line with the inscription : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; encoder &#93; if you have processed the result . usually , it contains the automatic mer@@ ging already text , but often also contains conflicts .
! ! ! to all conflicts has been dissolved , the store is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons Spr@@ inge to next dissolved / un@@ solved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparative windows are used , each difference is to be replaced by a conflict at the same time .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group will be displayed in all windows and the first row of the group will be displayed , where the current group is otherwise visible . ) This group will then be highlighted by color background colour and on the left hand a black beams .
sometimes , by automatic mer@@ ging or by manual edit , no further line remains in the group ; then , in these lines of text &amp; lt ; there is only one plac@@ eholder for the case that you may change your opinion , and maybe again a different source . this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a marking which you may copy and then add differently .
the text reads ; it appears in the clip@@ board ; however , in the clip@@ board , if you copy such a text from the result window , go carefully with this function .
note : if you select the options listed below or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
this will navigate with the image aff@@ ord and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the window , you can use the arrow keys on the right , end , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Start and C@@ tr@@ l @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . the over@@ load column can also be used by clicking on navigation .
in the eye window , you can also use the other keys to edit . with the insert button you can switch between insert and transfer mode . ( pre@@ set is the insert mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ izing columns syn@@ cs the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective Group ( as already defined in paragraph and the ed@@ itable output window ) .
the tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture down@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture down@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , all non @-@ dissolved conflicts has to be seen as a conflict . therefore , between dissolved and un@@ solved conflict must be distinguished .
in order to copy the marking into the clip@@ board , you need to copy the copying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l insert ) . if this option is enabled , automatically copying them into the clip@@ board and carefully copy the manual copying . be careful with this option , because you could see the contents of the clip@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ings are stored according to the underlying operating system . UNIX variants use a line pre @-@ rack \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 ret@@ ains the line @-@ up of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; diff@@ 3 ; also not with binary files .
the options and list of the last used files will be saved automatically and re @-@ produced during the next start . ( menu entry &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup )
select a script with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog provides fonts with variable width to choose from , you should not use it . )
if you activate this option , differences in recur@@ sive let@@ tering are represented . if the chosen Scrip@@ tures cannot be supported , nothing happens .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in its pure form , but would be rendered straight . on these systems , the button pre@@ ferences automatically introduces an un@@ just colour .
if this option is enabled , when pressing the tab button , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted . otherwise , an tab character is inserted .
if you input or return , the incoming line will be automatically used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , your selection will be automatically copied to clip@@ board . manual copying into the clip@@ board .
you can select which line type you prefer to store . the default value is the most common selection on the operating system used .
in the same way files tries &amp; cr@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all fully identical lines will be ig@@ no@@ red . during this first step , white characters can be ig@@ no@@ red . the second step is not ig@@ no@@ red . in this step white characters are not ig@@ no@@ red . even in combination , white characters are not ig@@ no@@ red .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a car folder &apos; \ \ &apos; and a line @-@ up &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then could not save files with different sizes in side @-@ side @-@ side comparison , but like a white character . during mer@@ ging , this option must be disabled . in default this option is disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ig@@ no@@ red . in the result the differences are nevertheless displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
the default setting is disabled in the default . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
inten@@ sely after even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly at very large files .
in the automatic start @-@ up mode , this setting , as long as the result of the selection will be displayed , before the next un@@ solved conflict will continue .
automatically det@@ ects all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as a source . ( default it is useful if white characters occur in many files . if you have only access the functions of elec@@ ts A / B / C for all un@@ loaded white conflicts , if the options are ig@@ no@@ red or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments are activated .
these options are given in the chapter on scanning of folders and implementing a merge operation . look for details under documentation to the directory comparison and merge tracking .
if a file is stored , and an older version exists , then the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original file , if already a backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original exists , it will be deleted without a further backup .
adap@@ ts to the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you have to finish and re@@ boot , so that the change is active . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version by &amp; cr@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set global over the control centre . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you use this option , it is used for all entries the top setting .
over the selection fields for the coding is a short notice of what the local coding is . ( this can not be changed here and has some inform@@ al character . )
custom@@ ize the file coding for source files . this influences how special characters can be handled and interpre@@ ting . as the coding for each file can be individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can define which encoding is to be used .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your codec . ( for example , your files can be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the command command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can define the coding of the output command properties .
switch on this to supp@@ ress the change of changes in white characters in the text or over@@ sight . ( note : this applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ig@@ no@@ red or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments are enabled . )
this selection is available only if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences in a coloured coded over@@ load column are displayed . however , you might want to see only the differences between two of three files ; -@@ s ; B , A &amp; B ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; B ; -@@ C is displayed in addition to the normal still a second over@@ load column with the required information .
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply put the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
it provides the comparison between each other or another . this may also be useful for ads of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu ) .
sometimes you consider the differences and decide to comp@@ ose the files in the merge menu , even if you use only two files . a simple click starts to rest@@ art the file name as pre@@ set name for the output file . ( if this function is used to rest@@ art the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will first pass on this external command . in &amp; diff@@ 3 ; it will then write the output of the command , and not the file itself . you can write your own label , which is exactly according to your requirements . for example , they can use this function , or for correct parts .
when reading a file , it will first pass on this external command . if also a normal pre @-@ processing command was given ( see above ) , the issue of the command is just used . you can write your own label , which corresponds to exactly your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind that user is more flexibility when adjusting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users want to program itself . however , the good news is that in most cases SE@@ D or Perl are completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for entry into large letters : SE@@ D &apos;@@ B / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CV@@ S and other ver@@ sion@@ ing systems use some key words to insert character strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word Sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with SE@@ D , you may need to understand it and perhaps do you like this regular expres@@ sions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ig@@ no@@ res of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ usion . but it is good as an example of a further pre @-@ processing command for line spac@@ ing . SE@@ D &apos;@@ s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a suitable matches , and any hits will be replaced by nothing , so it &apos;s deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several conditions at one time . then , you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the propositions . example :
instead of SE@@ D you can also use something like Perl . Perl -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switches &apos; aller@@ dings are needed with Perl . where SE@@ D \ \ ( and \ \ ) are needed ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
data after the normal pre@@ processing unit will retain for display and merge . further operations change only the data that sees the line tri@@ po@@ is@@ th@@ mus .
note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre @-@ processing unit , the line equ@@ ates equ@@ ates the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences , you can &apos;t notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often you have to edit programmers in a folder many files . for this reason you can compare and assem@@ ble complete folder .
... make a suggest@@ ion for each object ; you can adjust the suggest@@ ion before the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate and sim@@ ulate the sim@@ ulated changes , without it really do it ,
... exec@@ utes selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the same and mer@@ ging of individual files . you have to specify only folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a basis . if no target folder was specified , uses &amp; diffuse 3 ; folder 3 as target folders .
note that only the comparison of folders will not start to carry the merge operation , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow )
during the reading of the folder you will be informed a small news window over the current progress . if you cancel the folder , only the files listed , which were compared to the time .
when scanning the folder is completed , shows &amp; cr@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list of listing with results on the left side , ...
each file and any folder of the scan found during the scan , will be displayed in a tree here . you can select an object with a single mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded , by clicking on the + / - click on the + / - click on the folder / right . the directory menu contains two features All sub@@ directories can be folded and all sub@@ directories can be folded to which you can un@@ fold or replace them .
if you double click on a file , the file is rest@@ art@@ ed and it appears a comparative window .
the icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . in such a case , the coh@@ ort @-@ action can be set automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as shown in the above picture , the colors are red , green , yellow and black .
in identical entries the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folder will be regarded as identical if the whole content is identical . then , folders also have the same color . at folders , the age is un@@ considerable for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colors are reflected the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes red and later when it is old , red will be red .
... A and C identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C identical but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C not have the same file type ( e.g. if A folder and B is a file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory data types . as long as such error objects exist , cannot be started .
... A and B does not have the same file type ( e.g. if A folder and B is a file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory data types . as long as such error objects exist , cannot be started .
the mode for synchron@@ ize is active , if only two folders and no explicitly specified target folder , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then cho@@ oses &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical , so that both folders are identical . if you have an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : assem@@ ble and save the result into both folders . ( the user looks as a visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; directly after mer@@ ging copies &amp; cr@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders will be compiled and select the new file instead of merge operation ( un@@ safe ) , but the same date appears , but the same date appears , but the date is identical .. solo such errors can not be started , the merge can not be started .
during mer@@ ging a file is working after the other . you show status column , if the merge was successful , and according to other messages , if something un@@ wanted is completed , you should take a final review and see whether the status is everywhere in order .
if in setup dialog , the file @-@ comparative method is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ mon@@ ast@@ eries , dissolved , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ dered conflicts is displayed only when three folders can be compared or merged . )
you can connect either to the selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) or any entries once . if you have selected all inter@@ c@@ hr actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can launch the merge .
please note : if you have no destination folder , then , in three @-@ folder comp@@ ile mode , C is used as destination where two @-@ folder mer@@ ging will be chosen as the goal and used to synchron@@ ize A and / or B as target .
if you select a destination folder , please check whether all entries must be in the target folder , also in the folder name , there are some options to avoid un@@ pleasant sur@@ prises :
to assem@@ ble all entries : choose directories / continue in the menu menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key pendant ) . in order to assem@@ ble the current entry , select the action of the current element or press the F6 .
if the contra@@ dic@@ tory data types still exists , a message appears to occur on the faul@@ ty elements . you can select a valid promotion for them .
if you want to assem@@ ble all entries , a dialog window appears with the options execute , sim@@ ulate and break .
select Sim@@ ulate if you would like to see what would happen without the really changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; then exec@@ utes certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge of a single file ) , then a mer@@ ging window ( please note the screenshot ) .
if you are finished with a file , select / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you don &apos;t have saved others , an appropriate dialog appears . then leads &amp; cr@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; cr@@ diff@@ 3 ; on an error occurred , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you can try to try the cause of the problem . if you have the opportunity to try to select the cause of the problem , or to solve the problem of the problem before you proceed with the merge .
if some entries were compiled individually , all entries ( in the current session ) and lead them together in later . even if the merge result was not stored or not saved , these entries will be done as done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; Cool@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ usion ... ) now has a section called directory inter@@ ferences with these options :
only files that are set on the indicated design are displayed in the element @-@ tree . separate patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default value is * . folder must not match this pattern .
files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
ign@@ ore files that are also ig@@ no@@ red by CV@@ S . many autonomous files are ig@@ no@@ red by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ signal file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a default file attri@@ bute . in other file systems it marks a leading score . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
for links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic checks are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated by default .
when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared , if the option is switched on . if the option is switched on , the links like normal folders will lead and recur@@ sively searched it . ( notice that this option would lead to a final grin@@ der and cr@@ ashes 3 ; ) This option is shut down in the default .
a complete analysis of any file through and shows the statistics of columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ mon@@ ast@@ eries , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than an easy binary analysis , and much slower , if they are applied to files that contain no text . ( enter an essential anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large files through a slow network , it may be faster , just the notice date and the file size you will need a certain level of safety . please use cau@@ tion . this option is activated in the default setting .
similar to confidenti@@ ality date . there will be no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal to . that can be useful when copying the date of change . please be careful with cau@@ tion . this option is activated in the default setting .
activ@@ ates the synchron@@ ize mode when two folders , and no target folder was specified . in this mode , the proposals will be identical , so that both folders are identical . also the results are stored in both folders . this option is shut off in the default .
if there are differences , the copy of the newer file is being proposed as an action . ( this will be considered in@@ secure , because the other file is not changed too . you should check this option in any case . ) This option is shut off .
if a file or file is replaced by another or deleted file , the original version is renamed and get the extension .@@ original . if an old backup file is released with .@@ original expansion already exists , this is not only the mer@@ ging of individual files , not just the whole folder . this option is switched on .
normally , the folders @-@ merge results are visible to the mer@@ ging of individual files ; you can turn the window part with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to switch the window windows in the window menu and switch between directory and text windows between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file just using double click . nevertheless , there is a single file directly together , without the folder you need to merge without the merge command . once you can save the folder , the status will run together and the file will not merge again when you merge the folder .
this status is lost , however , if you read the directory again : directory menu : re@@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line is compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax for local files and folders . a few things you should note :
a path can be relatively und@@ ant . or .. included . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ king . ( # - &gt; % 23 , idle - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . there is a brief list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then there is always a file accepted as link target . ( FTP : , ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permission or change of change . therefore , the authorization or change of change is from the original . ( please note the option of confidence of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of the main purpose is currently the differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts always the built @-@ in differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . in order to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the Differ@@ ences and then choose In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally you need &amp; cr@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is used as a K@@ Part , it takes &amp; cr@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from a patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the con@@ quer@@ or you can select a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that the original file does not work if you have changed the original files since generation of a patch file .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as Part 2 , it supports only the same of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the merge or the same folder is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now He@@ ist there are available ) . Moreover , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can comp@@ ile as the program diffuse 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I use G@@ PL programs already very long and I have learned a lot in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all the programmers running this way or to go to him .
you probably have compiled the program from the sources and it should not be notified to K@@ DE . in default , K@@ DE will not find resources for user interfaces ( e.g. , diffuse 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you can find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will be identical as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white characters is different , the line is not treated as the same . if , the next lines the next to Each Com@@ is co@@ stly but this is the case of the case .
the editor is noted for any difference in the files where he begins and where he ends . this important information is simply lost , if the result is simply stored as text file , and it is too much effort to create extra an own file format that could save this information .
the effort has been too large . you can always recover a specific version always by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to process larger amounts of text , an other editor should be used .
after the remove from text is suddenly lit ; no sr@@ c lin@@ ens ; appeared and the text can &apos;t be er@@ ased . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors for creating differences . even more approach would be conf@@ used and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and errors came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
in order to use all functions of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the homepage .
a list of the last changes will be found under h@@ tt@@ p : / / diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the Qu@@ ell package .
to comp@@ ile &amp; cr@@ diff@@ 3 ; comp@@ ile and install on a system with &amp; K@@ DE ; use the following command in the basic folder of the &amp; cr@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system , where K@@ DE is installed . if you are un@@ safe , you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
since &amp; diffuse 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any problems when comp@@ ile . should you need difficulties , report on the &amp; K@@ DE ; mail@@ ing@@ list of them .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift removing ) copies into the clip@@ board and delete the selected text . insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position and replaced the current marking .
only differences : files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the function on update . )
only entries are displayed , the differences are indicated that identical files are not included in the target folder . if the target folder does not contain these files , they are missing after the merge . ( the behaviour is probably changed in a later program version . ) This option is shut off .
note the buttons to choose the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group to the end of the selected group ( if they are not already available ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button .
in the default this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( e.g. &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ens ; shows a miniature show of all virtual work areas . it is quite practical to change the current programs on the desktop to stop her size , or to move them . this works both within a single work area as well as in several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ens ; can view all virtual work areas as well as in the ongoing applications . applications can be selected and even moves to work area and to other applications .
with the central mouse button , window can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ens ; the movement is possible both within a working area and also on other work@@ spaces .
the context menu depends on which the right mouse button is clicked on : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu has only clicked on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the text and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , on working area and end . the command will act the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window onto the full size of the desktop . appears only if on an application it was clicked .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only if it was clicked on an application .
if this check box is marked , you can move windows inside the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to be moved to other work@@ spaces .
when this field is crossed , in &amp; k@@ p@@ ens , the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
cross this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; view the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it can be crossed along with name , the name is provided with ordin@@ ator , &amp; eg ; 1st floor area .
if this field is crossed , the background will also be displayed as a background in the background .
if this field is crossed , the current programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; k@@ p@@ ens ; otherwise , the empty space will be shown to allow their selection .
here , the view of the program window will be selected . simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the propor@@ tions of the program window . icon displays the windows with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ens ; main window can be determined : classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ens ; in some other window managers ; in some other window managers , horizont@@ ally shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal position , especially well suited for the presentation at the side of the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ ature in the Control Panel . it has the advantage that it can change in size as symbols or with their content and move it out outside the control bar .
Click the right button of mouse within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent fitting of switch switches can set the dialog settings dialog .
at the moment , this is not changed in the dialog settings . you can do this manually in dialog :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or VI . if you have no write permission for the file , you have to register to your system administrator . in this file you have to pay the key win@@ dow@@ Transpar@@ ent@@ Mode 1 and to this a value . possible values are :
da &amp; k@@ p@@ ens ; part of the package base is , you need a functional installation of the K@@ DE base packages .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screenshot of a screen ; you can also use &amp; k@@ mag ; this application is interesting for several users : these include artists , web designers and people with a visual han@@ dicap . this documentation is to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag ;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly updated by new functions . it is optimised for use on more powerful computers .
if you like &amp; k@@ mag , a window appears as above . the main window of the screen . in the following will be displayed as a magni@@ fying window . the image , which is displayed in the magni@@ fying window , is an enlarged range of screen and is described in the following as a selection dialog .
in the default setting increases &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse will display like a mobile magni@@ fying . alternatively , you can set a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window ) or the surroundings of the mouse button at the screen level ( eg ; on the left screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse in the enlarged window , select the mouse click . please note , the &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the form of the mouse . this is always the standard K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t ; mouse hand .
in the selection window , you can adjust the select window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and buttons . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can capture the contents of the magni@@ fying edge . this goes also with the arrow keys .
if you additionally push the &amp; Shift ; button or remove the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the drop @-@ down window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the select window . note that the upper left corner of the drop point is fixed and only move the lower right corner .
&amp; k@@ mag ; owns a lot of functions . you can copy the enlarged image directly to the printer to insert into the clip@@ board ( to insert it later in other applications ) , the image film and much more .
starts or stop the update of the display . the stops of the update causes that the required CPU time is 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , H@@ och , Very high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a select window will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in one window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , opening a new window , printing , new@@ com@@ ades ( with the button document once again in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , Enlarge and cr@@ ushing &amp; etc ; .
k@@ icks also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; you can use &amp; c@@ magni@@ fier ; for this purpose you can use a magni@@ fier to enlarge the smaller printed in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for different people of benefits : from resear@@ ching or artist until web designers or visual handic@@ apped .
detailed user documentation can be done with help : / k@@ mag ( specify the URL to the address bar of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or start a help@@ center help : / k@@ mag ) .
&amp; magni@@ fier ; was developed by O@@ laf Schmidt oj@@ schmi@@ dt @ k@@ de.@@ org and Sar@@ ang Lak@@ are sar@@ ong @ us@@ ers@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net and Michael For@@ ster For@@ ster @ f@@ mi@@ .@@ uni @-@ pass@@ au@@ .de .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot . it is thought to help people who are suffering the RS@@ I syndrome ( rep@@ et@@ itive strain inhibit@@ ory syndrome ) and to which every mouse click pain is prepared .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot . it is thought to help people who em@@ ulate a mouse click pain . Moreover , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can cause the pain to use the mouse , and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can consult a physician because using your computer , you should consult a physician if this is not yet done .
in order to declare it once : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps prevent the mouse with the mouse , it is against pain which is caused by reason of mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all ergonomic support , the result can be imp@@ acted at any time .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitor your mouse moving and performs a mouse click , as soon as you break the movement short .
if the smart shift is activated , make &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break , after pressing the mouse button , move it until the end of the mouse is run . this way you can run the pulling in the mouse button . the smart shift requires a little practice , but you get rid of it quickly .
this temporary time has to hide after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click .
if it is enabled , it is enabled , the rotation speed will be set ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after shut@@ down the mouse button , if the mouse is left again , if there is no evidence due to the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is this function activated by clicking on the right and back , followed by a break , one click with the right mouse button . this moves will be saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; K@@ DE ; along with it , you can move the reaction time . open the &amp; k@@ control@@ center , go there sound &amp; multimedia , select the sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der sound buff@@ ers to reduce the response times .
if this setting is marked , will start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at every start of &amp; K@@ DE . this feature is currently only under &amp; K@@ DE ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments please contact the relevant documentation to the rate , as you will start a program automatically .
sets all the settings on the values given when opening the dialogue . you have already pressed the button on the user after the last pressing of the user .
best , use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the smart shift should first be disabled , you can then click on the automatic mouse , you can later push the smart shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response time of &amp; K@@ DE ; for sounds .
first you should make aware of which places a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that doesn &apos;t display no link , you can use the mouse on such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse is un@@ lock , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually pretty easy . the tri@@ ck is clean that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse , but also the rolls that get in touch with the mouse ball .
first , you must remove the mouse ball . as this happens , is from mouse to mouse . but it should be clear when you view the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are in the sides of the Lo@@ ches , into which the ball was inserted . the tri@@ ck and the pollution can scratch easily with a flat blade or sh@@ ing@@ ing gel .
in very rare situations the operating system performs the design of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just started the shift in this case , meaning that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool does not end the operation anymore due to the let@@ ting of the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use below another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem exists , that you can even run a mouse click . in this way , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be reset , and you can work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and continue the cur@@ sor at another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor up to place where you want to make it . so , if you don &apos;t want to bring the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you need a mouse button . safe zones for the mouse hand &amp; eg ; the grey faces around the tool bar and the cover lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent shift , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text .
the smart shift is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it needs its time before you can move it into the clip@@ board , and to bring it to any other action , in which you want to move the mouse with the pressing mouse button . but there will probably be a few advice . here are some advice :
do not use smart de@@ cks if you just start to start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; click on a mouse click on a right click and keep the Shift key , while you move the mouse button at the other end of the text and re@@ active there again the mouse button .
you can use the audi@@ ble mouse click . therefore , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button pressed a sound like a mouse click . so you can use the smart shift also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it needs some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; it should be installed in most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and a loudspeaker system and are set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; operated the mouse button as soon as the mouse hand har@@ med . this program has been developed for people suffering from the RS@@ I syndrome , and to which the firm of the Mau@@ le pain is prepared .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to be configured for a certain time , that a pulling process begins , before the mouse is left . in this way , the mouse can also be carried out and put off with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with the dum@@ b users can speak their computer for himself .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; you can set silent users the computer for himself . the user can choose from a list with the talk course sentences which are to be spoken once again .
on the first page of the assistant ( left screen photo ) , enter the command that will be used later for the language output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog .
on the second side , select the standard Text passage book . you can choose from the text pass@@ words , you can often select text pass@@ ages without them . the passages can be arranged of course .
on the third side ( right screen photo ) you determine the Dictionary for the Wor@@ ter@@ nal language . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can download the voc@@ abul@@ ary with a Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary . in addition , you can only agree correctly in the word of the word .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and includes essentially a input field for the key@@ ing@@ ing@@ ing@@ ay of your propositions ( the lower white field in the screen photo ) and a run memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screenshot ) .
if you register k@@ mouth , you can enter the propositions , you can listen to the propositions which you want to listen . each spoken sentence is attached to the exp@@ iring memory . you can select the propositions which will be spoken once again .
setting up the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth . this dialog box contains two mapping cards , voice output and settings , the page of word ab@@ brevi@@ ation and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the box language , enter the command for the call of the language generators . in the selection field , enter the character encoding , with the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two types to pass the text . if the text check the box when the text is unchanged as default in the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be given as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command to the language output from your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples for you find in the app@@ endix .
with possibility of per@@ me@@ ability than language service &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the kt@@ ops language is provided and currently being developed further on SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
the first selection field , according to the selection of a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by selecting a text passage in the menu Text@@ pass@@ age@@ book or in the Lei@@ ste for Text passage ch@@ iefs .
with the selection of So@@ on , the selected text passage is inserted directly and additionally inserted into the orbit space . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage will initially only be entered into the input field .
with the second selection field Cl@@ ose of the processing window for text pass@@ age@@ book , you can define whether the font pass@@ age@@ book automatically is stored in the closing of the processing window .
with the selection of text pass@@ age@@ book , the book is stored . if you select changes , the textbook book will not be stored . choose before saving , it will be saved &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask whether the textbook is to be stored .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ rac@@ ism contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ ter@@ rac@@ ism . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can choose the current dictionary for Wor@@ ter@@ rac@@ usa .
with buttons on the right you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of the books , or add them to a file . below the list you can set the name and in the selection field language for the dictionary .
in this source , select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads , the frequency of the individual words is determined simply by consideration of the assignment . in addition , you can compare the word list with a Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , in order to add only the written words into the new dictionary .
this option allows you to assem@@ ble the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask that dic@@ tion@@ aries are linked , and how these will be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , you will create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; re @-@ compiled words automatically in the dictionary , create a dictionary with your voc@@ abul@@ ary .
the main area of the window for the processing of text pass@@ age@@ box is divided into two parts . in the upper part the text pass@@ ers are presented as a tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding mouse jack . if you have selected text pass@@ age@@ book , you can only change its name .
actions like new Text passages or books add or delete selected text pass@@ words and books , you can either walk through the menu in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a folding menu .
you can change the order of text pass@@ words or text pass@@ words by pulling with the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the selected text is cut out and copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , it is used otherwise the selected areas of the memory .
the selected text is copied to clip@@ board . if in the input field , a text section is selected , it is used otherwise the selected areas of the memory .
the currently active set is spoken . in case of text in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected movements of the run memory is used .
if this menu entry is crossed for frequently used commands . the tool bar is arranged directly under the menu bar directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the sh@@ aded left side and pulling the tool bar can be shifted to another place .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow glue is displayed in the lower part of the main window with references to the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not crossed , this status bar is closed .
if this menu entry is crossed , a p@@ ush@@ able strip for text pass@@ ers with entries will be displayed directly under the tool@@ bar directly under the tool@@ bar . mouse click on the sh@@ aded left side and pulling the tool bar to another place .
probably you have not entered the command for the voice issue not correct or not complete . open settings k@@ mouth ; open the page General settings and enter the command for the language output in the map voice . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer . )
Festival is a voice edition of the Edinburgh University . currently only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch are supported . the license is allowed to use Festival for free and dissem@@ inate any restrictions .
to show an example of command line for setting the language output , it is believed that the festival in the folder / us@@ r / local / festival is installed . the command to the language output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , it only supports the English language . the license is allowed to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and dissem@@ inate any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / us@@ r / local / fre@@ ak folder . the language output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option data must be switched on as default . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ ograph in a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assem@@ ble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license is allowed to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA under the ass@@ umption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / us@@ r / local / local / mb@@ ro@@ la are installed .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is like to be the last sign of the text , so that an additional character must be attached . the full command is therefore more than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / us@@ r / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / / us@@ r / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / lin@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option data is to be switched on as default .
the voice @-@ issue dem@@ on of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; K@@ DE ; further language service provided to all &amp; K@@ DE ; K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language output systems .
since setting up the language generators you only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use c@@ lich@@ en@@ ts@@ d as a voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to setting the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which is installed in the dialog box of &amp; k@@ mouth , when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , which depends on your computer and configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with the people who can &apos;t talk , text can be saved by the computer . there is a list already sung phr@@ ases that the user can always rest@@ art again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer . on the computer you need to install a voice syn@@ thesizer .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter this URL to the address bar of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or start a help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; - the language output system of &amp; K@@ DE ; - is a module of existing service which enables any application to read text via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; is a part system in &amp; K@@ DE ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; K@@ DE ; programmer is ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS capabilities . users also offers interesting options .
read out texts ( or parts of it ) in text editor &amp; Kate ; if &amp; Kate ; in other &amp; K@@ DE applications , which is embedded in the text .
the voice output is made via the program of cross @-@ trans@@ at@@ cher , the various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
enables production of language spending on the command line ( or with Shell scripts ) through the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ Help program .
in the future : support for speech @-@ mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; speech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and speech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the voice @-@ issue service of &amp; K@@ DE ; an application without visible window , offering the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ Bus .
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and establishment of kt@@ ts@@ d via kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browser &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; Kate ; with which a text file can be read or partially read .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org / ) you can subscribe to the list via h@@ tt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org / mail@@ box / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org , channel # K@@ DE @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) .
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; you &apos;ll need to install and set it properly . see also
during the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as yet no actors are set up , the map card is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card will appear in General . see .
most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thesizer offer various languages and voices , such as various male or female , or such that distinguish themselves in volume or speed . you can also set several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should also use one speaker , before you use &amp; kt@@ ops ; as the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise used the standard spokes@@ man .
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with several print jobs for the same printer .
if you click on the map series speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the map Sp@@ ok@@ er is displayed . this will also automatically start if you start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and is still not a speaker .
all the speakers appear in this list . the preferred spokes@@ man appear in the list . the upper speaker is used for the voice output when an application does not make any speaker .
select a mouse click on the list with a mouse click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a mouse click on the list with a mouse click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list below . the order of the actors in the list is determined by its priority .
Click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
select a vote type , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a j@@ gen@@ - and gir@@ ders to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker on the map Sp@@ ok@@ er appears . in order to change the settings of this speaking , click Edit .
well you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; already almost using it . go back to the map of General and check if the T@@ TS Service of &amp; K@@ DE . see . now you can read &amp; kt@@ ops ; please click on the card orders to make text orders to create and manage text . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the language output system by &amp; K@@ DE ; Click on the map series of General to open this ticket card . here you can adjust some general options here .
mark this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ system is successful , the card orders will be displayed and you can read text mot@@ ions and read text . see . remove the marking , the K@@ TT@@ SD card and the T@@ TS system from &amp; K@@ DE ; de@@ activated .
when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is completed , runs &amp; kt@@ ops ; further , if the field of voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is crossed .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system range of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the pre @-@ read is finished .
with buttons in this row , you can start textile mot@@ ions , stopping , and hold back again .
with buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; K@@ DE ; clip@@ board can be read or open a text file to advance . you can also change the speaker for a job .
Click on the user or OK , then all changed settings are adopted on all pages .
the ticket orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD was launched . in order to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the card reader and cross language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; K@@ DE ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first , whether &amp; kt@@ ops ; runs first , and select the text that you want to read , and select the language menu . after a short time , the language output should begin .
it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a website . you can sk@@ ip this step too , but then many &amp; html ; -@@ pre@@ ten@@ ants and other un@@ visible brands are also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; K@@ DE ; , you can read the displayed text . check first , whether &amp; kt@@ ops ; runs first , and then select the text , which should be read , and then choose the language menu tools . then , the language output should begin .
this also works if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Not@@ ice is the news system of &amp; K@@ DE ; which you informed about the events , you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ops ; read more
in &amp; conversation ; , the I@@ RC Program of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can address various kinds of messages ; for example , you can be notified that you will notify you in an I@@ RC channel , in which your nickn@@ ame occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ops ; you can then read the I@@ RC news text .
supports a &amp; K@@ DE ; program K@@ ON@@ LINE , a menu entry is published in the Settings menu of this program , which differ as possible settings for the emergency market .
filter for the character set offer a good opportunity to correct &amp; kt@@ ops ; it is a good example . it is a good example . you can remove the tags b@@ r and b out of the news , which can be sent by email , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , since that can be assumed to be assumed in most cases .
filter are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ops ; the filter is not necessary for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; are filters not necessary .
in filters , text is processed before being sent to the program of cross @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the language , to select false speech or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , or to select a proper language and speaker for certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice synthesis and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tre@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; distingu@@ ishes four kinds of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the edition of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will proceed to all other orders and holds these orders placed . if the edition of the Screen Reader is read , the received orders will be resumed .
you have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved . a warning is priority and keeping the edition of messages and normal text . these orders will be resumed after the issue of the warning .
messages are the next priority . a message is under normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text can be read on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also messages . read it .
the rest are simple text orders . each order , which you use by the card orders , is a text editor . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that have text orders are intended for the edition of longer text , which have no special dr@@ ing@@ ness .
all four order types are processed in qu@@ eu@@ es , with the exception of the issue of Screen Re@@ aders . when an application will send the issue of a Screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ops ; just such a writing , this edition will hold and end .
first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern . you will be applied to normal war@@ nings , news and text orders and at &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ messages .
filter edit the text and continue it at the next filter . at the moment there are three types of filters .
filter are designed as modules . in the future , there can be more kinds of filters .
then replace parts of a text by another text . you can specify either as words or regular expres@@ sions . &amp; kt@@ ops ; the creation of chat @-@ emot@@ ions are supplied by text or for the conversion of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; mail ; in a better comprehen@@ sible form possible .
&amp; XML ; re@@ former uses a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format into another format . in the scope of &amp; kt@@ ops ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are contained in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML included .
with talk selection , you can send orders on the contents of the text , or depending on the program , which have the text on &amp; kt@@ ops ; sent to a speaker . if you have set up a female voice , you can read text by K@@ DE news about it . Si@@ eh@@ e. read it .
each of these various filter has selected rules , according to which it is applied for a voice issue . when the filter ensures that its rules is not re@@ union , he continued the text to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; K@@ DE ; notification of &amp; kt@@ ops ; sent by all activated filters , which were arranged on the page below . processing by the filter is done in the sequence from top to below .
this shows the list of the furnished normal filters . is a filter not crossed , it is not enabled , and is not used . filter will be turned down after the down@@ wards .
Click here to insert a new filter . choose the type of Fil@@ ters , and it will display the following installation dial@@ ogs .
for the set of character fil@@ tering you need to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as comparison chart . these samples are exchanged in the text , then the text will be replaced with the corresponding replacement text .
enter your filter a name . you can choose any name that you can choose only from the name of the other filter .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the string in the column and replace it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is shown in the shown order from top to bottom .
Click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with this buttons , you can download a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file to store the current list or delete a list from a file , the entries from the file would be attached to the existing list .
here is a language registered here , the filter is only applied , if the speaker for the text order is listed here . Click on the button to show a list of languages . you can also press several languages if you click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l . button .
if the filter is registered here , the filter is applied only if the text is from one of the specified applications . you can set multiple programs separated by Kom@@ mat@@ a . example : con@@ vers@@ ation , k@@ mail
the application ID @-@ run programs you will receive with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; D@@ bus ; numbers must be we@@ aving . if you like &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only have to enter copies .
the filters en@@ forcement filters will only be applied to the text when all conditions with one entry in the box Di@@ eses filter if you agree . all input fields empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when compared to words used the character sequences of regular expres@@ sions in the form \ \ s Word \ \ s. The words must therefore be limited by part@@ itions ( space characters ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing of regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed the &amp; K@@ DE ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; text editor &amp; # 160 ; text editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions can be found in the package .
&amp; XML ; re@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with help from X@@ SL@@ T files from one format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such circumstances . it can only be used on well @-@ shaped XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the ambient variable Path , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also enough .
with the speaking filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the Kart@@ ei@@ card actors , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can define that texts by k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ops ; a text to the filter is searched , it is looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker is searching for the text , the program is selected , and the characteristics of the Sp@@ ok@@ er Sp@@ ok@@ es@@ person spokes@@ man . with the spokesperson for the speaker , you can write the selected spokes@@ man .
here is a value registered here , if the text is applied , if the text is applied , if the text is installed on your system of the &amp; K@@ DE ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; patient &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions installed , you can call this with one click on the button to retri@@ eve help when entering the input .
to get faster processing , you should try to an@@ cho@@ red the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place the characteristics of the desired speaking filter conditions . if the text complies with the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected , which corresponds to the desired requirements on the h@@ ott@@ est . Click on the right to view the dialogue microphone selection .
use the buttons to save or delete your settings settings or delete all settings .
the speaking filter is only applied to the text when all conditions with one entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if necessary . you must have at least a condition .
the language output API , by &amp; K@@ DE ; , with programmer &apos;s to give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD , making &amp; kt@@ ops ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section includes a short description of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ D@@ bus ; interface of voice API from &amp; K@@ DE ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is , you will find at K@@ DE ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / C@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de.@@ org ) .
applications call for voice controls via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface from &amp; K@@ DE ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d above the object K@@ speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is text of the text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands ,
open two &amp; console window ; start windows . start the kt@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the af@@ o@@ rem@@ enti@@ oned voice syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML , per@@ former@@ filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read yet .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone , so if you do not use this voice to read from websites . make sure that the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is installed and you can find the ambient variable Path .
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation seem to cause errors in syn@@ thesizer , so that all propositions are sk@@ ipped or only Kau@@ p@@ eb@@ sch . what can I do ?
please make sure that the option is set to the right value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , this may be fixed by a character shift filter . see .

the list of the above @-@ mentioned languages can be in@@ complete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , you will find the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ops ; , according to information , which are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; Co@@ qu@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ops ; for using another syn@@ thes@@ izers , you can use with the developers team in conjunction with the developers .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian @-@ User may install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ops ; you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) , including packages , and the program files for the program &quot; Double @-@ Th@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ops ; released from the source text archive for we@@ dge @-@ proof or translate the program created with the following commands to install the program with following commands :
before you are using &amp; kt@@ ops ; first use , check out if you &apos;re working with your voice syn@@ thesizer . you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ skri@@ pt SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; which is used as the program of tre@@ ach@@ ers . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is supposed to be further developed that the setting of tre@@ ach@@ ers directly is possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is divided into single propositions . the user can return or retri@@ eve the user , repeat the issue , or break the output .
if an application provides text on &amp; kt@@ ops ; if you have a speaker , for example , if you have one speaker , whose language English and his sex is , if you want to know more about it , such as &amp; kt@@ ops ; one person will choose to see how &amp; kt@@ ops ; if you choose a speaker , see you in .
if you click on the map Sp@@ ok@@ er , click on adding a speaker into the list or click Edit , the map file name is displayed . as an example , in the below , you will find the map of the module for Festival Interactive . details of the modules can be found under .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path goes to Festival in Path , you have to enter just a festival .
select the character encoding for text , which will be handed out to Festival . in voices , the &amp; kt@@ ops ; known , this setting will be automatically made . generally , Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 is used to use Eastern languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ene ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with this sli@@ der , adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch @-@ height of the synthetic language . if you are not able to select a few kno@@ b and displayed this gray , the chosen voice cannot be selected from you .
some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices will need to be loaded for several seconds due to their size . if you load this check box , these votes are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with higher memory consumption ) the first set is faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up any speaker ( or forget to click on the user ) .
if this check box is marked , the starting m@@ gr the program window is displayed . otherwise , after launching only the symbol m@@ gr in system stage is visible , but not the program window . Click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD has a text reads , so you have the possibility to stop the pre@@ ference or otherwise .
here are all orders placed in the qu@@ eu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order to the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the just worked set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the map speaker .
with buttons in this series you can select a complete set in the order that is selected in the list below , pre @-@ hand or return . ( but not every job consists of several movements ) .
with a click on OK all changes to the settings ( also on the other map cards ) and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . Click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts system ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card audio . see also .
here , only text orders are listed and managed . editions of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern , War@@ nings and messages are not displayed . further information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ops ; find in .
choose the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ops ; either without support for the corresponding audio module compiled or kt@@ ops ; may not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de can be used for the audio output , select here the audio output . if no output modules are displayed on the list , you need at least one module , select here the PCM tool . see also
adjust the microphone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to approximately half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about double normal speaking speed . thus these settings can be implemented , the program SO@@ X must be installed .
Click on users to take over the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , choose the default .
on this cardboard card you can setup special promotions that will always be executed if the text order is interrupted by a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ops ; processed four types of language orders :

the speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for the voice of voices , speaking speed , the noise of the voice and the pitch . Moreover , SS@@ ML is part of Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C specification .
currently , &amp; kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ML can only be part and only in the basic functions . the following limitations are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , as this is the default vote , which is used for the issue of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or audio system in the Festival configuration dialog does not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % is usually spoken , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and proposition identification filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . therefore , you can start &amp; retri@@ eve the whole proposition , as only the first movement has to be pre @-@ read or rest@@ oring , and when the voice syn@@ thesizer is not directly supported .
here you see the pro@@ positi@@ onal bound@@ ary filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops ; it is automatically set up as a proposition for a pro@@ positi@@ onal bound@@ ary filter . you can add the change or further movement of de@@ mar@@ cation filters , but they will be dis@@ closed .
on the eas@@ iest way , you learn how to check out the intercom selection and select text to advance . check out the card selection , change some features and check how to select the selection of the microphone . for this purpose you have to have set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then , faster with the pre @-@ read , since only the first movement must be processed , and not the whole text block , which can last very long .
you can retri@@ eve text orders on the card orders or can be cancelled , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer doesn &apos;t support this function .
for these reasons , the normal proposition can be set automatically when you start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr the first time . it cannot be switched off , only be removed . do not change anything about this filter , unless you know what you do .
set @-@ up filters get text with a regular expression of pro@@ positi@@ onal sign and add a Tab@@ ul@@ ator@@ mark ( Dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ positi@@ onal limits ( tab@@ ular code will automatically be removed from the text ) . note that the standard set @-@ generation filters will retain the character encoding .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ messages ( kn@@ ur@@ fy ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern .
if you have removed the normal movement characteristic filter , you can return this again by un@@ loading the file standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c .
referring to the map Inter@@ phone selection you can write the microphone settings for the application . the ticket card is displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the map ) speaker . with other words : no speaking properties will be specified .
use of the pass@@ est microphone station , which shows all the features of the speaker . if you choose the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ops ; this speaker from . otherwise cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ops ; the speaker from which originally introduced the originally introduced properties .
select the method for entering the desired microphone properties by clicking on the selection buttons .
select the characteristics of the desired string . if this property doesn &apos;t play a role , don &apos;t matter .
mark this check box when the property preced@@ ence should have any other features . you can also put several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor when the output is described , this property is rarely treated as a priority property . you may know this property is rare if you possibly know the attri@@ bute language , if you may know that a specific application is disp@@ at@@ ched in another language as being introduced in the work environment .
in order to use all the properties in the field , which corresponds to the following below , click on the selection button and then use speaker , which corresponds to the following below .
in this case , 0 stands for the last text order in the qu@@ eu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without a order number is the input 0 required ) .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , which is open source code . the quality of the votes is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many votes , you can adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch .
you need to install at least one language . for this purpose you will find in the instructions given by the festival . you would like to read our web pages , you have to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code of Festival . the German votes are subject to con@@ stra@@ ints during the transfer .
this voice uses Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ pack the software in the festival / li@@ b / voc@@ abul@@ ary / Russian . if you set the Russian votes , you need to set a k@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually contained in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . find the festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you wish to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ illi@@ c as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; Syn@@ thesizer . then the festival takes the le@@ x@@ ik@@ al analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; it produces audio output . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; program and the mb@@ ro@@ la ; voices can be downloaded from

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; kn@@ itting work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ control@@ center , which allows the administration of network interfaces , routine and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; allows users to manage a series of system and desktop settings over a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; control@@ center ; can be called by selecting from K Menu k@@ control@@ center ;
the &amp; kn@@ u@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; control@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; displayed . the module network settings ( kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the control@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
it &apos;s important to understand that &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware can not install . physical devices and their drivers need to be operational and configured to configure &amp; cra@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; the device performs at all and setting the network properties .
most of the cases are drivers for the network hardware and other devices to install &amp; Linux ; installed and installed . network devices later added , the drivers need to be charged with the following files , according to the kernel version :
the module network settings will be loaded when the network settings in the &amp; control@@ center ; index Index is selected . when starting the module network you try to detect the platform automatically on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the platform is offered from the list where the distribution and the release of non @-@ pol@@ ls can be adjusted permanently . by marking the network settings , this selection can be set automatically . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will automatically be set automatically .
the change of network settings are possible only in the system management mode . previously , all options can be displayed , which means settings can be viewed only . in the system management mode you will proceed by clicking the button management mode at the right bottom of the module . it is the input of the password required .
in the system management mode the total functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces can be used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be carried out :
the displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and pressing the button interface ... in a dialogue device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are only available . Click on the button on the dialog with further possibilities .
with the selection of Autom@@ atically the TCP / IP settings of a D@@ H@@ CP Server or BO@@ O@@ TP server will be carried out with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server will be selected for the system simultaneously . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the selection Manu@@ ell can be made TCP / IP configuration without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the required TCP / IP address is required . in the input field network mask , the sub@@ net mask is set .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alized the network interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not necessary , this option should not be activated .
the values specified in this dialog will be displayed as the properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address is not already used in the network . entering a TCP / IP conflict with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine whether the desired address is already in use . in the doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off . switching of an enhanced network device is enabled by selecting from the list and pressing the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off . switch off of an activated network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on interface ....
sets the IP address of the host in local sub@@ net that the physical connection is medi@@ ated to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the net where the Gateway computer is selected .
a machine with DNS support replaces the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computer only requires IP addresses . if the calcul@@ ator h@@ tt@@ p is required , it replaces the IP address such as IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator to the name resolution part of the riding name can be added to a simple administration of this list . entries can be added or altered by selecting a paper read or down@@ gra@@ ding or down@@ gra@@ dation in the list with buttons or down in the priority .
by clicking the button to add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution can be added to the DNS server . it will add the New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button to add . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group of calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select one entry and then click on the Edit button .... It will display the dialog .
the list of well @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes computer name @-@ to @-@ IP address references to the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily on bo@@ oting , if no DNS server is available . in small , completed networks it can replace DNS server .
normally the list includes some entries , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses will support . this is still in the test version of IP should be replaced in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click &quot; Add .... The New Testament dialog will be shown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and click the button . if the known computer has several alias name , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button add several times and also enter the other alias name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
select an inv@@ alu@@ able editor from the list and select Edit .... The dialog has to edit your computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there can be one of the following tasks are executed by clicking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK list &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; list is updated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
settings are not effective in the module &apos;s network settings . in order to enable the changes , in a &amp; console , the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; is h@@ tt@@ p : / / kn@@ itting conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source software .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; K@@ DE and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply downloading the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphical surface can be used as a package or the installation tool of their distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE is sufficient ; but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is only experienced users recommended . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; cra@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; compiled the following commands should aff@@ ord .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology is given , in the second all by &amp; kn@@ u@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files are discussed .
this area can not replace any further information about IP networks . in this app@@ endix , basic information on the integration of the PC is medi@@ ated in a small ( home ) network .
currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 5 has never found great spread . this description is currently concentr@@ ating on the common IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is to as@@ sign the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , am &amp; eg ; workplace is the network configuration , that can be used , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can &apos;t be simply chosen !
when installing a own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specially designed for this purpose , to avoid IP address fli@@ cker with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not re@@ directed in the Internet , therefore its any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a g@@ at@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , addresses are used in the range from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are included in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0.0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the default route is needed for the IP @-@ forward line .
the network address 12@@ 7.0.0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine . normally the address 12@@ 7.0.0@@ .1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; kn@@ u@@ work@@ conf ; are affected and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is dynam@@ ically modified in DSL connections , so that it is not surprised , if in the case of active DSL connections , another content is set to be found there .
for &amp; SuSE ; is known that this file is sorted by the script in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand is expected to occur .

&amp; dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of t@@ ar . it offers the opportunity to create several archives on a band . the first goal was to create a question for t@@ ar . the second goal was the answer of a question that my wife said : how much longer does it take ?
before a band can be used , it must be done by &amp; dat ; this can happen to three types :
&amp; dat ; sp@@ ult the band back and reads the pre@@ st@@ ating information of the band . recognize &amp; dat ; not asked if the band is format@@ ted on the tape , you are asked if the band is format@@ ted .
det@@ ects &amp; dat ; the advance when searching for the matching index on your disk . can not be found , you will be asked if the band@@ index is to be created .
everything went smooth , changing the symbol for tape work , to view that the band is bound . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the band can now be searched for the tape .
before the t@@ oss of the ban@@ ana , initially , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to apply this :
&amp; dat ; is by changing the symbol for the tape , that the binding for the band has solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be cast out without any risk .
before a band of &amp; dat ; it is possible to be format@@ ted by &amp; dat ; format@@ ted .
a belt types must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not comply with form@@ att@@ ing &amp; dat ; this process does not need to be format@@ ted before using the tape . flo@@ ppy disk drives cannot be format@@ ted before using the tape . flo@@ ppy disk drives cannot be format@@ ted before using the tape .
after entering the band named and the capacity drives &amp; dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the band . all data on the tape are lost , the band is automatically bound and is ready to use .
before you use the backup process , you must select the necessary files . this can happen to three ways :
select a file or folder in a local file tree . it is only backed up to this file or folder .
select a security profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in local file tree with a Hä@@ k@@ chen . only the so selected files and / or sub@@ folder are secured .
Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select the menu in Sich@@ uan Menu ...
once the backup was initiated , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog you can check once the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will appear . dialogue shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives on the entry for the drive . it is only checked for the selected file or folders .
select the files in one of the archives inside the band with a Hä@@ k@@ chen . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are checked .
Click with the right button of mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
once the test run has started , the dialog settings for checking . in this dialog you can check your choice once and check the folder for checking out .
if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears to check out . this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can set the restore , the files that are to be recovered will be selected . this may occur on two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives which are for entry for the tape work . it will only restore the selected file or sub @-@ folders .
select the files from one of the archives created with a Hä@@ k@@ chen . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders will be restored .
with the right mouse button , click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select the File menu ....
once the recovery process was launched , the dialog for Rest@@ oration . in this dialog you can check your choice once and change the working folder for restoration .
if you have confirmed the settings for the restoration , the dialog appears again . this dialog shows the progress of recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to create the band inde@@ x@@ ing file using the band content . this process is er@@ ase all existing index files for this band . you can create the index to two types of the band :
this is a backup profile with the just selected files and the default settings . you can use the following settings for the following settings :
the current work folder where the backup should be made . the list of saf@@ est files will be updated automatically according to the selected standard folder .
for all folders that are listed under backup files , that only those files are stored in the same file system , such as the folder . folders that are located on other file systems , you can register separately under backup files . each entry is considered by t@@ ar independent of the other .
using an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files secured that since then has changed .
the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before the call of t@@ ar . this causes that all files will be backed up to a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons are sum@@ s &amp; gt ; and lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can setup the settings via the menu option K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be displayed :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path has to refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the belt device .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; dat ; before the band is bound , the command will load on the drive . for some drives , this is necessary before reading or write operations .
if the option is switched on , tried &amp; dat ; the refuse exp@@ ulsion of the tape work could not work with all band drives .
if the option is switched on , if necessary , the switch is cast out automatically ; use this option not at Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers &apos; option .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; dat . not all drives support variable log sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must have &amp; dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; dat ; a band format@@ ted , writes a file at the beginning of the band . this file should only fill a memory block on the band . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this string is computer name : seconds , the computer name of the full name of the system is format@@ ted on which the tape is format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that has been format@@ ted since the era .
the band @-@ ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the tape are pure t@@ ar @-@ archives that can manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - t@@ ar to manage . even other t@@ ar versions should work as long as it does not comply with incre@@ mental f@@ uses .
check the content of a backup job . this icon is only active if a band is bound .
&amp; ks@@ ystem log ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; viewer can not know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system can be stored on your system or where the system allows for the quick access to any information on problems that occur on their server .
&amp; ks@@ ystem log ; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background . it is a simplified diagram of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system is stored on the various protocol files .
in addition , it allows users to provide quick access to the example of information on problems that occur on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; therefore attempts to provide some extended functions , and can be evaluated and evaluated using the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 and the system log log ; a number of useful features . among others , among others :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included in addition to the further chapters of this hand@@ book .
as you see in the following screen photo , &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; functions are available , with their help the individual protocol @-@ lines of a protocol file easily fil@@ tering and sort . the individual possibilities for sorting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this hand@@ book .
after launching the system tries and open log log ; initially the most important protocol file system of the system - the system protocol takes you to open . the protocol files can be found under Linux in the folder / var / log , for the normal users don &apos;t have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filters according to a limited range crit@@ erion or according to the filter bar . in the default setting the box contains the selected filters all . then a protocol line is displayed only if in one of the columns you will contain the filter search results .
you can also select another entry at this place . the string of the filter search results are then balanced only with entries in the selected column . in addition , in the filter bar , select the name of a process , so shows you &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; all protocol @-@ lines sent or created by this process .
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you to detect the most important protocol @-@ lines . protocol @-@ lines of level error are displayed with a remarkable color as the protocol @-@ lines of the level display . the color presentation of protocol @-@ lines can be disabled .
if you would like to display only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the cr@@ on Protocol ) , so you can investigate the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process , if you want to examine the issue of a specific command , such as the launch of the sam@@ ba server . in this case you can use filter bar .
in addition , you can sk@@ ip the option to new lines on the context menu of the main window to view all the new @-@ coming protocol @-@ lines .
&amp; ks@@ ystem log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage it . once you select a sub@@ windows , select a protocol to the menu .
&amp; ks@@ ystem log ; has a dedicated website to h@@ tt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ g. d@@ ort you will find further information about the supply of supply and ks@@ ystem log .
&amp; ks@@ ystem log ; also available in the following folder of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Subversion archive : photo log log ; im &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Archive
welcome to the &amp; K@@ DE ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and in the following also called ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V In@@ it developed quickly to the standard for checking the program start in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it .
I &apos;m not able to enter the historical aspects here ( others because I don &apos;t know it : - ) .
the in@@ ite @-@ binding file is under / s@@ am and not under / etc . this is therefore important because someone could try to make a machine to system V In@@ it , without a re@@ installation and reform@@ att@@ ing . therefore , you need to see that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was there .
the sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also distingu@@ ishes itself by the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead directly in / etc . this folder means r@@ c.@@ the D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for each system . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; broadcast ; , h@@ tt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services does not include such things such as set@@ serial which only started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie on / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if it does not have much use for this . you can also want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel is looking for different places after the program and starts the first one finds it .
the default Run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line as the following :
at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably determine that the default Run@@ level 3 is possible . if you want to change the default Run@@ level 3 . if you want to pass the default changes , then you can install anything , then proceed to rest@@ art the system and run the following :
but how does it start to enter all the right scripts ? if you like ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder will be no right files . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does and stop un@@ ite actually system services ? quite simple : any of the scripts is so written that it accepts a argument , like the start and stop . you can actually start this script from hand on the command line :
this would be called the h@@ tt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the K includes , the script will be called with the argument . if he contains a S , the script will start with the argument .
some people wish you an easy way to create machines for many purposes . I might have &amp; eg ; a server running level , which can run only h@@ tt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . furthermore , I could have a user @-@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; k@@ icks off .
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other hand device is simple to say tri@@ vi@@ al : simply drag an entry from the availability system services to one of the six Run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can move scripts also between Run@@ lev@@ eling or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . in this case , the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or his position ) . this is just not going to extract any entry from the availability system services .
note : entries will be post@@ pon@@ ed if you need to copy these into a new Run@@ level , you have to select copying from the menu edit or from the context menu and then enter the target range -- even if the same record has already existed in the target area of the promotion .
the sorting number of this entry may not be calculated sometimes . in such case you must process the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : there are currently no possibility to restore entries that have been thrown into the paper basket . be careful .
you can use the tab button to enable the various work areas ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous one .
to push one entry into another Run@@ level , move it with cutting into the clip@@ board ( you can also use c@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired Run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
in order to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the button to change the properties dialog . connect the tab button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . def@@ aults to the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) , if it is available . otherwise they are stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ lev@@ elling , and now does the machine start constantly . what can I do ?
enter the l@@ ilo -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single use mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution in Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) you need to use additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read details in the manual of the distribution .
the species , as system services in these distri@@ butions are launched , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the propri@@ etary insights programs of these distribution , but does not comply with the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution : check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are located in the right directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache or h@@ tt@@ p@@ d ) can easily finish without a message if your configuration files are not available or false .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send us more about the Run@@ level , so that this manual may be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; user ; read .
after you have made changes , you have to save them . either using the respective icon of tool bar or record Save In the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is an easy application . the main window consists of two cardboard cards , the user and user group . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears to the dialogue user or group properties .
some cardboard cards are only represented when you have extended system settings . only if you have limited system settings , you can appear on the individual settings . further boxes cards appear if shadow pass@@ words or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Unix .
the cart@@ ons password will appear if shadow pass@@ words or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed such as BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
this card card appears only if for at least an embedded file system space ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ z@@ able at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters for each user , with the limit of space in KB are :
this parameter can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field of file system .
the Kart@@ ei@@ Card groups informs about the group of the selected user . the group group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the primary group . furthermore , the user can become a member of the group by taking this in the large field .
the Group &apos;s dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select from the menu users or group or click the appropriate adding button of tool bar . editing or er@@ asing of selected users or the selected group works analogue .
with this module you can add the l@@ ilo boot manager to add the boot word , remove and change the time to bo@@ oting the standard operation system , remove the default business system , remove , change operating systems , change and more .
