<seg id="13">The module & fsview; for & conqueror; provides a further view of objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory with local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbols and text views to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The feature of & fsview; consists in it, parached folder hierarchies with the help of the so-called Tree Map-Map allow the representation of the size of objects in missing structures. each object is equivalent to its size. this size must have the sum of the size of the subordinated objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">In & fsview; the size of a folder is defined as the sum of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries is defined. according to this way, large files can be detected, even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & fsview; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command can be viewed.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & fsview; is an entry in the Treemap-depicts a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for simpler navigation, the rectangles have the rectangles of full colour coding and labelling settings.</seg>

<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the respective file or folder. for each property you can determine whether it is possible to appear even if sufficient space is to be displayed or whether the surface of subordinated strates are to be used. Moreover, you can set the relative position of the label in the rectangle below.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the display algorithm for Treemaps, the surface should not be observed. at the Treemap in & fsview; this goal is not always available to show the disappearance of entries, and this frame is not always available, which is less space for the frame, if the square is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a division of the area of an entry was made for the subordinated entries, the implementation will remain so important for the reference and to avoid space losses through the frame always contains square. the best methods for lines, columns or recursive second line.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimum view on the menu entry for an entry over the menu entry. instead, a room sample is drawn in the area of the ordered entry, in order to view that this area is actually occupied by a subordinated entry.</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterised by using Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for the actual transmission to the computer, the camera is often used as a disk drive. the camera is then used as a disk drive. the camera can also use the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras are using the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digiplug; uses the program gPhoto2 for digital cameras, which supports an continuously increasing number of digital cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images of digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for its communication with the computer. as photos in general files are unfolded and transmissions through the serial port are slowly solete. & digicame; supports this cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphotoelectric 2 has to be created with libexiph support and therefore need to read the preview pictures of the digiplug. the EXIF support is not available in libgphotoelectric 2. if the EXIF support is not available in libgphotoelectric 2, you can possibly be unable or could be very slow.</seg>

<seg id="151">Maybe you'll be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly on your location. if you have enough photos, then you will use subfolder as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; you will then publish a folder for pictures that you want to print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, working processes, constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of all. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% are working files and you will not reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files do together? the separation of file types makes the stack of easier. split new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are searching for an original or derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend to save the metadata in the site of metadata in & digious; if you forget this, then you can save the metadata data from the database to the files by clicking on the menu album the corresponding item.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change that? it represents & digious; they are a metadata editor for a number of selected Attribucks. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now, the real work begins, since you should select all images that you need to select the same attribute and the value. of course, you can start the same attribute and the value. this makes sense when you can concentrate on top of the best pictures.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's go with keywords, keywords, how you are often hot in other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you importing cataloggles images from a different source with embedded sample, then the pictures will be attached to the right place. this sort of the hierarchy is not problem and can be easily done by pulling a sub-tree to another. the modified keywords are being pursued by & digious; updated while the undertrees are tracked.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graph shows how different metadata is overcut. this is a very rough representation because each block of metadata is made in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data is properties of all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough the keywords - the next section relates to labels or comments using the third major tool to catalogze your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most people want to see your photos just see, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure to arrive interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panoramic view. from Ferne is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look closer look, then catch some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say you this of the landing area of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing, memories, the historical period is present again, you may even hear the silence, so you can even hear the silence of this panoramic pictures completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For other photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you have shown pictures you should tell a story. remember to help him, the key is to help you know about the motive that it moves to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine, if a picture is not perfect when it has the strength only with a label for himself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digious; you can save a lot of text in an internationalphabet (UTF-8) as labeling. you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time. if you want to export your images in web galleries, then you will tell the story about your wishes and / or the title of Web Galery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the time before GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet before GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now is already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of the geolocalization are already innumerable, and can be sure that a day, in the near future, you can also open the photos at the recording venue. you can also download KML files. you can also view the pictures at the recording venue. you can also export the pictures at the recording venue. you can also export images on the recording venue. you can also export the pictures at Google Maps 2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with Google Earth viewer viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and designates the practice of copyrights to remove limitations about the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all modified versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you that information in the setup page of & digicame; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">The author (synonym for actors and author): this field was to add your name, or the name of the photographer, e.g. in order to protect the name of the photographer, e.g. in order to be saved the name of a company or organization. according to that value, it should not be changed. this field does not support Commas nor semicolons as a partition.</seg>
<seg id="173">Car itel (synonym for author): linked to the author. examples of this field contains the work name of the photographer. examples for this can be title like: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a merk to the car field, this is necessary to be completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (synonym for suppliers): do not use the image file to identify which this photo has. this must not necessarily be the author. if the photographer is shown here, you can offer this Organizations here. if the picture is a camp photo, then the group / Agency offers the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this is not a lot more than base knowledge in work with calculator, or change the solution for this problem are digital watermarks. for individuals, this is especially important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digiplug; it is available in the near future, such a module for stacking processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record error, failure, current failure, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, desasteresis, lifetime, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the road or a fire. these kind of dissists are those that can happen to you with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section there are problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics that have a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to tackle the problem with CDs / DVDs, you have to do this prediction and you may not get more than a few years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality. there are offers of gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether they believe it is in your accessibility.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be readable, but you can use this risk in which you can use good discos and good recording devices. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much reliable. so it rotates to select the right.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if you have just written only. therefore, they use a control mechanism to protect it. 75% of the data are only needed for formatting and the control sums. despite this massive protection it is required by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust and etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called IsoBuster, which works apparently with CDs and DVDs, but is not available for Macs. there is also similar applications the damaged data of damaged floppy disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to save the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything which was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also considered for the Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slow with a good recording on high quality media in a non-quality media. read the media with a description, date & author passmarks and afterwards on a clean, dark dry and in animals protected area. don't forget to read the data on the next generation of media or software that can read the media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturer retain your statistics for themselves. their manufacturer guarantee include a new disk, but not the data. Google has a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks available: dismissing disk missing</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: discoincides in the operating temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C, the error rate increases dramatically. electronic parts of the Controllers are the most frequent error correction. some of SMART can terminate this mistakes. this is particularly reading errors and failure. the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only around the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course you can also secured data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can usually produce without large problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric appliances are not much, the devices with computer chips and high-speed processors. these can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies may cause serious damage, hardware ealizing, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect it even before inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">Most common protection against electricity points is a overvoltage protection. this is a device that is absorbs and the rest. it is usually available in the shape of a plug-in. think it is normally a overvoltage socket.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should respect the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. they should also be sure that it protects against flashes, so that it protects properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage can use any cable to your computer, you should also use it all peripherals which can be connected to your system. some manufacturers provide overvoltage levels that also include a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and television.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks, and therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the modem. so you are ideal for the traveling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While a overvoltage protection will protect your system in front of smaller variations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete loss. even a few seconds can bring to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore make sense to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection against overvoltages, these devices can automatically make battery energy available. some models allow them even further to work up to the current. if you purchase a UPS, you should even be sure that they are the same quality requirements such as overvoltage protection. furthermore, the life time of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk to avoid your computer system and compare its safety against electricity problems with the cost of avoidance of these. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be paid up to & euro; 20. this is just a small price difference when you need to keep your computer. at the end, you should always think all cables to trast in the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use this as drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can save any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs & dollar bill; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollar bill; 500. in addition, you need to send the data on the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution but it is not a general backup solution. therefore it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com are available on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures at your disposal, in case of Flickr dramatically more. for $25 per year, you get unlimited memory, which should be checked out in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, web solutions are very secure. transmission errors will be automatically adjusted in accordance with the TCP protocol and is included in the offer a backup and a covered memory. so they are desasterable.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are susceptible to transfer errors. the file system and btrfs represent at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that there is no one that has occurred in your hardware. all these disorders remain undiscovered until you have not been destroyed during your computer. no one seems to have any protection in your computer. no one seems to have any protection. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data way than that of your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable network supplies are a further source for transfers losses, as they generate interferences within data streams. in normal file systems this error remains unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not affected particularly by transfers problems you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes every year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates, which can handle with record missing on low level and is available with one of the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is soon available for & Linux; and Windows available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrash file system. this is still in alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanism the zfs and is also available for & Linux; it is still not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate that! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in notebook and 46% at workplace systems. for notebooks, the proportion of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the most expensive. it leads to a lower damage, e.g. theft or new installations; and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; already no longer have been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less vulnerable for data loss as proprietary systems: false, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFs, JFS and XFS to call the common file systems. a very good English articles can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and undefined status is avoided during an operation is not completely saved before the problem was lost, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings are removed from fundamental physical limits. it is a natural limit for that progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go in the direction of 10 megapixels. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result. even DSLR cameras, your limit for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras you need a full format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk drive you are responsible for 100 & euro cents. thus, you do not need any data loss for data loss. thus, your data is often affected by a data loss, and try this backup before you do anything else than the reinstallation of your operating system to make exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you suppose your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash strikes you're lucky if the drive was not connected in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster suggests locally and destroys a lot. do not forget aircraft farming: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough. they usually concern one whole space or entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore disintegration is always a non-local storage. bring your fuses up to the stairs to the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as above, it is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup, which is not available immediately, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files will be secured. it is a moment without history and represents a complete copy of any time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential protection: a backup of files have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete moment of time to two timeline: the complete safeguarding and the final differential protection.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of files have been changed since the last backup. this creates a snapshot at any time. this backup will once again produce a versioning system on the next with the exception that it is only abstained and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that can easily be set up on your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transmissions. rsync only the difference of files the really changed. this happens and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or other visual media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach lets you make enough time to discovering losses and restore. at the same time, you come to restore a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly moment of application for at least one month and a moment for each month. every additional dilution should be done manually, after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original retained, memory, scalability, media, re-finding images and metadata, copy the pictures to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visibility,..., usage of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">To get valuable images the next 40 years, that is about the period of you really interested in you, because they are interested in your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Because the future is unpredictable because of your nature, you need to look at all this day. unfortunately, there is no other possibility to ask yourself as the current system backward. every 5-8 years, you should ask yourself as the current system backwards compatible. if less variants you have used in the past, so it is easier to evaluate the issues of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards which are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is nowadays available for everyone. if you have an old system, so that you are important to read your pictures, then keep it on and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite easy: if you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay in open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the expert pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size. this means always enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go out that you have set the scalability with the plan and enlarge the area you want to enlarge a dedicated disk or partition. at * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and store them to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check the dmesg command whether your new record is detected by the system, but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / SDC # source is / dev / SDC / SDC # source is / dev / SDC # source, the new record is / dev / sdc1 0 & B; size of the plate in MBgt; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and travel agents; residu2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of departure if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open Source Standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if a day no software can be read more, then you can create this task. this task will be easier by year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format which disappears slowly from the market. you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was developed as an open source file to replace the GIF. however, it's a loss that supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma- and chromaticity data for improved color information, but not as many as TIFF needs and a slow compression. this format would like to store you to store your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as an image format. TIFF can store in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm. a problem is not needed to store your images in this format. there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a licensed and open screen format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG was developed based on the need for metadata. a handy camera manufacturer is now available and we hope to use the competitors for Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology; a mixture of XML and RDF. this is a label of XML and RDF. the file information is stored in a file itself. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; saved the XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers pull it before a original of your photo, which can be archived in the shell format. however, the metadata can store separately from the image file, but it can be noted, as indicated above, the raw format. therefore, you should overlay it if you use DNG as a container, and lay all there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organisation that supports fully compatible online metadata standards that supports a wide range of applications and business models, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and explanatory efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert crude files to DNG and store them in your Roharchives. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine processing, you can use external programs. if you edit the pictures again with & digious; then you should add the metadata. these were cut off from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital watermark. export it then to Webgaleries, encode to MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc.</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digious; in the section add a photos to a album, you can add photos that you already have on your hard disk. however, the camera interface offers you many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatenbank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; use this with the computer, turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, this is trying to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, the filename is available at the bottom end and the preview pictures of all photos. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for file rules for each file, photos, movies, music etc, are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need any camera information to any entry. with the side bars features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and the photo information to be saved internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded yet to your computer. note that for some digital cameras not all information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The horsemen metadata shows the internal metals such as EXIF, manufacturer remark, GPS etc. this information is the same as with the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digious; or the image processing. note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The simplest way to download photos on your computer, is the click download and then download the selection of All your camera into a single album in & digious;. when downloading images are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were stored in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the desired standard selection methods of & KDE. once you select the photos selected, use the button Download and then selected selected. the button Selected is full as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">When your camera supports this, is a new option available. this pictures have now not been downloaded from & digious; in this case, the new pictures have been marked with a star in advance window. if you select this option, of course the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you can download the buttons, download or selected from selected files, a dialog appears where you can select the target album, as the list of existing albums, you can read in the list of my albums, and then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After which you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digious; invites the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you downloaded the desired photos, you can delete these from the camera. you can erase all of them by clicking the button. if you want to delete the button all, you'll need to select this first and erase selected delete entries.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there are no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera. you should be sure to delete the photos into a & digious; -album have been downloaded, before you want to delete them from the camera. if you want to delete the camera memory, this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as a filename for photos often do not use special meaningful name. the filenames are often discharged in the same album, if you can download photos of several recordings into the same album. therefore, it may be meaningful to integrate the date and time to integrate the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors of the image and for data-based subsidy. if you use this latter option, will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options While the transfer opens three further options to be carried out before the photos on the disk is stored. if you select this, the corresponding items from EXIF information can be copied to the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use a different date format as the standard format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% m-%% H:% M S. please switch the option date & time. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the command-time.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you are using the camera filename option, you have the possibility to change the filenames in lowercase. or in case letters if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, which was used & digiplug; for a photo is displayed below the name, the camera is displayed in preview. your settings will be saved and automatically used when you can open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digicame; may use all the information on the orientation of the camera to perform a automatic spin during shutdown. not all cameras are ready for download. in section sidebar metadata, you can read more details about the information which has embedded your camera into the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally switched on, and if your camera doesn't supply this information, & digious; the photo in the original orientation. if you want the automatic turn off, use the button Create and select the Automatic rotation in the lower range of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera was made information about the date on which the photo has been made available, you can use & digious; this substitches are loaded on the image data. all images with the same date are uploaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras can be read in the same sub album. in section sidebar Meta-data you can read which information can be embedded in photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case, & digious. if you want to change this option, you need to switch this option. use this option, and select the date file-based subalies at the bottom end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to download from your computer to your camera is button to download. select the file selection dialog & KDE; appears where you can select the files uploaded to you. you can also select more than one file using the default & KDE; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & digious; you, where the pictures should be loaded too. a folder selection dialog appears for the camera. select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this is a position that can be displayed in longitudes and latitude, which can be displayed on a map. the determination of the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photo prints, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical place. not everyone uses an airplane to record a field through automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planner, military, police, architectural office and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have later forgotten, where exactly the photo was done, you can open a browser that shows the area. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digious; users can, who want to document the place of photos, or simply only this aspect, it is good the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how to get the GPS data in the picture? first, you should know that eciv2 are supported, such as the data in these fields? there are at least three ways to reach this. directly with the right hardware, on a reworking of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical assignment (manual) and last about manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there is a few that work with GPS receivers simultaneously. either as card module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>

<seg id="279">The GPS data from a device can be done by gpsman or gpsbabel. you need to save these data in the GPX format, as it is the only format supported by the module for geographic assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS to extract and correlated data from images and on the GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the length - and string grade or other data, then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the signs described by maps.google.</seg>

<seg id="283">& digious; tries to give you as much control of his work processes, as possible. there are many settings that change the behavior of & digious; click on these settings. the Settings dialog is set into eight pages. you can switch between these changes by clicking on the symbols of the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">This promotion can be displayed on single-embedded preview or image processing. you can put the default behavior of & digious; fixed if you click on an entry in the main picture.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standard didacy and copyright data. these data is written automatically in the respective IPTC data fields. also in case of database synchronization, these data will be written in the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Autortitel is a synonym for author. this field should contain the career drawing of the photographer. this can be certain drawings such as drivers photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a further description for the car field, this is also to be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for provider: use this field to indicate the picture. this must not be the author, if it is a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press; if the picture is a camp photo, then the group or agency will be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC-actions save data to the respective IPTC rim. this is achieved that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of & digious; these metadata can also be imported and imported into & digious; imported without lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image quality as embedded label (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments that you can be read in pictures of other images. attention: with images that are already labeled by the sign & digious;</seg>

<seg id="291">& # 160; digious; supports a number of different image formats and several video and audio formats; to determine which file types & digicame; edit, you can add the file extension to this list, which has not added any of these extensions; it is ignored by & digious;</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Update from each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminance of & digious; can be set on this page on the default values. however, if you are switched on the lights. however, the option & quot; In the whole picture size, you should only use easier computers. if you have one, then you can get better picture results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default the image processing has a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer another color, you can select this here. you can switch the tool bar when you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or light colour in the picture. these colors are set here. in the picture the picture can be switched between F10 and F11 and switched off.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling, it is meant that the images are encoded at a higher resolution of luminance as in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia to the next explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG-compression, you can reduce the size of PNG-files. this operation reduces the image data more time to spin and unpack. if you have a fast calculator, you can set this value to a high compression. therefore means 1: a low and 9 a high compression ratio.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF files, you can compress the Deflate -compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not have influence on the image quality, since the deflate algorithm works fun.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss-loss JPEG 2000 files, you can save fun-free. even if you have the loss of loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph was not yet supported, metadata were not yet supported, but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digious, the image processing was only a picture-viewed for photos. currently, it is very fast to manipulation your photos. with this dialogue, you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard rate is that all green pixels are equal to ultraviolet light, when using this option, this distinction creates a bit soft, eliminates this option with a minimum loss of details. this option draws the image a little soft, eliminates the 2x2 lattice patterns with VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance is used in the camera. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is a fixed paint machine that was photographed on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors has the effect that underexposed photos in four steps more detail in the top-lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the nickname, so that the parts of your images are embedded in the settings, as continuous white in the settings. the setting colors are produced, as they generate a few unusual results in different roatons. at least you can try some parts of missing information from the contesters.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general is not as fast saturated as green and red. & they try to redesign the missing green and red shares from the still not satisfied blue pixels. of course, this is a question, how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you will get the possibility to set a level. here's a value of three compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the Luminance value to your taste. you probably need to set him somewhat higher than the default 1. however, this may also be used in the image options of the & digious; -image processing. to keep the time for the demoosaicing, you should be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">An demoosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial image sensor that provides many cameras and the one matrix color pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digious; and DCraw set you three alternatives at your disposal: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD-Interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm created by DCraw. however, it produces color facts on the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with acceptable results.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the colour grape of your lentils, you can put the red and blue corrections here. this is certainly the best method for a color of soft correction, as you are performed during the pipe conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions as it should be given. there is also LCMS and & digious; information about color information from a colour space in the other, so that colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Issues if a picture is opened in picture-processing / color management module will start with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folder click here the folder such as / usr / share / dev / ICC or / home / user / user / user / user / users / ICC, where you can store all your profiles. & digious; this folder was investigated during the Starts.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC profiles you have the option & quot; standard squot; for your profile. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color administration view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your pictures are not managed to the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profile should fit to the camera manufacturers and model that you can use. not all profiles are contained in the same way. currently, the crab Gamma does not contain any color mapping or gammacorrection. currently, dcraw Gamma does not need to carry out converters at 16 bits of depth. this means that you need to carry the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are further options like the soft-proof-profile, with which you can emulate a picture of one device. this is very useful before you can print image, as your printer can work a smaller color than your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated, instead of looking forward to the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is fairly obviously what colour profile for them are intended for them. unfortunately, there is no table of cameras and profiles together with the models of Canon. this answer is of course unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon Profiles can recognize the style for the destination: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for portrait, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & KDE; Image Plugin Interface. it is an interface supported by a series of & KDE; image scans and image processing is supported; many modules support, which are written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you can see a list of the available modules. choose out of which you want to use, and these modules will be uploaded as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition, you can also see some of the text context menu.</seg>
<seg id="323">"" "short command for tasks that can be carried out of modules can set up in the menu under settings short command." ""</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) about KIPI modules you can get through the KIPI project at http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the Diashau should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjust the time between the image crossings, usually 4-5 seconds. the other checkboxes switches the metadata or out, which are embedded at the bottom end of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">Camera features show on the left side a list of all cameras supported. on the right side there is a button automatic detection, which tries to make sure that the camera is connected properly, switched on and in image display mode. there are currently default, USB- and USB / FireWire-Mass memory.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can put the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage camera. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire-mass storage camera from the camera. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera / mnt / s, specify at which you hang your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use & digiplug your digital camera with & digiplug; you have to connect the camera to your computer, and turn it in the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out whether & digious; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera models and port manually after you have set up your camera, your camera appears in the menu camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this will be displayed in the menu cameras of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert more than one camera.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option Open dialog for the move of &gt; Pictures in the trashings, you can set the discussions of & digious; when deleting a photos into an album. in the cuttings of a photos and deletion of a album, you will find further details.</seg>

<seg id="335">Various color schemas can be used in & digiplug; in order to adjust the main window to your taste. these settings can select the settings design from the toolbar. a preview of available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in a new design for & digious; you will find further information about this tutorial in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digicame; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use this to view your photos and improve the image processing menu on the preview of a picture or select the context menu of preview and Edit menu / Edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing includes a range of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & digious; so you are not part of your distribution. more information about the KIPI modules can be found in the photo editing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A Status Bar at the bottom edge of the window, the filename, current file number, magnifying factor and current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge and among them the tool bar for quick access to the most common functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The processing functions of image processing change your photos. however, the original photo will alter, before you have used the original photo or use the button Save from the tool bar. note that you can't recover the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should update a copy of your image before you change it. this can save you to store Save as possible.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the picture, you can restore the original image by using the File Recovery button or restore the button Restore restore the image editing in the tool bar. you then lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any action of image processing can be revoiced or recovered. the last action can be revoiced by adding editing revocal or re-manufactured by editing the Edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you often use this, the keyboard abbreviation, Ctrl; -z can turn back and reproduce Ctrl; -Shift-Z for reproduce.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you prefer the & LMB; over the back-up or restore button in the toolbar at the moment you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all the actions will be processed and recovered.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you start the picture, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by clicking the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image below or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes at the latest photo, you are asked if you want to store it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can put in the photo in which you get Ctrl; mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the call menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">In order to adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the tool bar: magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen Mode shows the photo in full screen mode. you come to the normal view that you would like to use the Esc button. if you don't like this, you can call this in the Settings dialog box. see the main window. see the section for setting up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print image and print the standard & KDE; print dialog. you can customize the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or full sentences. all images can choose from your selection. you will only select the pictures with the default methods and choose from the menu album Export Printer. if you follow the assistant, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digiplug; the main window has a side bar at the right edge, which is important information and actions for selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation line, even in the image processing. it is displayed if one of the five riders is clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple click on the same rider lets the sidebar appear and disappear again into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the label view, you can add labels with unlimited size or insert. note that the text is UTF-8 compatible. that means all special characters are allowed to be used in the EXIF- and IPTC- Fields, so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated up and special characters are formed after 2000 characters. if you wish to use the IPTC labelling in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After which you have commented it either, use either the button user or change to the next picture, which will be saved then.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the user button there is a button More. with this, you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, this is always done if you have selected the metadata setting, which is always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section evaluation shows a evaluation scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting lines. it can only be applied to the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard abbreviation. to rate multiple images at the same time, select this from and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The assessment will be written in the IPTC field. coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword shows a search box for the words of keywords, the sample tree and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this & digious; session of the sample.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword is dynamically adapted to the given search word. you can quickly limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further improvement in the input of sample in a picture series. if you have entered different search words, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding checkboxes in the tree. the key words of a image are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures are selected in the main screen, and select a keyword in the keyword, this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection, if you want to add a selection with a keyword, please read the sample filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keynote filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar with their album, - data, sample and search results are used, only the cut quantity of these two are displayed. all search words are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop several pictures in the main view. if the keyword exists already, you can simply drag it out of the right sidebar and put it on the selection. then a dialog appears if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example the main window shows the pictures at one calendar day. the sample filter has been selected on one calendar. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right hand-tree was put into the selection and put it there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place at any start of the program. it can also be switched off under the settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and determine that it's a or should be, you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry, searching in the database. this may be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string, which is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can define a Extended search over all the elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options will see as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr are not listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly met & digious; s concrete implementation was adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why a colorfully-managed workflow is a predictable variability of which actually photographed or fed colors. with a colorfully workflow, you can reach the colors on your monitor from your camera or scanner and the colors that you want to print or publish the colors of your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme is coming on color management, everyone wants to press how to press buttons for the results. unfortunately, colour management means to provide you sufficient background information about color administration. in addition, links with lower information will help you meet your own informative decisions.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflows all six below criteria must be fulfilled, then you don't worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are calibrated on a monitor which is calibrated to the high RGB color space. (further information see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image expenditures are per e-mail or the web, where the RGB of de-facto is standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if, RGB so well works and the life for all so easy, why should you use another color space and make your thoughts about paint spray ng?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the Limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colors we really can see below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the hunized region, and the colors in the RGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color flowers, so you can visit Bruce Lindblooms page and click on information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to alise my monitor when I decided to work only in the RGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you are working in the sRGB color space or not, you need to switch to your monitor the circle. if you're working as the color space of sRGB, you have to use either your monitor on the sRGB standard callibrieren, using a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before you try a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The features normalize, unequal, automatic uploading and contrast from the menu correct Automatic correction will try to make the best choice of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects, to see what's best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize the controls: this method is scalable to the entire image, so that the dark point is black and the brightest point as it is possible without changing the color. this function frequently is a magnetic correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Like this method, this method adjusted the light factor of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity is as flat as possible. sometimes, the same very good results achieved in the improvement of the image, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that causes a wonder at a picture or it was destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogrammar area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of a picture by the lowest and highest values of all values in between. this is only visible at balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digious; is a semi-automated tool to perform the white balance of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly restricted because of a colour space with 8-bit per color. if you can easily carry out the white surface in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, so your possibilities will drop to correction.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm created by the copyright of Pawel T. Jochon. they start the menu entry colors white down the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand, both the original image as well as the preview of the target image are adapted. if you want to see the original whitish again, then click on the subwindows.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the Luminance of the Pixels under this marker is shown as vertical line at the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above is a histogram, that once you change a parameter, once you have a parameter. this histogram is very useful, even in well lit images, most pixels very small Luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is called.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadows adjust the shading rails of your photos or even down dimms.</seg>
<seg id="401">With the above-mentioned checks, you should use the colour temperature pipette. press this button and afterwards somewhere on the image preview for calculating the color temperature of the white balance. on this type, the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">Additionally, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overflow indicator increases the colors if more than a color channel of the Pixels is overexposed.. you will display the combined result in white colour. this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons saving as well as loading make this. any adjustment of the white balance you have set you to store it in a text file and reload later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button preferences supports all filter values again to their standard values and the associated neutrals. note that also neutral settings will be displayed as your original. if you store this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the codication depth per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is better suited for high quality images. this coding requires more plate, calculating time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool gives the same dialogue like the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assigning colour profiles. colour tonholes can be carried out by the subwindows to the brightness. a detailed manual for the use of colour profiles can be made to the chapter of color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colors. this tool provides an integrated way to save several color channels simultaneously, so that you can always use it for several photos. this is useful if your camera or your scanner will always require the same error, and you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool at Gradation, that you can find a gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug; tool color effects gives you four color effects, a solar effect effect, a Velvia filter, an neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar merisation, also Sabatier, also known as a partial pressure of the image. this was the effect that the brighter areas of darker and the colors were inverted. the result was a partial negatively of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar polarization. at approx. 50% intensity shows the image what is chemically possible. another increase will eventually create a negative image that is so not on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar-effect effect. the original image is the (1) and the treated intensity (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from the saturation that it makes a stronger contrasting effect that makes the colours brilliant and glowing. try it easy to embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the market name for an optimized colour film produced by Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth picture structure. Velvias strongly saturated colors are also some photographers, especially those who are hardly able to date landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates neonlight on the contrasts. the parameter level controls the brightness of the results and the shooting repetitions the strength of Neonlight. in large images the filter can load the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual to correct the color concrest and the luminosity of the photos. all your alignment can be pleased with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result, you can use the button Ok and you are used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you have a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the converted problem: too much saturation. also in this case, the tool is able to increase the saturation instead of increasing it. all the changes you can perform in preview. if Him do you like the result, you can confirm the changes using Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple leukic / contrast / Gamma, the tool is extremely complicated. even if the dialogue to this tool is very complicated, you need for the application purposes only the area of the slider. concrete the three slider below the histogram-program.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three slider can be moved in, to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright fields.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the knob and to consider it as the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamically updated, based on the image settings. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this select box can be adjusted if the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis is frequently used. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram of a single column is dominated. in this case, the logarithmic sheet is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knob: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, commonly called Gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three tweezers can be used in the preview of the original image, in order to adjust the inputs of the shade, medium and bright tones. furthermore, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Outset: the output value allow manual values for each area. there are also two knob to change the output value, e.g., the compression of the output can be used, for example, to create an extremely easy picture as the background, while something else can be seen in the background.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: in this button the image values will automatically be set automatically depending on the intensity of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as well as loading: using these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and re-loaded later. the Gimp level is used again.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you are using these mode and use three colorimets, the input will automatically be adjusted to all shadows, means and sun tones. please click the preview of the original image for Rotor, Green, Blue and Luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overflow indicator controls all colour channels to view overexposed pixels and display the combined results of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the alignment of the procedure applied to red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and Alpha channel, as well as the output are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and the correct picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be dynamically modified in dependence on your settings. on the right side, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modification channel: this selection box allows to set the channel be changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, two symbols are located between a linear and logarithmical view. for pictures taken with a digital camera, the linear mode of a constant colour creates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps in this case.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you postpone a wedge to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones can be corresponded with dark sayings and associated with the corresponding image pixels.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marking. if you want to change this marking on the area you want to change the original value. create a point on this line and move it to and off until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as well as loading: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any turn that you can create in the file system saved and later loaded. the file format is the Gimp spa format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you want to create this method and the three colorimets buttons automatically create the checkpoints of the curve for all channels of the shadow, medium and sun tones. if you want to use the color, click on the original screen to set control points for the rotor, green, blueprint and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option censescalator controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that has been corrected in the luminance channel. shot and sun sound has been put on the curves and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the correct (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel Mixer of the & digicame; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel Mixer is another highly developed tool around the colours of the pictures. you can process it from the menu colors Channel Mixer of the Image Processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first Note how to correct the channels by using the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview of. the original can be viewed compared to your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red markers. if you place this in the picture a vertical line in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: controller for red, green and construction allows you to mix these channels. if you are also able to keep the appropriate colour components, as the channel Mixer is used to reduce the creation of great black-white conversions of your photos. try the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix monochrome, the reduction of a colour in a visible noise that comes from colour space, which is not shown at the same place in color channel, and whose noise is not unlike any channel. if that's the case you can improve your monochrome conversion as a result in which you need to reduce the farthing first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The store as well as loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any Mixer setting can be saved and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overflow indicator controls all colour channels to view overexposed pixels and display the combined results of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re-adjusted. the original image is activated under (1) and the working image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white-photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a step step, as colour images can be converted to the computer. also with a set of movie roller profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanQ Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scenarios and fits particularly good to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange image: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, marine scenes and air photos. similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) orange image.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotary filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatically celioneffects and can simulate a moonset of the day time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotate filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow liner filter. this is the most natural color correction, and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Seppon: this creates warm light and medium tones. this is very similar to the process of extermination of an printer and recovery in a Septic. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">The & digicame; tool texture, you can apply decorative textures on an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your picture, regardless of whether it is a color screen or not, you can look it like a painting of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a wall image on a wall. the menu entry image texture can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone this parameter to the right, the depth of the deep or three-dimensional texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textual effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image has been shown (1) and changed (2). the relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">Using the & digiplug; the frame can add a decorative frame to be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of an argument to keep the boundaries of a photos is not easy task. an opportunity to keep his attention is to put an decorative frame. this is a psychological Barbarrier to the moving eye. under the frame you can add the module from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you set the desired frame type for your picture. immediately converted the image with a thin frame and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), it is ideal for a decorative three-dimensional frame and decoratively adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is limited by 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This is bigger than the original finish line will be larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for the printing of the pictures, especially if you have used the tool Folders.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can attach easy-to-format text in a picture at any place. this will also work in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text area, orientation, color from the colour space and the character set with his features like you need. at the end you can simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background. the image is finished.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting which you have chosen for your text can be changed until you have saved on the button "OK". after the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">Using the digiplug; tool Stencil allows you to put a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu picture templates apply in image processing can be used to create templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For templates there are no restrictions concerning the size and orientation. you need to add the PNG file format and should add your template of the & digious file; you simply send a email to the & digious file; mailinglist digious-Users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for first time, you need to put your stencil folder with the button base folder in a dialog. choose the folder where you have to retrieve the stencil files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for templates has been set to a building that reflects the folder structure of the stencil. selection of a folder will be updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview you will find three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button increases the following image. it is centered around the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this button resized the below picture below. it is centered around the mouse. if you want to use the template on the whole picture, you'll need to scroll the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to use the template on your picture. the picture will then be adjusted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicame; three different tools for sharpening. each of you has privileges in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpenes is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but creates particularly in dark areas, gradient pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unshark mask is working on the contrast of the edges to look like a painting. indeed, it is not a bit more psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by copyright of Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">It is possibly the best of the three, because it really improves the sharpness. it's a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus and most digitalised images need a correction of the sharpness. this is that the same phenomenon must be summarised as the resolution. the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points will be printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG pictures often has been used to use internal sharpness. images in the shell format, however, have to always be offended in the processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner apply a sharpness filter during the reading of the image. if you deactivate this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by simply sharpening a photo with the sharpening score. you can correct sharpening with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should cautiously deal with this, as the results are not very natural, the sharpness increase the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, you can learn more information about the menu entry. under Refogen you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too tight. the solution, the image a little soft, is much easier than it. use the tool for softness correct and try something with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview can help the image. the preview window shows the image of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tested first. an increase of the radius or the amount amplify the effect. if you produce the unsharpness mask, noise and impression of grats in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius will feature a lot of pixels on each side of a edge through the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore sharpen images at best in its final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the illustrated picture one of the original. therefore, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling is a fraction from the maximum RGB value and the difference-amount. you can define a minimum difference to this way for an edge of the filter. in this way areas are avoided between the tones of sharpenalties and therefore avoided errors in faces, Himmler and water surface.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp mask filters. the original image is the (1) and the painted picture is applied (2). unsharp masking was applied with a radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiplug; the focus focused on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright of the protected dealtation filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool is trying a picture to & quot; refocusability. this is better than try to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique named FIR Viennese Filming. it can usually start better results as unsharp mask. you can start from the menu by using colors Refocus on the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular flap works much better than the Gauge's flap, which leads to the mathematical outcome as well. the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauge's Fitting is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels. the causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular area. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images, the default value should set 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image should be extremely blurred, but then on sanctuary.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase of correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation is reduced the sharply effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filters: an increase of the room filter can help you. the filter can accept values of 0-1. however, values higher than 0,1 is very bad. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 is the image quality very bad. a good value is 0.03. a high value is still further contamination.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauge's sharpness. in most cases you should use this value to 0, in most cases you should use this value to 0, so you may need to increase the correlation and / oderate filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Mat size: this value specifies the size of transformation matrix. a increase of mat size can produce good results, especially if you choose great values for the circular flow or the Gauge's sharpness. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any arbitrary parameters will be set to you for later and then can be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all the cuts, colour and intensity applications on the picture before you use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much surgeries changes that not immediately visible, but later left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read pictures and compressed, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masks produces better results as sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp masks in a major neighborhood as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it has to create unsharp masks always. even under optimum conditions it can never indicate the effect of the imsharpness. it is practically the result of the FIR Viennese Filters always just as good as the Unsharpenance Mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better than the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small unfocused picture, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp colour screen has to be corrected. this picture has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due on unsufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methodology of sharpenance structure in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator Glamping puts the unsharpenance of the range of darkening in order to generate a natural Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tinted allows a adapted paint for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool picture error correction is one of the most developed tool, in order to remove the desired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inside algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different default settings as a starting point to simplify the restoration. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailed maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of details. a small value leads to a smooth glass deposit and details sharp. a value of 0.9 should be found so that no sharpenance is necessary. please note that the detailed rules should always be subordinate to the direction of the direction.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction dependence of alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly into all directions, while a value is located close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a high value of similar pattern. JPEG Artefakte will be best fixed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor via alles. p then define the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value to the degree of space in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the greater amount is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if it is difficult to create geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: can be done as often the algorithm. usually lasts 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step width since [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha small is selected, it should also be small, so that small angles can create a long runtime. so, you should select this value as maximum possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrating stride length [0,1, 10]: integrating stepper in pixels. you should use the value small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing, and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation use: the more on quality which you will receive by selecting this option is just small. it doubles the duration. we therefore recommend it to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as well as loading make this. any setting of image errors can be stored in a text file and re-loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image error correction is comparatively very fast at work. but it can still take very long and pull a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button shutdown.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how picture error was removed with little artefacts. the module will be applied on a photo that in Guatemala city has been used with an analogue camera that caused by a bad film storage during the journey. the original image is under (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digious; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a protected property algorithm by Peter Heckel.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filter to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens can be removed too. it can also be used to remove senses from the camera or Moirety; effects of pictured images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensors of digital cameras, you can read this tutorial in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grain size that can be removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindows details and the subwindow advanced settings can remain in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. great values increase the time specified by the filter, and the color is moved about the picture and the color in it is smoothed and so that smaller flaws were adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: adjusts the sharpness to adjust the filter into the front of the filter. if it is increased, you may change the edges. if the value is high, the adaptive filter details cannot be adjusted anymore, the adaptive filter details can no longer receive and noise or dirt.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. if it is too strong, the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, you can easily remove the whole noise or noise peaks. set it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance entolerance of the image. we recommend either color or light density to improve a picture. these settings can not affect the smoothing process through the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or light density to improve a picture. these settings can not affect the smoothing process through the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker ranges which are typically stronger, but polluted the shattends.</seg>
<seg id="541">Shock absorption: controls the adjustment of the Phasenjittering absorption. this value is defined as quickly the adaptive filter radius on variations of luminance. when he is high, appear on the edges, noise and Phasenjitter appear on the edges. it can remove space-sharp and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and loading: these buttons are used exactly. all parameters for the noise reduction which you have set, can be saved in the file system and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how the noise reduction of your life can change. the original image is marked with (1) and correct with (2). the noise reduction was applied to the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a painting for your purpose. the solution, a little soft to draw, is fortunately much easier than a picture with the menu entry and experiment with the menu. the preview window shows the effect of this operation to your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digicame; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools by photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter to restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of wanted artifacts from your images. it is very well adapted to immerse Gauge's noise, crushing, compression, compression, compression and local mistakes. the smoothing is done along the image contours and gives the content as it gives the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for colour and textual errors. the textual operation is carried out with another tool, which was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / franchisel and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefakte reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a lossless compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that are uncompressed in uncompressed image. this setting is intended to correct this problem.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons store as well as loading make this. each setting of photo restoration can be saved and re-loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. but it can still take very long and pull a high CPU load after itself. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with equine noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Minolta (TM) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO was taken. you can recognize the notorious film grain on the faces. the original image is below (1) and correct under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below, you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures will be applied to an old colour photo taken with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts and the photo paper. the original image can be seen under (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digicame; tool Hotpixel allows the hotpixel of photos that have been used with a CCD camera to remove eight. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project that are protected by Martin Dickp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are particularly with high-quality raw material photos, because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels; and "quot; bright pixel clock; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the assistants with the button darkeness. the tool will recognize automatic the hot and bright pixels. these will be highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it's important that you can record the dark image directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the matching dark image to the correct picture. an automatic processing of the dark image will see the bad pixels. please note that the assistant to see the last dark image and reload this automatically in the next meeting.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview can help you within the picture the result correct. the preview window shows the issue of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all fields of view.</seg>
<seg id="560">Choose a area to preview the defective pixels on preview and the results of the Filters. then select the best filter method to interpolate this pixel blocks. these are the following filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: it will be an average of the neighbouring pixel. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 pixel, are used for calculating a bi-linear surface (2-Dim) or a group of linear curves (1-Dim), and then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixel are used to calculate a bi-square surface (2-Dim) or a group of square curves (1-Dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are used to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-Dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1-Dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel-correction on a colour photo, from a defective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, applied. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digious correction; vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e., exposed corners to correct a image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the medium and large photo format, you can not illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignetting-. instead. (shady) it reaches the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that can reach the sensor there. teleobjective clearly show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he also has disadvantages. many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 when the aperture filter, which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lens should also use, also with center filters, a opening of f / 16 or smaller because otherwise unsharpensive movement are created.</seg>
<seg id="569">Using the large exposure areas of today's film and color scanner, digital cameras and film Scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter, which is done without these filters, the transformation of a Centerfilter should be applied to an image. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three rafts, you can control the vignetization correction filter and check three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of luminous intensity at the point of the largest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, equivalent to an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1, or randomly to compensate a greater degree of vignetization, reduce the density by a greater degree of vignetting.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leukstarch, contrast and Gamma-Settings: the editing of the image with the Vignetization correction is reducing the luminosity of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target with these options. the regulator must only increase positive values, as you need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a more fine tuning of the target image, so let the values for luminosity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation of the & digious; image processing from the menu Color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction of a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignettes in corners and (2) correct image. a leukiller and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digious; lens cutoff is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses in photos. it uses a protected property algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool operates with geometric distortion. coloured distortion is not corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree is the general geometrical distortion of lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circuit effect, but flat on the edges. this correction will not be applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the arrow corrected the remote corners to the second degree. if you combine these two geometrical distortion is almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion part of the distortion. with negative values, gradients can be corrected and positive values of the distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth degree. this value is stronger than the edges in the middle of the picture. most of the lentils has the "corners" of the parameter of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and performs a correction of the first gradient. negative values increase while positive the image will be smaller.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighter: this value adjusted the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">In order to help you the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview the distortion correction. the values that you use for your image are saved and used as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonnage or ciential correction should be carried out before any incutting or size changes. best, you make this correction as all first. if you need a picture to re-cut and then perform a fraction correction might be the effect of the falsely.</seg>
<seg id="586">In order to help you the best correction will provide you to view this tool a vertical and horizontal relief line. move it into an important place, like e.g. the sea level or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. in connection, you can correct the grains / ciential distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">When you correct a pickled distortion, the resulting image will have black edges. you can remove this with the slicing tool in the menu transformation from the image processing or via the zoom regulator of this dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images the tin-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step is for some pictures of the front, frame and paintings, it is the perspective so correct that all angles in the picture 90 degrees have. note that when you have the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonnage correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the Gimpcucumi.org website. the filter reproduces Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">On the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Under the preview you can simulate two parameters for film grain and film sensitivity (ISO). if you simulate the gradient texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO controller changed the amount of film grain and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in the conversion. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter color channels are mixed to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes it not to apply the effect on black / white photos because the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filmeektes used on a landscape photo of New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the extended picture below (2). the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of Aura in the nickname.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug; Filter volume is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the movies, the manufacturer big silver grains of photemulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film volume effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets rid of daily life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, grainy sight especially in your monochromen photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to the intensity of intensity and granularity of the body. the default value is, although often higher values need to be set to ISO 2400. if you still need more baskets, you can use the filter repeatedly.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of film-grading effect on a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digicame; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice look like a oil painting. natural pictures and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knobs in order to influence this effect. the upper elects the brush size between one and five. thicker brush are better suitable for large images. smoothing the smoothing or, from the other side, consider the hinges.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the box is marked with the (2). pinout size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and glasses 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digious; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradient to create a cabbage burning. images whose gradients vary slowly. therefore it is helpful to imagine that scene you would have voted to match you. this would be good pictures to start.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knob with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob elects the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast (glass deposit).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon filter filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digious; Filter engraving forms your image in 3-D, as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a protected property algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digicame; Filter engraving is a fast tool to return your images with a 3-D effect. it works very good in pictures with a simple structure. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image in a gray, mondared landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the modified image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by distorted effects. it uses copyright algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave height 1: divides the picture in cells and look it as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave height 2: analog to the wave blocks 1 the image is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can stop this effects at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo in an artwork by unsharpness effects. it uses copyright algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unshark: wipes the picture along the cardboard lines. this simulates the unshark camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial unsharpness: wipes the image by rotation of the pixel by a focal point. this simulates the unsharpness of a turning camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance of distance: wipes the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera se. the object seems to come back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement of motion: wipes the picture through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the unsharply linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Turnout Unshark: wipes the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreaming and shiny focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour-photos or add a warm and subtle bulbs.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schüttelegraph: wiped the picture by accidental shift of pixels and simulates the unsharply moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent unsharpenance: the colour is shown in the picture and wipes these without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it to the colt with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore break this calculation always with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The shelves are a nice small tool to make regentropes on your image. this gives it natural your images a great look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn protected by legally protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Dripping size allows to change the size of the drops. since the dripping size is not automatically increasing with the size of the image. number changes the number and density of drops. fish stocks changes the optical effect of drop in the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can hold with & digiplug; image processing a range of rain drops. do not use the range of tools in order to stay free of charge. if you start the filter regains, the area will remain free from raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the regimropes Filters. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the painted picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation. the tools can be found in the menu transformations and transformation mirror.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most developed tools in order to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to be smaller is simple. the big question is, how can you cut a picture below and keep the details sharp? how can you find out a picture or guess? the CImg algorithm is used here, make sure a good work. try him and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo set the wrong size, you can alter it on the desired size with the tool size. choose a size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog box is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size uses a linear interpolation method to burn the pixels of interpolation. if you want to increase the pixel image with a better quality, then try the tool for inflating.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spine interpolation to increase the image. & digious; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to say the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the rider new size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Keeping aspect ratio maintained: if this setting is activated, the original size of the original size is retained on the input of the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the greater amount is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if it is difficult to create geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons Save as well as charging are used exactly. each entry for photo can be saved as text file saved and later loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it makes it, but it can still be very long and a high CPU load after itself. you can stop the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see an example of photo shooting by a small color image to double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a commonly performed surgery, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. in order to cut a photo you only need the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and pull off the rectangle, you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you move the mouse button again, the area of the photos will be cut off. thereby, you can change a good overview as your photo. you can move the size of the rectangle to cut off the corners of the rectangle, simply produce a new rectangle using the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">As soon as you are satisfied with the cutting edge, use the button "Cutting button plunge in the tool bar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or Save In the File menu to save the newly designed foto.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area you can change the size of the rectangle by relocating the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio, which you have defined in dialogue, will remain in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool Following the aspect ratio you can specify the orientation as high-format or transverse format. in the high-format, the larger value of the height and in the landscape format is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool Folders the aspect ratio uses a unique aspect ratio. that means it is always equal to whether you can use cm, Inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there exist two buttons to adjust the selection automatically horizontal or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog box you can use the Max. ratio button to cut the size of the maximum possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool In order to cut off the aspect ratio and store its settings, depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical), these settings are stored as default values in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data are reflected the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the compositions help themselves together help you make up your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. as the third-reins, harmonic triangles are oriented toward the diagonal triangles in similar harmonic triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden middle is a division that is on different natural growth pattern, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the bubbles of a sunflower. it dives in all possible things on which we feel beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden Division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used with the old Egyptians and Greeks, so when you used your temple and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you have your paintings, buildings, and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is from Fibonacci eps. 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 34 & etc; from where each number is equal to 1 equal to 1: 1,618 the golden middle. a composition is considered as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle represents liquefied relief lines when you have a picture, and they are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral is used to achieve good results for your photos. compared to the third stage, the golden spiral creates a smooth line of the eye on the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual river on this type.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden spines. it should be something that the eye can move into the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects. this can simply be able to meet its task without the eye.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles are also directed from the above-discussed golden spiral. in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles have no equalizing triangles. diagonal to these lines can be disposed of a static object of dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use gold triangles in order to create your frame, you will create a effect of professional photographers dynamic Symmetry. try your image focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can not reach differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontally reflects and vertically mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can put the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. on this type, you can adjust the color of your current picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture to any angle of any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you want a photo, then it's easy to keep the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the things are turned around an angle; and you can easily fix it with the & digious image. choose Free Rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are given in degrees. you can reset the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module gives free rotation a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse in the picture show around the two lines. now you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot an image, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to repair this is the function transformation from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the function automatic. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a little after the rotation. note the above-above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All performers are carried out by a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be recharged. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty parts that are created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty parts that are created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees along the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right: shows the current angle in degrees along the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees along the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: shows the current angle in degrees along the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image will be slightly dirty. this effect is small but two adaptations produce a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you set the perspective you'll get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. a possibility to transfer this is the picture with transformation from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and left the other part in the opposite direction. this is no rotation, the picture is distorted. with other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallel ram. you can start this module via transformation.</seg>
<seg id="679">Check your image by using the Horizontal angle and the vertical angle. if you click preferences, the angle is set to zero. a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target figure will appear on the right.</seg>
<seg id="680">For your help, a vertical and horizontal line is completed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool set to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After which you have carried out the image will be a little bit wiped out. this effect usually is negligible, but two chings generated twice as much contacting and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After crossing the image has unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to remove this is the picture with transformation from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digicame; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read image formats thus depend on your system and, in some cases such as these libraries have been compilized. in most distributions you will be able to process a large number of image formats with & accessories.</seg>

<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG coaster module is a tool to convert a set of images to a MPEG video in the form of a Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can also be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packets for MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the single pictures you can add a base file in MP2 or WAV of Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can create a background color for the Diashau. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD to create DVD player. to burn the medium you finally can use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to use the pictures that are to be packed into the MPEG-ashau, then you can start using extras MPEG Diaschau to start the module.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are displayed under image files in the portfolio. you can also change the pictures or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are happy with your list, you should select the other settings. the video format may be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. PAL is preset and most probably choose the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">Next step you should specify the time in seconds to specify a picture. the speed of the image is set below. a low value produces very sudden, high contrast with very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set up next. in doubt, you should set them black. in doubt, you can set the name and the path of the generated file you can designate the name of the MPEG-output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you have a audio file named in the name of the audio source file, this will be integrated into the movie. after all settings, you can drink the generation of the movie. depending on the speed of your computer you can enjoy a coffee and enjoy the Diashau when you back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that Kodiers or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages on the right settings.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print assistant allows to print several pictures on a sheet paper in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is for example: make sense to improve or print with the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import your images stored in the RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line mcraw of Dave Coffin. an original file from Him is: expect from dcraw not that it generates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to convert and start the module. the Raw picture conversion window appears in the mode for a single picture. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimise the conversion process. the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used. the key parameters such as Gamma, brightness and Red / Blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can process the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrasting information. if your camera works in RGB mode the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are happy with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename is equal to and just the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged image format, TIFF, reserves all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you want to process your pictures often, or later, you should not use JPEG format, as it only allows a limited number of surgeries before joining the image quality. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you want to select JPEG as memory format, the metadata files stored in the RAW file are stored in the EXIF file in the EXIF information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start converting the conversion button. if you want to break this process, you can stop using this process.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacking processing mode allows you to convert various images to one time. use this mode if you are safe, e.g. by testing on a single picture, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images. however, you have the possibility to automatically overwrite the file. this is useful if they were produced in a previous attempt. a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of a album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the timestamps.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. they can be smaller or enlarge the image of the image.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Din.): normal size change in a dimension. width or height of the image will be selected automatically, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Din.): size change in two dimensions. this option remains unchanged. you can use this option to match your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportionally: not proportionate size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printer preparation: prepares the picture for the photo pressure. the user can adjust the printing resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module, you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the added images in advance. further pictures can draw on the list of sending images and place there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you start the module, the pictures will be displayed with the selected images. you can add more images with a file selection dialog. for the last chosen picture, a preview of the right page is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also draw images on the list of images and add them to the list of sending images.</seg>
<seg id="875">The selected pictures will be removed from the list of sending images from the list.</seg>

<seg id="918">Before HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are described in the three areas of content, layout and purpose. in the following, each area will be precise.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the tracks and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on a photo album; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoelectric album; -Export file will be created on the check page. you will find your shopping information about export-files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Recently, you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to view the viewer without description. for example, all pictures of a party are. please note that all images are exported. you can not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewing.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section, you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most of the display options are unique, which is why not specifically entered.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures. thus, those who want to look at your website and have a monitor which supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no pictures more download for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer's viewer can change the resolution at any time. it can also change your pictures with low resolution that leads to a lower transmission time, browse. if he'd like a picture to appear, he changes to higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this site, place the various folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best select a new subfolder for all your HTML files and select a new subfolder for all of your HTML files.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you must select the main folder where all your pictures will be stored. this folder will be stored and automatically added to the next time. you can select either a folder or select by KDE support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check that these really all are visible for viewing. if you want to select a URL, after the pages have been created, the URL you can click here should be that folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in a wrong file.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in final destination folder you need to copy it manually. thus, the import function you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of current files, but the basic folder where all subfolders are set.</seg>
<seg id="930">The configuration described above have all three on base folder or URLs. in these, a subfolder will be created, whose name you can set in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you're on a family party, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoelectric album; you are, you might want to create a HTML page to viewing the pictures. if you have already taken a HTML page to view the pictures, recording, etc., you have to do with & kphotoelectric album; this work is not yet once more.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & photoelectric Album; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .kim file. you can import them into your database. the image teams are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two types of .kim-files, internal and external. you distinguish themselves if the images are stored in the file or if the images are stored in the file or if you have any pictures together, and this file can be independent, however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can choose a .kim file either directly from the menu file extension... or together with HTML pages, see, create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this is an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file is looking for pictures in a two way. first, the images are searched in the file of the .kim file. if you are searching for creating HTML files, this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following dialog will be described for exporting images that you can call on the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should act around internal or external .kim files. you will find the following three selection options:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the manuals to the .kim file, you have to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option auto-copy to copy the .kim file, copy & kphotoelectric album; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim -files are normal Zip files. since most images have already been compressed with JPEG, and the XML file itself is very small, if you want to compress this, then select the option export file compressed.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum image size limit. if you send your friends pictures, you want to limit the images in full size, as the .kim file would not be very big. here you can say that each image should be higher than 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you want to select a file using Endung .kim from the web browser or from the menu file Import Import..., will import & kphotoelectric album; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to importing importing four steps. first you need to import them to import pictures, then in which folder will import images to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you can personate the category persons of the import file (if you are a Dane), while this category is asked for your database. therefore, you will be imported in the third dialogical file, which are to be imported into the third dialogical file and correspond to which categories are listed in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can view the categories of the current file to the categories of your current database. one example can see you on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be simple to see pictures and see: if you see images, you want to see images of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures, on which this friend is shown.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will find the different steps of (1) fixed the information about your pictures, through (2) the search and watch, up to (3) advanced topics and adjustment possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum has been started as a program for managing your pictures. it was extended and today also cares your videos. in many places this manual is spoken about pictures, but frequently, this also closes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photoelectric album; stores all his information stored in the file index.xml in the top folder of their images. this is an easy XML file which you can copy to a program of your choice, e.g. Normale backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& photoelectric album; notice the folder where your pictures are stored and used this at future Starts automatically. if you want to start another database in & kphotoelectric album; so you want to start another folder with images, you can start & kphotoelectric album; with the option -c. as example: kphotoelectric album -c ~ / Company / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Over the menu entry settings dialog box; set up... come to a window where you can change the settings of & photoelectric Album; in the following section of user manual you will be explained to you the various Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can call the viewing possibilities of preview and options for viewing the viewer. for each setting, you can call an exhaustint to the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described as you can create different properties, e.g. people, places and tags. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">On view the dialogue, which is used to work already existing groups. for each available group you can choose a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were mentioned above. in dialogue options, you can setup full member groups, e.g. all members of a group at once more than in one group instead of all groups of a central glieds.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view of the Settings menu, you can choose to configure your member groups. with the top selection list, you can configure the category. in the left window, you can configure a list with the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& photoelectric album; divides his modular system with other graphics applications such as digiKam and Gwenview. this modular system is KIPI and means & KDE; Image Plugin Interface. you will find on the homepage from Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed via the menu modules. the modules can not be described in this manual because it is not part of & kphotoelectric album; but most modules have a help page that can call you on the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used with multiple applications together, it can be that the modules include & kphotoelectric album; only very little tested. so, you can use the command line with the command &gt; kphotoelectric album demo &lt; userband\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't say, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">Applications that use the modules via KIPI are very different, so it can be a few modules with & kphotoelectric album; not work. this is the disadvantage if you divide functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoelectric album; and other applications that can use KIPI, is that the other applications do not support their pictures. even if & kphotoelectric album; this type of order is not supported, so simulates the order to albums, so you can use the functions with & kphotoelectric album.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulates & kphotoelectric album; the current album which is simple to the current view, so all pictures that shows you the picture preview at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album must include & kphotoelectric album; the modules also has a list of albums. here goes & kphotoelectric album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & photo album, s browser shows the content of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums, so if you want to use the category persons, will do & kphotoelectric album; so do if you have selected persons to view and this module will continue.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoelectric album; not compatible, you can remove this from the list of modules. launch the dialog dialog and select Modules in the Modules, which modules should be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you get & kphotoelectric album; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can see at the top of a menu bar and toolbar. below the tool bar, you can't see any information about your pictures. in the section we will find on this window, now click on the entry images, which shows you an overview with all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kphotoelectric album; is the possibility to see any picture with comments on the picture, where the picture was recorded, etc. you can set any picture either individually or for a larger number of images. if the example on all pictures is shown and all the pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these notes can be used for searching and Browse as you can read in the section. if you wish to see these remarks if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view three lists with a text field by using persons, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoelectric album; as you will always use it again if you are using information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is the slide of the pictures within the list: if you have a family party, and on all 50 images the same 5-10 people can be mapped, so that the used names are moved upwards, which can be moved faster and arrange them faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to receive a alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon for sorting after date on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each picture, you may need to edit all the selected images and provided these pictures with annotations. Click this case simply on the front and back-buttons that are located under the preview of the image.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and you can use the menu additional entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all available in the USA. there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>

<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object-tree and the view of the object features are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the default window configuration, or if you need any other configuration, you can easily save them. you can also store several window orders and simply switch between different instructions.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchored a window over or below one of a view, enter the passer to the top or bottom edge of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, enter the Anfasser to the right or left side of a view. the new view will then be anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you wish to arrange several views over each other, enter the Anfasser in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map series at the top in the views.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you have a scene, you can rename it. & povray; 3.1g for renders, this program has to be installed properly. when this manual was written correctly, was & Povray; 3.5. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">In order to rename the current scene, click the symbol Renders The Symbol Renders in the toolbar or select the menu entry of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of renders. if you want to rename a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can add any many Render-modes, from a fast preview of up to full images in highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the Symbol The Render settings in the toolbar or in the menu View Render modes... select the following dialog will open:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can set any name any name, but it is a name that can recognize the characteristics of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the straight image. if you want to renew only a small area of the image, select the check box section and enter the picture section to the Renders in the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination with quality, you can select the properties tab. this is used by a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflection lighting. a detailed description of the Render properties can be found in the user manual & Povray;</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is reduced with only one beam, you can create different errors. these pictures often have a Moirè samples or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technology called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, images with this feature is better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on Anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as standard is a adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because every pixel is still subdivided and adaptive because the recursioning depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray pursues a beam of pixel. if the difference between the color indicate the specified pixels, both pixels will be calculated by 4x4 additional points, with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixels. if the difference between the colour values specified, then the pixels will be divided into 4 subpixel, which can be evaluated individually and placed on further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recitals can be adjusted by depth of depth.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another possibility to reduce aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. when you turn jittering, changes & Povray; the rays of a tiny amount to avoid regular samples.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of the renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection is calculated. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this cardboard card you can adjust whether the Alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the pertinent beams have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; -console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; -scene to import, select the menu entry file... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently, & kpovmodeler is currently not yet the full command reception of & Povray; if you occur when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog box shows a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you don't want to support source code in & kpovmodeler; write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawning and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can extract objects from object-tree to export the source code for & Povray; it adds the source text of the object into the opened text file in the Editor, simply select the source code in the Editor and draw it in the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and insertion in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor, you can also insert source text for & Povray; also included.</seg>

<seg id="1064">The colour of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type characteristic.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object of points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can find here the grid separated for slipping, scaling and swivings.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values indicate a more accurate wire model, making better time for the displayed objects, but require more time to renders. for some objects such as the sphere, you can set the detailed level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross a detailed projection for extended projections, all wire model views are used, all projections are used. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions and the vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to the projections, but requires more time to renders.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, there will be a wall behind the objects. the wall is shown in a chess brettp from two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you view the ground, there will be a floor below the objects. the floor is shown in a chess brettp from two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When you check out cantonal antialiasing method, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for the rendering of scenes. the values for depth and threshold can be adjusted. detailed information regarding the parameters can be found in the Render-modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the section window orders, you can create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination field standard window system: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler, used the chosen window regulations at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of submitted window orders shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement, you can create with the button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be clearely and cannot be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views of the chosen window regulations. new views can add with the button Add and delete selected views with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column you can create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with cartons you get a map card view together with the previous view and easily anchored the view in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; and now you would like to follow more specific knowledge of both programs. if you can follow all steps in this guide, you should easily create the ultimate but simple scene, amongst others: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should keep the following warnings carefully before you make sure that you can only use a black screen. if you use a 3D program for first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set any camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you will receive a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't add light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you will receive only a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have all flawless installed, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following preset window rules:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to learn the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar. please read the documentation that you can expect to expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will have to use this menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also the application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow these instructions, you'll need to remove all objects from the object-tree. select the scene and then select Edit menu to Edit. so you will now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera shows the whole scene that you generate. in particular, note the scene from the camera view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the renderns of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object-tree now contains a new entry containing the designation camera. if you click on it, see the contents of the view object features where the various parameters of the camera are displayed. in the user documentation to & Povray; find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change anything to the basic settings of the camera, this is later instructions reserved, but notice that the camera has to change the camera in view points, with which you can change the target point of the camera. just click on a control point and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you push the button user interface or press the input, change the wire model views and the object-tree immediately after these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the viewpoint of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many possibilities to create the ground for the scene. you could adjust the box (insert the body Quader) and size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a controversial method for the solution of this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler possibility. you can deploy an infinite layer as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and press the button user or the input. inside the tree, the new name is immediately displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view shows now also the level, if at the moment just as a limited plane. when you rename the scene, the level extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you can see the object tree exactly, you will find the entry for the floor if you can click on the symbol + in front of the object. in this case, you will find the default options for any new object: scaling, rotation and shift. choose one of these options, also changing the possible settings in the view of the object features.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should shift the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just to know some of these parameters. choose the shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Simply select the ground in order to set its material properties. there are many different materials, but select at the moment some notes.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog box will open in which you can select as the object is to be inserted. you can change the name in the object-tree. you can view the name in the self-speaking view (Name = bottom pigment), with one click on the button preview it looks like the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigments do only have a matte black material, because you can always check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview. now, give the colors for the pigment. also there are many possibilities, but now take the easiest way.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't want to see a preview of color on Quader and ball, click on the button user and call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you're right now with one click on the symbol, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course you do not have the color. you need to set two new attributes. here, select this entry twice (you can do this too often, but the chess boards available can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select in object-tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object features:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should you be simply run, as you should have understood the basic work of & kpovmodeler; the ball is just how easy to create the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of the object features you can change the settings immediately. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget the input or push button user), so the ball would turn on the ground, as you have postponed the ground by one unit to downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the renders now makes a strange result: as previously shown, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. set in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you select the ball, you can now refer to a material now. as at the bottom, you give the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select the first subobject and change the name for example in ball pigment. Click on ball pigment, then select one-colour and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach an interesting effects, if you take time to set a few finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on the user or press the input.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness shine effect and reflection already shows good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome surfaces, even if metal is not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of them which offers you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you've learned so much so much you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a Render method to generate a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you have a Scraytracing, the Renderer hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes at the scene, and like atmospheric effects of the light sources in the scene, and how atmospheric effects can act as an example of fog. so the scene pixels is arranged for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see without a camera, the camera is your eye, with which you see the scene. without a light source, you can see anything, the picture is simply black. obviously, any scene needs to be drawn, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog you can select a file which you have previously made with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model or create, the file is inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. it is a new file, you'll need to enter a name and space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">The scene have recovered in the last saved version. all changes have been rejected since the last storage.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can only select this menu only if you don't have saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the most recently reversed command. this menu entry may only select if you use editing.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window configuration and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or writing a new arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you can find options for setting & kpovmodeler;, here you can change the appearance, the shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for Modification of the keyboard abbreviation. you can change or add commands to this option.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog for establishing the tool bar. you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler; add commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is a possibility to adjust rough surfaces without any hives on the surface and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a Bump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometrical forms which can use as blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic body. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color to pixel-based, by application of a picture file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuk show; is a comfortable paintings and browser. the application has a file browser that you can select images to display images.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Pictures can be displayed in a separate window in size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuk show; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can display using the & LMBn button or press Return.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can adjust whether each picture is to be displayed in one of your own window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a certain file, type the first character of filename in browser window. then a small input field appears in the right hand corner. if a matching file name is found, the file is highlighted by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In a dialogue entry - & kuk show; there are five map cards. in three of them, General and Handling and Slideshow, you can adjust the work instructions of & kuk show. in the two others, short command for the browser window, the key pendant for the respective window can be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the pictures will be opened in full screen mode. if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area is filled with the background colour, which you can set further below. default is not a full screen.</seg>
<seg id="1136">If this point activated, invites & kuk show; already the next image in the folder while you still need the current picture. this reduces the delay if you select the next image, and is especially suitable for slideshow.</seg>

<seg id="1185">You should not give the user a feedback when the script can not be executed because of a missing dependence on whether all the required modules are present and use the dialog box that the user does not run it.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin Require 'Korundum' Rescue LoadError error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is Required for this script.'. dialog --sorry '# {error}' 'exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the folder scripts / Templates you will find a lot of presentation scripts in many different languages. you can use it as a basis for your own scripts, or simply click the necessary functions. you will find that the writing of scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP you can exchange your scripts with Amarok and Taxes. the easiest way is the use of command dcop; which should shoot any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most script enables the result of external programs and commands. in addition, the function exec () is used. in this way, dcop &gt; relatively easy to be called. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sends alerts to all current scripts. for this reason, Strings should continuously monitor their default setting and respond to events. of course, scripts can also ignore the events even if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure, specify the script to view the setup dialog. if a script is started, Amarok sets the desktop folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">Trackchange signals that a new piece is used. the script might be & zb; with DCOP functions further information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the unit length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newvolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customizable: submeritemtTitle. contains the path to the selected files of playlist, if a user-defined menu entry can also be used to add the script the DCOP-function dcop amarok (submeritonal Title). in order to remove one entry again, you can use dcop amciscript to eCustomMenuItem (submeritemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok are ended, or if the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do, for example, store data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server. such packets can be compressed as bzip2 (.bz2) which can be easily detected by bzip2 (.bz2) that the user may definitely recognize the archive as a Amarok script.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 only script packages to accept a script with the Advanced-script. for this reason, your script should be just correct.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main proposition must be executable (+ x), the rest to the ladder modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">When your script is finished, you can download it on www.kde-apps.org and hang it to the Wiki scripts page of & amarok; attachments. for your entry to KDE-apps you should use the category amarok; script script.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& amarok; is an audio player for & KDE; & amarok; has many useful and powerful functions, and is still surprising to operate.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & b; Linux). further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos.</seg>
<seg id="1243">AmaroK needs only the package Kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you have to install Kdelibs (including the programs contained therein, because & amarok; requires some of them, for example modules or scripts). we have written a small guide, how to compiled Kdelibs minimum.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as OSD is preceded that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work for example. we try to support amaroK on all platforms, so we use Kdelibs and Qt, because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably, one of your files take a bug in the Taglib library. you can see this bug to the Taglib developers under buggivde.org and hang it to the Caputte file that caused the crash. thereafter, you can erase the file and create the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly seen, that Taglib is crashing: by reading the Meta-Info from this file system crashing. please report this bug to the Taglib developers under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, then try SQLite. the support is in & amarok; is a little mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & amples; used libraries with the same compiler-version. if, B. & amarok; with GCC 3.4, Taglib but with GCC 3.3.x was compiled, then this leads to the editing of meta-information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd, then deactivate automatics, if inactive for... into the sound system, or use at least no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens at a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is important that many programs write data as UTF-8 in meta-information, but it is not known as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / Perl die "The file $argv [0]; use MP3:: Mplib = $MP3- &gt; get _ v2tag; print" error when writing the tags of $argv [0]\ ") $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1254">& amarok; s icons are always active in the status bar (random orbit / repetition / dynamic playlist). this is a well-known mistake in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes, you can see the status Off on grey and half-transparent. please note that in some cases up to three times you have to click on a symbol, until this setting has its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this mistakes: icon Lookup error: Unlocks symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapv K7QPixmap, then check whether amaroK does the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd'phamarca '_ BAR _ grep QT.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any collious Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf so that amaroK first finds the correct version.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are some possibilities. most installation problems clarify in the easiest way through the help of a experts your Unix- or Linux distribution. you can also use help on other users or in the developers. use this forum and the IRC under irc.freenode.net in the Canal # amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for help. please take only one error if you find anything at the Behavior of an error in amaroK itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the launch of & amarok; only an empty playlist appears only. how do music pieces come there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">That's simple. use the file browser on the left hand side and open the desired folder. then drag the files into the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To maintain the surface intuitively, the starting window was converted into the statistic window. you will find it under extras statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The significance of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars are available for the evaluation by users, while the points will be charged automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To evaluate plays in the playlist, the evaluation list must be displayed. Click here with the & RMBn; click on the title track of the playlist and select column. you can also use the short command line Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa-Sink, the device needs to use a blender. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device to the same time and can be reached via a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for Alsa (Software Mixer). see the Help Dmix for ALSA.</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you in search of the problem and a solution. for GStreamer you may need to specify a different sink (e.g. osssink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">That does & amarok; already. don't forget that media must first decoded. GStreamer is the best choice if you read a déor with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decoded them and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS decoding the data first. GStreamer can also output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open the control centre Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable Soundserver with highest priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of sound buffer (call, see next point of FAQ!). make sure that artourapper is adjusted:</seg>
<seg id="1277">With KDE 3.2.x there are problems with KDEmultimedia codecs that can cause disrupted playback. read this error report. read this error report. the use of the sound puffers in your ALSA entry file .asoundrc can also help you.</seg>

<seg id="1279">Probably use the Arts driver. use another driver (the xine driver has been optimized for analyzer, or reduce the size of the buffer buffers in the control centre and sound & multimedia, sound system. depending on the buffer, the less motions respond to visualizations.

<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to change the GStreamer driver, crashes & amarok. why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer, you need to register all components. carry out registers to record all GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if not helps, you can also ask the IRC -Channel # gstreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (finish amaroK before!): - Download you down, compile and install it. then run the module file from GStreamer all ffmpeg files (you will find the module folder with gst-config / gstreamer-config) and run gst register again. start now & amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, codiers and compression rates and helps you to choose the right Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is supposed to go lost, a lossless audio format is needed. besides FLAC, there are also other such as' shorts' or 'Monkey' that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, you lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG likes today have a slight advantage against MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate the differences are very important because both codiers produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not so' free, lame is still delivered with most distributors, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - If only music is to be heard from one computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG-playable devices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - If music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A brief list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for other parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting makes good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = This setting is usually acceptable for most people and most music pieces acceptable to transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset Extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires more than 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of one title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR Joint stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a Title. good enough for music from young people, portable devices and autoosterone systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely do the highest quality, then choose the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information, manually entered or collected by the program automatically from FreeDB via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & kaudiocreator; and the code program to generate the folder and file names and characteristics of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with Kodierprograms there is often a combination of program settings for the Kodierer and these parameters here. the manual or help to the Kodierers explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; titles to the sample (english: day) if MP3s with lame is encoded, the switch -tt is of lame and the title parameters of & audiocreator; the result looks as follows: '-tt {From...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters which can be used (= button name in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the FreeDB file is: a free database, in which the audio CDs can read / enter, so that all the other information can be downloaded / enter into the computer. it is said to note that here only by text is spoken: & CD; title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal but I (Anm of the translation) is not lawyer. however, nobody can prevent that you are given public on the & CD; however, no more or less valuable, so the information can be added to the music company. all information can be saved by a Bummel by a & CD; business, physically, or virtual, can be obtained.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to choose a check box (Send of an address). in this type of configuration, it seems that the email address is not used when checking the data from server (This can only know the programmer that has reviewed the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; for use FreeDB, the geographical zone should be used to use FreeDB, this saves bandwidth on the network and resembles the load between the computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirrors for the online demand of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the entire database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What reading program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that with cdparanoia is used; if you want more precisely, search in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package from the matching distribution must first be installed, if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the rented WAV files, the Kodierer can be chosen and thus select the desired file format. at the first opening, the code for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the coefficient may be used. this is also necessary for the predefined codiers. further information about Kodierer are in the chapter puppy Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodierers, more information about his switches can be obtained through the input of an commands like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console) is replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and readiness of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;). try to retrieve both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give a note what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this may be done just as you proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, everything is understood but somehow are still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-for-step example, and you will get enough information to create those areas, which want to make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, and read everything and our first & CD; we will use MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 stitch (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution, as it is not completely free software, as it is not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, whatever you can do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is possible and that you own write permission (eg; trying to copy with the conqueror anything).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with basic setup of & audiocreator; something which will probably be done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second part describes how to read out a CD; what needs to be repeated & CD; it must be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the well-used coefficient of music (lame) and the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (MP3) as well as we are lazy to use the program with the FreeDB program to download the & CD; data from the Internet download.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change this settings at any time, we will not be able to read them in any reading of a & CD; if once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is given to the reading program so that it can read the & CD; data / pieces can read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive can also be used, so it can also be used on the drive / etc / frod and an attempt with the entries of the device records for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The ticket map general settings. here is no longer to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined here. in our example, everything will be shown as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only for incomplete information, you will be informed if you are informed when using keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and can be downloaded & CD; data automatically via the Internet from a FreeDB computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected during the reading of the & CD; to be connected to the Internet, so that it can access the FreeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is simpler, a & CD; entry was found immediately, if you are unhappy with the database entry and the resulting directories / filename or file name, can be changed easily. the directory and file name is changed with conquilt - &gt; renaming and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & KDE; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">In addition to this example, if you want to install everything manually, then deactivate the selection fields and FreeDB. however, this can be used twice, if you can use FreeDB in off-mode mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first setting. the mode is set up at the following box.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us FreeDB. these are settings for data-demand, for retrieve the & CD; information from FreeDB server via the Internet. how does the system know which data can be released? read the section about FreeDB. put everything in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we don't have downloaded the database, we want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to page freedb.org and look at a mirror server in your proximity. on this way the load is distributed between the computers. however, this setting is however able to work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work as well as the server, as many Firewalls the protocol 8880's standard, is perhaps more lucky with the protocol 80 because the & HTTP; protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to transfer & CD; data to the FreeDB server. the first check box should be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously run pieces: excuse, there is a reason why more than one at the same time when using only one existing drive? parallel it and cook? the author doesn't know, therefore just try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; put out the CD in order to read out the last piece: cross this about the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom files for temporary files: if you cross this file, then you can pass the path / folders that can be saved in which the WAV files are stored. if the box is not enabled, the file will not be enabled, if you don't want to make this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All such as it is on screen photo. the command is something long, under circumstances may need to be blown up to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset Extreme' defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, it is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo. this reached compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the restriction of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can be used when needed. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & KDE; in case of subsequent alterations of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the names of the inputs (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Place the rest as in screen photo. some comments for future use outside this sample:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneous WAV files: with a dual core or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried, more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is, we've just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as standard for any reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section is described as the process of the reading of the & CD; we will build on the hard disk. we will be built in the previous section, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from FreeDB you want to retrieve data from FreeDB. the process of data is described in this section must be repeated for any subsequent & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use one & CD; not included in FreeDB, the screen photos are a little different than the data for one & CD; with successfully deleted by FreeDB files, you will learn the & CD; data manually can be retrieved from the internet instead of which they refer to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, now the & CD; in the drive that was defined in the main window, is switched on.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; identified as audio CD; identified and from cdparanoia can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not happening, you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully picked up by the FreeDB, all titles are already completed and will display the name of the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the case, it is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; Key for your & CD; there is a window built, and you can select the database entry, which your opinion is best to your & CD; fits in your opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you don't have the check box for automatic query output of FreeDB (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for Settings), you can also solve this manually by selecting the first Knopfs in the toolbar. if you have no local database, but you will need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photo, the piece of the piece in the first row of the "actuator title ', the rest of the data in the input field' Album '.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered in the input field 'Update title', unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments inidiac per unit, the comment field of the album will be used for comments using the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful conclusion of the data from FreeDB, the CD editor is not empty, but it is always quite a good idea to check the content of the CD-Editors, so that you are not only happy with the artist and album name (such as all words with big letter or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this is limited to the length of the fields marked for the artist, album and titles of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary area. if you are using ID3v2 tags; this option is set up at the tab code settings; take a look at the code 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the day information of generated files later at any time with the Tag Editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with him you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags will not be supported by all Kodierers or file formats. see the help of the body to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Just select a record, which is obvious with the style of the unlock CD; this example is not important that we do not transfer the & CD; data just like to read on freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap can be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After selecting 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD Editors appears again and you see that the fields of the album have already been covered with the given data, which we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. specify the item for each case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Please click on the next line in the main window and process you in the same way until you have entered all the titles data of the & CD; entered.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window appears not when you downloaded the data from FreeDB. you're already sorted in one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the tool bar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the item list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-sign before each line of a piece. only the titles are selected. a simple click on the line switches that all pieces are selected, or call the button All pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces at one time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">After clicking on the button select the reading process is started, this window appears to confirm. Click OK and then we will throw a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab orders to change the order window. it is in the left half of the window, directly under the buttons of the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message you can see if you are trying to work with a codierer, which you have not installed yet. pieces that were not successful with a red 'X' in the Conlist list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folders for the TMP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example. did you checked if you have a write access to the folders for temporary files and destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear that the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The job 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3. thus, reading and encode parallel. please note the status in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration options to suppress this behaviour. the only one appears, the number of parallel processes is unclear. the computer used with a AMD64 seems to read and encode reading (however, two different tracks).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is encoded and a third order is encoded in the queue of the Kodierers. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window ends.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator; you need & KDE; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the coefficient of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Karaokespieler of & KDE. in addition to others, with real-time grafic and karaoke-real-time collection of texts, some features which have not have other & UNIX; -MIDI players did not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS - und & KDE; also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound repository, which is needed for GUS cards. Alsa will be embedded as soon as it supports a sequence.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing colour, making it easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical display of activity of any MIDI channel by using the numeric keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & drop to drop in & KDE; any MIDI file from a & conqueror; -window can be placed on KMid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files (recitals or texts). KMid determines the process automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Seat support. if you finish & KDE; during the recording of a song, Kmid will kick off the same song once again with the same song.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI Synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can open... from the menu file. it appears the usual file dialog, with which help you select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also open a file from a & conqueror; -window to the & kmid 'window. this works also with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a music piece, open it and confirm the button playing in the toolbar, select the entry play from the menu piece, or betting the Leertaste.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts, as soon as you go to the & kmid; -window. (with several pieces they are added to a collection, and then played another one another.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid; play a piece, you can jump on any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played to quickly or slowly, you can click on the arrows to the left and right the speed of the speed. to get back the original speed, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The Levians has two tasks: if a piece is played, a pressure on the empty space, like a pressure on the button pause, or the exit of menu entry in the menu, thus break the playback. if no piece is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be saved on two types in a music piece. some pieces use text convocation, others use lyrics and lyrics and other both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can adjust which events will be displayed, and even better: the event type is automatically selected, so that you need to adjust nothing manually. if you want to manually adjust the karaoke text, you will always have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other kind.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up a event type, choose from the menu settings the entries or recital lines. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you want to summarize. these will be part of the series after playback. in this section, how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find this menu under the item Organize.... Click New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than a collection, you can set the profits in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">Into the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application this collection will not be stored. consider this if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In order to add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there, you can add a song. there, again, you can select the file dialog, with which help you select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song, depends on the setting up to a collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic add to the collection, a piece when opening (when opening file or drag & drop) is automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not activated, when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and eert. this collection will then be added to the unopened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you'll need to open the collection manager, select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removal.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the sequence in which the songs will play back. if you select the series after the menu sequence of the menu collections, songs are played in the order, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove or random order in the menu, the order will be reset.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select the button Next song, the entry next song from the menu, or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump a song back, select the button one piece, the entry to previous piece from the menu, or press the button arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection, and click the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection can't be deleted. however, that doesn't matter, since it is not saved when leaving & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer, which are non-General MIDI files. in this case, the MIDI map general-MIDI events translated into events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to Bright Piano in events of type Change patch to Trumpet, making it always a trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have a sound card, you don't need MIDI map because all sound cards GM is compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Sorry, there is no programs to create MIDI maps. therefore, you need to edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favorite bar).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that saves all the requirements for the play of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear so often as desired. a prerequisite for this is that every occurrence had a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "name of keymap..." END Define KEYMAP "A further Keymap... END Define CHANNELMAP... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">They see that Define is needed to view that a section starts (except for options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send your map file as an e-mail, so that I can support in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, the patch of General MIDI is shown on your specific keyboard. the general use will see as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is believed that the GM is in the correct sequence (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all sounds which this instrument need to put on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard is not using a tissue (e.g. with sound 60), you can take a ring (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So, if you want to play an MIDI file a note with patch 127 (fabric surplus), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound in the MIDI file is available.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here, with the term Drum Patch the Patch, there is a different pertusionist instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one that means the sound level of the pitch on the same drum (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to add sounds like sounds on a specific channel or instrument. use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As in the PATCHMAP section, the order of the lines is very important, so the availability. you must create 128 items.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keyboard maps for each channel and every instrument. you have to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are mainly used to skip sounds on the Perkussions-Canal. check out as an example the supplied keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to replace some channels on others. if you want to replace the first and second channel, simply make it simply in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others require channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP Section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is set on the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap does not need to use the name name for this channel. if you are using the ForcePatch Option, all events will ignore all events that try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to use the Perkussions-Patch on the Perkussions-channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for Pitch Benders to be multiplied in which relationship pitch-bender events will be multiplied by the value n, this with the formula n * (r / 4096) is converted and then redirected. the value 4096 is used, so that in the Map file does not stand decimal.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM is presenting a keyboard that is to play a Pitch-Bender event with the value 4096 to play a tone higher. unfortunately, some keyboards are trying to play two tones up to a octave. you'll need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. you can find in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole row of piano (one for each MIDI channel). on these claviatures you will see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view, in order to change the instrument on a specific channel. if you have changed an instrument, the button does not switch to green but red, to view that no longer used the original instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to view the played tones. view the Settings menu under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed-LCD displays the speed, which is played a song. the higher the number, the bigger the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. if you will find such a song be too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how a music piece has to be played. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc. so, the same MIDI file can result in two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can compile up to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs you need a similar sound quality. in a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you also have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">That can happen if you have a binary form (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support, you need to download and install a source distribution (for instance by kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder that you want to add in & conqueror; select all the files, and drag it to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, activate the automatic adjustment to the collection. otherwise, the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can call the arrow button on the left of the Tempo- LCD, to slow down the playback. to restore the standard tempo.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have an & KDE; -Desktop a & conqueror; -window with my MIDI file and & kmid; if I wish to play a karaoke file (if I would like to play a karaoke file), or if I wish to play a file, merely go to the & conqueror; -window switch and select the desired file into the window of & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file just as soon as you want to add them to a collection, turn off the setting up to a collection, and the new; file is added to the temporary collection. open from files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have downloaded the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid., you just want to play the first file. thus, you will set the setting up automatic to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection, then just this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then connect B.mid and C.mid to play and create a collection of all three files. how do you do it?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent MIDI files or postcards. all thank you! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, animate me, continue to program & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; I wrote in the third year, so that I'm not much time to take for my hobbies but I tried to collect MIDI files, music and phrases.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where they can download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you simply want to make me happy, write an e-mail: lara @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really do a huge surprise when you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all who want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file, but you should receive a MIDI file, but you should contact me because I might have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have & kmid; completely written in my free time and rooted by no man's money. I therefore want to program that I can only be programmed, because / if I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, as sound quality depends on your sound card. it's not the same if you use a FM device or a AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card you need to compile & kmid; with the parameters MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it starts as if you could have a sound card, except that you can't listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & KDE; mailing lists or send an error addication directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& kmplayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and FFMpeg. the program is needed to play video files from the MPlayer or phono formats, as well as to play DVD's, VCD or TV and camera.</seg>

<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE website to check new versions, or send the question to The & KDE; user mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. there's the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that is displayed only when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to assemble the preferred connections under the menu bookmarks, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries, you should use the category continuous playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierogestufe. if you get an entry, its group and all its sub-groups are copied to the current Category and playback starts with the attached entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current pieces', television and continuous replaylist can also be changed by direct Editions of XML files. of course, you can only do if & kmplayer; not running through an editor, but also through the application itself. by clicking on a subgroup, only the XML content is displayed only.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you need to be chosen from the menu on the same with playlist and select either the processing mode, or another category can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes lost if the processing mode left or another group will be selected without paying the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Following ease of convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can be switched on only by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation of starting and respondents can be disabled by editing from ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and Change of [General Options] No Intro = 0 observes option to '1'. if the option is not available, it can be simply inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & kmplayer; you will notice the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / val.xml and ~ / kmplayer / excit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation of starting time does not need to be short, it will automatically end through the opening of another source. this would be, however, the user can finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the ads of a favorite photos: & lt; + / / home / Koos: / / / home / Koos; & lt; / bodysuit; & lt; / bodysuit; In list test / several examples of SMIL which are supported by & kmplayer; are supported.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider to the configuration of MPlayer in the configuration dialog box of & kmplayer; here, the path of the MPlayer and the cache size of the data flow from the network and other things can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar toolbar. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition in the configuration dialog box of & kmplayer; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, such as the setup of the backend by mimetype. here is an example like a 'flash' with the module-fuss-Mozilla is played:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & kmplayer; it can even be added to the special field of embed for YouTube in the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Thus the & kmplayer; 'flash' can play in HTML pages, the & kmplayer; module is used as a service provider for the Mime type, / x-Shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file assignment of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The conqueror & kmplayer; is in a consoles application to browse and follow error messages related to the charging of the browser module library. if no error occur, the backend output is within & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">With this always a fixed backend for a particular Mime type is taken (of course only if this was determined), this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play from TV maps, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be configured to used equipment and TV channels, the scanner can be used manually from the configuration dialog box or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (video data recorders) settings in the kmplayer, the dialog box is detected in the settings below - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be selected port where one can be selected (e.g., PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably won a DVB in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support for kmplayer can use only XVideo, it should also work on the first screen (: 0.0). this reason why the video forlinux extension is supported for the X server. therefore, the video forlinux extension has to be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally are used by KMPlayer for the sources of different names. at the time of emergence of this documentation, dvdsource, source, eclipsing, tvring, vcdsource and vrensource. if they are activated, they start playing playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Featudialoges, the & quantaplc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars provide a fast insert of tags in a document without any danger of a writing missing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing as a folder. you contain only the file descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder carry the name of writing language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declare if they are necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible, so many users have a better insight and more information in working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes any element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits will be displayed in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an TagXML document. it can only occur in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains only one element type on itself nothing else.</seg>

<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this promotion, external applications can be started (or parts of the document), which are started (or parts of the document). examples from & quantaplus; even are the quick start dialog or the various see in...

<seg id="2030">The first must be the name of the script and interpreter. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are permitted, it is recommended to use the% scriptile variable in command line: global script file: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts within your path: $Path There are other special variable that can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the URL of the document. in case of a local document file: / from the document's name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; process replaces. if by & quantaplus; only one instance is going to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; from the remote script is used.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above mentioned methods, a script of & quantaplus may be made to the standard input. in the selection box input can be determined, which is to be sent to default.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected section of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally recommended only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the amended application can be redirected. there are two types output: normal output, which is specified on the default output. it can be noted, which is set to the default output document by default:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a toolbar for each group. in any case it is not too many, so you can create a tool bar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add actions to configure and configure your settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">Parts of this window are fairly self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom end of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all necessary fields and add the day to the appropriate tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and if the Attributes has and you are planning to edit the "tag" tag if available, hence an input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is it a bad symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? if we replace difficulties before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">For creating a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & kmenu; graphics further programs (or where else it is in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixel standard, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to realize what the promotion does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I decided to create a starting button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually interpreted as loose, stared, further interpreted), or should at least, a message appears to be signalled, or should be ready to start reading this symbol; starting a day in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it has to be connected to the action. this is done by the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. in addition to the text field there is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue with other tags, so it's still available, or confirm with the OK button.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantaplus; -functions to the tool bar, or it should make it possible to set up the toolbar in several groups. make sure the tool bar can be selected via settings. make sure that the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (very left) for my tool bar. after selecting the element, which is to be added to the tool bar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the element to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to preview an easy way to access the conqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, as the separators support the grouping. someone, who doesn't know my tool bar, could believe that the & conqueror is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by means of all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the correct folder. after reeXML does not exist, but your tool bar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust their & descriptionrc; so that your tool bar (s) is charged if a file is opened from the respective type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Maybe the most remarkable expansion of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the formatting language that you are on love. this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; document-tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -repository check whether someone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for formatting / script / etc; -language you need to create the docrc file. let's first allow you to treat the second part.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc to you = path, relative to this file, e.g. php42 / # elements selected in the main index Top Element = # Sec2.1, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2.</seg>
<seg id="2061">The visible section is defined by the visible section of documentation in the document-tree. for example, see in the & PHP; documentation so:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE config File [Tree] Doc you = php42 / # top level Elements Top Element = PHP 4.2 Documentation = Table of contents, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = Basic syntax,...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this shows that it is about sub-folders in the tree with its own content. there is no known border for the chess technique (except for reason) mdash; but try it out.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You notice that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consistent in the upper end of the building management & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing but pay attention & B; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resourcendat.Be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file which is used for creating a & PHP; script file for the mysql _ fetch _ array _ function is to be displayed. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (Context List) and the file sharing links.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc save as well as $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (so you have to do this in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that this well and value are shared, you will send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation were used to the & quantaplus; -repository. you will not be rich, but proud to be proud to work with the best web-development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to divide the resources (DTEP packages, tool bar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or otherwise to whom are sent by email, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email messages, in context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archives, from where all the other & quantaplus; -User may be checked and used only if our team needs them as accurate and useful for the publication. to deal with a full-use contribution to which it guarantees a GPG / PGP key. thus, the source of resources is ensured, both for our team and later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading you will be asked for their private GPG key (the Passphrase is not stored), or in the case you have to request several keys. in the dialog New resource you need to remain empty (URL preview can stay empty) and then click OK to upload the upload of OK.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can also instantly upload the menu DTD DTD package (DTEP), and in the context menu of files and folders on the templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, yet in front of the installation, & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by testing of integrity and Signihilation. if the integrity is given, and the resource is carefully signed, a message appears with the indication of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML-languages that is currently not yet supported by & quantaplus; but the creation can be time consuming, because hundreds of day files can be needed in the tagXML format. there is the simpler way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started by the DTD shop and Converting a DTD. choose the .dtd file with the DTD description, which should be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target record: the newly created & DTEP; is written in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitions: the string, die im! doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / dee.dtd should appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, & quantaplus; after conversion of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. in order to understand these to understand and full benefit from & quantaplus; we must first make these concepts about these concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus; little use brils.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the work area is divided into three areas: global, locally and projects. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for each, the & quantaplus; uses, available. of tool affecting transactions is stored, in the joint Ordingement of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators different tool bar, actions and samples in a global tree that will then be available in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements provide a personal collection of web-developers for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; designs up to tool bars with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project. simply said, this is the most restricted size. all the elements are stored in the folder's folder and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editorial window, building views, the boxes with information and toolbars. please beat in, and for further information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the antitreiter with the right mouse button, to get a context menu with the current document appropriate entries, as close to the current, other or any antitreiter, new, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to present the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click on the editorial area lead to another context menu regarding the processed document, such as basic processing steps (cut / copy / insert), editing the mouse under the mouse, or opening the file if the string is under the mouse hand a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editorial master, the monitor sets of the monitor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional will be shown as standard, for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further development of & quantaplus, the tool bar will be adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bar is really easy. if they want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; in their document then click on the tag that same day. if you wish to insert the data for this straight day. if you wish to add multiple attributes (as anchor), you can insert several attributes (as anchor).</seg>
<seg id="2091">The installation views (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information about & quantaplus; to navigate them to open and pierce. in the representation of boxes, project, patterns, documentary structure, scripts, attributes and documentation construction devices are available.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all the files in the project and allows the administrator of the files in the project by right mouse click. actions like adding, removing, uploading or delete files from the storage medium can be performed using the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all options open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates only available for the respective user and templates in projects are only available in the project. more on templates is available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available script. the concept of integration in Global, Lokal and Project can also be downloaded here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the information available via the right mouse button. on the right mouse button, you can start the script, edit or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking with the links of an element name, the cursor will open on the position of the element. by right-click of a Elementes, a list of commands will open in terms of navigation and collection of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among other buildings. with it, you can change Attributes and namespaces. this is able to change the contents of all available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for the web technology for your development. it may be downloaded documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'document site can be downloaded, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited and looked at project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two cartons at the bottom end of the window can be reached via the useful information: the message window and the problem windows.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This cartridge shows information about each in Quanta clamps. such as the DTD used the current document and all modifications to DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This cardboard box shows all the errors inside the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (so that gives) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will show the corresponding command. the chocolates of tool bar is the possibility to define his own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another feature of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with eMail. & quantaplus; sends the tool bar as compressed Tar-Archive by & mail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can secure this in & quantaplus; as any other guarantee and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of & quantaplus; files on your system. for this, autoconf has a number of options to get to the custom script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and here are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems at starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path includes the & KDE; 3 bin folders. also, you should make sure that is no older version of & KDE; 3 in the Path from her bin folders. the same is for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; was optimized for a rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While the effort to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus, began to deal with a close-up idea; what would be, if & quantaplus; an independent, extended markup language editor would be? well, this would be the absolutely great web development tool for & KDE; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; is & quantaplus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. together, if you can define it & XML; then it should be & quantaplus; it should be & quantaplus; it will be the suitable & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the aforementioned claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product on the outstanding efforts of the entire & KDE; report is not only possible to expand things, but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; as to expand, as they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web-developers to improve the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can extend the productivity almost every task. by using the program KomsomersA & quantaplus; extend, without any script you can notice to understand a script (more about it in.)</seg>

<seg id="2122">Shows the message window, or not. that's the window where you can see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">The problem and inscriptions on the lower edge of the & quantaplus; main window is activated once you changes to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Shows the toolbar to the left from the main window. this column allows you to specify a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu together with entries foremost or Next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">A existential project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; -projects are stored by extension .webcamj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searched the project directory to new files that could be there. this enables you to copy graphic files into your project folder or folders and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & KDE; and if you have downloaded more inputs / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings like & quantaplus; the project manages. in chapter & quantaplus; -projects you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Invites you to create a project tool bar. they are kept in project you / toolbars, and are only in this menu if you have assigned them this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your tool bar. allows you to select the type of tool bar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. that created only the name. promotions must be saved by Settings... add tool bar codes or you are asked to save the tool bar, whether you want to save the tool bar.</seg>

<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the mouse button, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project, developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; support development in financial form, please find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed in the top of the project, e.g. after filling the project called the entire directory structure for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift; F7 project project features.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is automatically filled.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; the project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webcamj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can connect the server address of the machine to which you want to access the local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If one can be empty this field, the default settings of the chosen protocol are used. depending on the remote computer, it could be a customization.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and standard templates. if a common collection of files can be used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standards.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the tool bar can be stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files for different projects is used, this folder should be set instead of the standards.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from local file system into the project. several files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great when you have static web content that you want to download and change. at serverance scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you need to proceed differently.</seg>

<seg id="2183">The password will keep in the core memory and forget it. this possibility is useful if you need to upload files to files and save the rather unsafe password on the disk. option is not listed in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">That will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high lavers are created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to various servers. during editing or creation of a profile, this dialog will appear:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to be copied to files. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the uploading. the list depends on the version of & KDE; and the installed Kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally, this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator operates a service not on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your attack shaft this is either a timesaving function or a risk. if the password will be stored on the plate, so it can't be read easily, but everyone can see with programming language.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and tools. it can be loaded in a project many views, that means that you can load different files and tool bars, and replace the currently unopened files and machine tools.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened in the menu or the Project tool bar, accessible via settings tool bar toolbar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to your own workpiece.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, tool bar in & quantaplus; best over the menu tool bar can be stacked. using and add tool bar will be treated below in the section adding tool bars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The tool bar and symbols may be set either by means of context menu (right click on the tool bar), in which the new toolbar can be set, which can be set in the dialog, where can be specified where actions can be visible on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a tool bar, additionally the entries will remove the entries and action that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The tool bar and the actions of them can set up in the menu with settings... and set adjustments to set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are used in key documentaries, code-escalel and files to link. & quantaplus; used templates, as a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, shift or any of the system existing directory within the front-tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you can imagine to the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions on the beginning of every template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can be added any file except text, so images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are normally added in documents using shortcuts (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / url). some examples will be available in the template-tree under global templates. additional information on templates tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually, a simple report for the purpose and organises the work in an appropriate way to be efficiently. some examples may be found in the coverage of global templates. see for more information on templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted on a template but the same text area should always be inserted into documents. you can find everything from a comment via a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. some examples are available in the ballroom under global templates. see for more information on templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says that this templates serve for whole websites as templates. they are a collection of different documents that can be arranged in a folder tincture, in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document's structure to Belieben (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select file as template save as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as the result is, note that (even if it was stored as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. check out in the repository under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">In your document, select text in your document and save as template as template. alternatively, you can store your selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be pulled with pulling on the template templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only copy in a copy folder. all file management functions can be used, such as pulling and insert or insert on the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can create and create a name in the file format or in the project files, select a name for the template and secure. by default, the project folder is secured, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very targeted way-oriented approach. you can create headlines and footlines, or dynamically with & PHP; create files insert or linked with them. additionally, you can keep some things when using templates in projects very deep in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow template is based on the files in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as shown above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">In order to define the behaviour of a folder, click the folder with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties menu on the folder. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blown off, as soon as usual attributes.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except for the stem folders, except they would be explicitly enabled, except they would be explicitly enabled. in case of normal folder it would be explicitly enabled, in case of a normal folder it appears, probably in a family folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows for printed or printed text for templates within this folder. this could be general headlines or foot lines for a specific project and allows copying files into a folder with special headlines / footlines a whole presentation already with the matching headlines / footlines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, in addition to context menu (show the right mouse button) you have a full command collection for adding folders or copy and add templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & Source Editor, which are accessible via the menu View. the first mode replaces the source code by VPL; Editor and 2nd share the editorial window in two parts: the source editor and the VPL; Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; Editor works as follows: it invites you to edit a document as a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and be saved in the source code editor, which are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor at a document which contains & PHP; contains a small green symbol of the Vohandrestation & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with VPL; Editor is not possible to edit it directly with VPL; there is no plans to change these behaviors.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly as the first, except that at the same time, the cursor is displayed in the source editor and in VPL; Editor is both active and the cursor is active in the source code and in VPL; this mode is already active but transferred the cursor of the active cursor from a window to others, whereby the position will be retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between VPL; Editor and the source editor can be adjusted via Settings... According to choosing VPL; view you can automatically choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in the selection, the recommendation can be set automatically. in principle, the recommendation is automatically set to slow calculator and a large pot for slow computer.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphic tools for the same. why so & crdiff3;? let me explain shortly, why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributions had been revised and simultaneously corrected in many places. another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts in bringing together.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me showed me only the modified lines, but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines. and there was no hints referring to the places where perhaps only the feeding had changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & crdiff3; was able to display differences in row and changes to white characters. later, any quantity of more useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, copy it into the clipboard and add it in one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the same and merging of folders. this function turned & crdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way cohort is fully supported. this is useful when two persons can work independently of one piece code and changes. the original file (the base) helps to process the dissolution of conflicts. in this editor, you can even edit the result. the screenshot shows three quell files in combination:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& diff3; assists you also in the same and merging complete folder. this screen photo shows & crdiff3; the folder will lead:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& diff3; shows the exact differences and is similar to the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often have to check Kode, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed visible. if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no trouble does not change the influence.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates that the file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can use the tilt-work by using only the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diffuse 3 Ordinary 2 folder, folder 2 folder, diffuse, folder 3 folder, folder 3 folder, folder 3 folder.</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows manual repair of filenames, the selection via the file browser (file...) or select a last open file from the list. opening dialog box, you don't need to specify the third file; if you are empty the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences are performed with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Over the knob folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the same or merging of folders will be selected, for B and C, however, is a folder, then uses & diffuse 3; the filenames from A into the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is crossed, the input field is active and can be used. however, it is not necessarily necessary to define an output file. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set button opens up a dialog with settings. here you can set options before you start with the same / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & crdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparative window. compared with, you can not select files, you can simply beat the dialog with the reset button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and store: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall over a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What thought is behind? sometimes it contains a file such as several similar functions. if you want to find out what these features are, you would like to download them in & diff3; download and compare it. now you can easily compare the relevant sections, then add them and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at the moment you can find nothing out of & diff3; only the case can be supported by text in a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and put text into another program as a cut and insert (instead of copying and insert). in such case, your original data could perish.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each Text window is the info-line. the info-line contains the characters A, B or C, the filenames and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (please note that the mouse has a file for long, let the mouse rest a while on the line. then a small assistance window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source code are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these settings can be changed over the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, you can see in the color which file differs. if both files are different, the default color is particularly useful when you compare three files. that is good in the next section (merging) good.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left next to the text is the summarize column. if differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see the relevant changes only in character strings and comments, for the preprocessing unit and in few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the abstracts of the text, is interrupted in the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line shift is activated, the line is indicated in broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparative windows) also has a info-line with the inscription:, the filename and [encoder] if you have processed the result. usually, it contains the automatic merging already text, but often also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! to all conflicts has been dissolved, the store is deactivated!!! (use the buttons Springe to next dissolved / unsolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative windows are used, each difference is to be replaced by a conflict at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group will be displayed in all windows and the first row of the group will be displayed, where the current group is otherwise visible.) This group will then be highlighted by color background colour and on the left hand a black beams.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, by automatic merging or by manual edit, no further line remains in the group; then, in these lines of text & lt; there is only one placeholder for the case that you may change your opinion, and maybe again a different source. this text appears neither in the final saved file, nor in a marking which you may copy and then add differently.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text reads; it appears in the clipboard; however, in the clipboard, if you copy such a text from the result window, go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if you select the options listed below or Ignoriere C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This will navigate with the image afford and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are in one of the window, you can use the arrow keys on the right, end, Ctrl-Start and Ctrl-end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs. the overload column can also be used by clicking on navigation.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other keys to edit. with the insert button you can switch between insert and transfer mode. (preset is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summarizing columns syncs the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective Group (as already defined in paragraph and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference (Ctrl-picture downward) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture downward) or to the next / previous conflict. therefore, all non-dissolved conflicts has to be seen as a conflict. therefore, between dissolved and unsolved conflict must be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">In order to copy the marking into the clipboard, you need to copy the copying button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl insert). if this option is enabled, automatically copying them into the clipboard and carefully copy the manual copying. be careful with this option, because you could see the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilenings are stored according to the underlying operating system. UNIX variants use a line pre-rack\\ r\. KDiff3 retains the line-up of the source files, therefore you should use & diff3; also not with binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the last used files will be saved automatically and re-produced during the next start. (menu entry &gt; KDiff3 setup)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a script with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog provides fonts with variable width to choose from, you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences in recursive lettering are represented. if the chosen Scriptures cannot be supported, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in its pure form, but would be rendered straight. on these systems, the button preferences automatically introduces an unjust colour.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, when pressing the tab button, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted. otherwise, an tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you input or return, the incoming line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, your selection will be automatically copied to clipboard. manual copying into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer to store. the default value is the most common selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In the same way files tries & crdiff3; first, all fully identical lines will be ignored. during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step is not ignored. in this step white characters are not ignored. even in combination, white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a car folder '\\' and a line-up '\' at the end of a line, but then could not save files with different sizes in side-side-side comparison, but like a white character. during merging, this option must be disabled. in default this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result the differences are nevertheless displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The default setting is disabled in the default. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensely after even smaller differences. the option is activated in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly at very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the automatic start-up mode, this setting, as long as the result of the selection will be displayed, before the next unsolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically detects all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as a source. (default it is useful if white characters occur in many files. if you have only access the functions of elects A / B / C for all unloaded white conflicts, if the options are ignored or Ignoriere C / C + + comments are activated.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are given in the chapter on scanning of folders and implementing a merge operation. look for details under documentation to the directory comparison and merge tracking.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored, and an older version exists, then the original version is the Suffix .original file, if already a backup file with the Suffix .original exists, it will be deleted without a further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapts to the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current program. you have to finish and reboot, so that the change is active. (this option is not available in the KDE version by & crdiff3; not available because the language is set global over the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you use this option, it is used for all entries the top setting.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for the coding is a short notice of what the local coding is. (this can not be changed here and has some informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file coding for source files. this influences how special characters can be handled and interpreting. as the coding for each file can be individually adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can define which encoding is to be used.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, you might not work with your codec. (for example, your files can be 16-bit Unicode, but the command command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can define the coding of the output command properties.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch on this to suppress the change of changes in white characters in the text or oversight. (note: this applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ignoriere C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is available only if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences in a coloured coded overload column are displayed. however, you might want to see only the differences between two of three files; -s; B, A & B; -gt; C or B & B; -C is displayed in addition to the normal still a second overload column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply put the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">It provides the comparison between each other or another. this may also be useful for ads of long lines. (this option is in the window menu).</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and decide to compose the files in the merge menu, even if you use only two files. a simple click starts to restart the file name as preset name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first pass on this external command. in & diff3; it will then write the output of the command, and not the file itself. you can write your own label, which is exactly according to your requirements. for example, they can use this function, or for correct parts.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will first pass on this external command. if also a normal pre-processing command was given (see above), the issue of the command is just used. you can write your own label, which corresponds to exactly your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind that user is more flexibility when adjusting the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users want to program itself. however, the good news is that in most cases SED or Perl are completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for entry into large letters: SED'B /\\ (. *\\) /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other versioning systems use some key words to insert character strings (info: / cvs / Keyword Substitution). all follow the same pattern $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with SED, you may need to understand it and perhaps do you like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignores of numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiffusion. but it is good as an example of a further pre-processing command for line spacing. SED's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a suitable matches, and any hits will be replaced by nothing, so it's deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several conditions at one time. then, you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the propositions. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of SED you can also use something like Perl. Perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switches' allerdings are needed with Perl. where SED\\ (and\\) are needed (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">Data after the normal preprocessing unit will retain for display and merge. further operations change only the data that sees the line tripoisthmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you use a normal pre-processing unit, the line equates equates the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or differences, you can't notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often you have to edit programmers in a folder many files. for this reason you can compare and assemble complete folder.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... make a suggestion for each object; you can adjust the suggestion before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate and simulate the simulated changes, without it really do it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... executes selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the same and merging of individual files. you have to specify only folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a basis. if no target folder was specified, uses & diffuse 3; folder 3 as target folders.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will not start to carry the merge operation, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details follow)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During the reading of the folder you will be informed a small news window over the current progress. if you cancel the folder, only the files listed, which were compared to the time.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is completed, shows & crdiff3; a list of listing with results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and any folder of the scan found during the scan, will be displayed in a tree here. you can select an object with a single mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded, by clicking on the + / - click on the + / - click on the folder / right. the directory menu contains two features All subdirectories can be folded and all subdirectories can be folded to which you can unfold or replace them.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double click on a file, the file is restarted and it appears a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object. in such a case, the cohort-action can be set automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, the colors are red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folder will be regarded as identical if the whole content is identical. then, folders also have the same color. at folders, the age is unconsiderable for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. colors are reflected the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow becomes red and later when it is old, red will be red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B identical but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C identical but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C not have the same file type (e.g. if A folder and B is a file): error: contradictory data types. as long as such error objects exist, cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B does not have the same file type (e.g. if A folder and B is a file): error: contradictory data types. as long as such error objects exist, cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronize is active, if only two folders and no explicitly specified target folder, and if the option directories are synchronized. then chooses & diff3; the necessary action is identical, so that both folders are identical. if you have an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: assemble and save the result into both folders. (the user looks as a visible filename for the output file only B; directly after merging copies & crdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders will be compiled and select the new file instead of merge operation (unsafe), but the same date appears, but the same date appears, but the date is identical.. solo such errors can not be started, the merge can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging a file is working after the other. you show status column, if the merge was successful, and according to other messages, if something unwanted is completed, you should take a final review and see whether the status is everywhere in order.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in setup dialog, the file-comparative method is selected, Kdiff3 will display further columns. these contain the number of unmonasteries, dissolved, not white and white conflicts. (the column for soldered conflicts is displayed only when three folders can be compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can connect either to the selected entry (file or Odner) or any entries once. if you have selected all interchr actions (even in all subfolders), you can launch the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no destination folder, then, in three-folder compile mode, C is used as destination where two-folder merging will be chosen as the goal and used to synchronize A and / or B as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you select a destination folder, please check whether all entries must be in the target folder, also in the folder name, there are some options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To assemble all entries: choose directories / continue in the menu menu or press F7 (the key pendant). in order to assemble the current entry, select the action of the current element or press the F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If the contradictory data types still exists, a message appears to occur on the faulty elements. you can select a valid promotion for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you want to assemble all entries, a dialog window appears with the options execute, simulate and break.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you would like to see what would happen without the really changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& diff3; then executes certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is necessary (merge of a single file), then a merging window (please note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select / continue or press F7. if you don't have saved others, an appropriate dialog appears. then leads & crdiff3; his work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & crdiff3; on an error occurred, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you can try to try the cause of the problem. if you have the opportunity to try to select the cause of the problem, or to solve the problem of the problem before you proceed with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were compiled individually, all entries (in the current session) and lead them together in later. even if the merge result was not stored or not saved, these entries will be done as done. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & Cool3; (menu settings - &gt; KDiffusion...) now has a section called directory interferences with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that are set on the indicated design are displayed in the element-tree. separate patterns with a semicolon;. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default value is *. folder must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignore files that are also ignored by CVS. many autonomous files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder can be set with a .cvsignal file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a default file attribute. in other file systems it marks a leading score. this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">For links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic checks are compared. if the option is switched on, the files are compared to which the links show. this is deactivated by default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared, if the option is switched on. if the option is switched on, the links like normal folders will lead and recursively searched it. (notice that this option would lead to a final grinder and crashes 3;) This option is shut down in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">A complete analysis of any file through and shows the statistics of columns. (the number of dissolved, unmonasteries, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than an easy binary analysis, and much slower, if they are applied to files that contain no text. (enter an essential anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large files through a slow network, it may be faster, just the notice date and the file size you will need a certain level of safety. please use caution. this option is activated in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidentiality date. there will be no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal to. that can be useful when copying the date of change. please be careful with caution. this option is activated in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronize mode when two folders, and no target folder was specified. in this mode, the proposals will be identical, so that both folders are identical. also the results are stored in both folders. this option is shut off in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copy of the newer file is being proposed as an action. (this will be considered insecure, because the other file is not changed too. you should check this option in any case.) This option is shut off.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or file is replaced by another or deleted file, the original version is renamed and get the extension .original. if an old backup file is released with .original expansion already exists, this is not only the merging of individual files, not just the whole folder. this option is switched on.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folders-merge results are visible to the merging of individual files; you can turn the window part with the mouse. if you don't want to switch the window windows in the window menu and switch between directory and text windows between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file just using double click. nevertheless, there is a single file directly together, without the folder you need to merge without the merge command. once you can save the folder, the status will run together and the file will not merge again when you merge the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is lost, however, if you read the directory again: directory menu: reread</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line is compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax for local files and folders. a few things you should note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively undant. or.. included. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masking. (# - &gt;% 23, idle - &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. there is a brief list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then there is always a file accepted as link target. (FTP:, ftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permission or change of change. therefore, the authorization or change of change is from the original. (please note the option of confidence of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of the main purpose is currently the differences in KDevelop. KDevelop starts always the built-in differences in KDevelop. in order to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button on the Differences and then choose In Kdiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally you need & crdiff3; two full input files. if it is used as a KPart, it takes & crdiff3; the name of the original files from a patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then starts & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the conqueror you can select a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that the original file does not work if you have changed the original files since generation of a patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; as Part 2, it supports only the same of two files, a very small tool bar and menu. the merge or the same folder is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now Heist there are available). Moreover, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can compile as the program diffuse 3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL programs already very long and I have learned a lot in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all the programmers running this way or to go to him.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You probably have compiled the program from the sources and it should not be notified to KDE. in default, KDE will not find resources for user interfaces (e.g., diffuse 3ui.rc). in the README file you can find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines will be identical as identical; however, if only a non-white characters is different, the line is not treated as the same. if, the next lines the next to Each Comis costly but this is the case of the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor is noted for any difference in the files where he begins and where he ends. this important information is simply lost, if the result is simply stored as text file, and it is too much effort to create extra an own file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort has been too large. you can always recover a specific version always by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to process larger amounts of text, an other editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After the remove from text is suddenly lit; no src linens; appeared and the text can't be erased. what does that mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& diff3; uses many colors for creating differences. even more approach would be confused and missing the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and errors came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">In order to use all functions of & diff3; you need & KDE; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the last changes will be found under http: / / diff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & crdiff3; compile and install on a system with & KDE; use the following command in the basic folder of the & crdiff3; -distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives the folder in your system, where KDE is installed. if you are unsafe, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & diffuse 3; autoconf and automake, you should not have any problems when compile. should you need difficulties, report on the & KDE; mailinglist of them.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift removing) copies into the clipboard and delete the selected text. insert the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position and replaced the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to re-read the folder with the function on update.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries are displayed, the differences are indicated that identical files are not included in the target folder. if the target folder does not contain these files, they are missing after the merge. (the behaviour is probably changed in a later program version.) This option is shut off.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines are attached to the end of the selected group to the end of the selected group (if they are not already available). if the lines are already present, they will be removed by clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In the default this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (e.g. 'A' and 'a') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpens; shows a miniature show of all virtual work areas. it is quite practical to change the current programs on the desktop to stop her size, or to move them. this works both within a single work area as well as in several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpens; can view all virtual work areas as well as in the ongoing applications. applications can be selected and even moves to work area and to other applications.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the central mouse button, window can be moved within & kpens; the movement is possible both within a working area and also on other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on which the right mouse button is clicked on: if on the empty background of & kpager; however, the context menu has only clicked on an application within & kpager; however, the text and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize, maximize, on working area and end. the command will act the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window onto the full size of the desktop. appears only if on an application it was clicked.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Send the application to the selected virtual desktop. appears only if it was clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is marked, you can move windows inside the & kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to be moved to other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, in & kpens, the names of virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field leaves the & kpager; view the numbers of virtual desktops. it can be crossed along with name, the name is provided with ordinator, & eg; 1st floor area.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background will also be displayed as a background in the background.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is crossed, the current programs are displayed as small windows in & kpens; otherwise, the empty space will be shown to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here, the view of the program window will be selected. simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon displays the windows with its standard symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & kpens; main window can be determined: classic leaves & kpens; in some other window managers; in some other window managers, horizontally shows all virtual desktops in a horizontal position, especially well suited for the presentation at the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager Miniature in the Control Panel. it has the advantage that it can change in size as symbols or with their content and move it out outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right button of mouse within & kpager; and subsequent fitting of switch switches can set the dialog settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment, this is not changed in the dialog settings. you can do this manually in dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor like e.g. & kedit; or VI. if you have no write permission for the file, you have to register to your system administrator. in this file you have to pay the key windowTransparentMode 1 and to this a value. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly updated by new functions. it is optimised for use on more powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">If you like & kmag, a window appears as above. the main window of the screen. in the following will be displayed as a magnifying window. the image, which is displayed in the magnifying window, is an enlarged range of screen and is described in the following as a selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting increases & kmag; the area around the mouse will display like a mobile magnifying. alternatively, you can set a selected screen area in the magnifying window (selection window) or the surroundings of the mouse button at the screen level (eg; on the left screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid the mouse in the enlarged window, select the mouse click. please note, the & kmag; currently not able to recognize the form of the mouse. this is always the standard KDE; / Qt; mouse hand.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection window, you can adjust the select window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and buttons. this can be done in the following ways:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button, so you can capture the contents of the magnifying edge. this goes also with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally push the & Shift; button or remove the & MMB; you can move the drop-down window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination, you can change the size of the select window. note that the upper left corner of the drop point is fixed and only move the lower right corner.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& kmag; owns a lot of functions. you can copy the enlarged image directly to the printer to insert into the clipboard (to insert it later in other applications), the image film and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starts or stop the update of the display. the stops of the update causes that the required CPU time is 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, Hoch, Very high). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a select window will be displayed. the selected area will be displayed in one window.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click on the same spot. it is thought to help people who emulate a mouse click pain. Moreover, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. however, this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can cause the pain to use the mouse, and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you can consult a physician because using your computer, you should consult a physician if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">In order to declare it once: even if & kmousetool; pain helps prevent the mouse with the mouse, it is against pain which is caused by reason of mouse, useless. and as with all ergonomic support, the result can be impacted at any time.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitor your mouse moving and performs a mouse click, as soon as you break the movement short.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart shift is activated, make & kmousetool; a break, after pressing the mouse button, move it until the end of the mouse is run. this way you can run the pulling in the mouse button. the smart shift requires a little practice, but you get rid of it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This temporary time has to hide after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If it is enabled, it is enabled, the rotation speed will be set (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after shutdown the mouse button, if the mouse is left again, if there is no evidence due to the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; is this function activated by clicking on the right and back, followed by a break, one click with the right mouse button. this moves will be saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool; the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can move & KDE; along with it, you can move the reaction time. open the & kcontrolcenter, go there sound & multimedia, select the sound system and here the rider General. there is a slider sound buffers to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, will start & kmousetool; at every start of & KDE. this feature is currently only under & KDE; available at GNOME or other window environments please contact the relevant documentation to the rate, as you will start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets all the settings on the values given when opening the dialogue. you have already pressed the button on the user after the last pressing of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best, use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the smart shift should first be disabled, you can then click on the automatic mouse, you can later push the smart shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response time of & KDE; for sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First you should make aware of which places a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that doesn't display no link, you can use the mouse on such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse is unlock, you should clean your mouse. that's usually pretty easy. the trick is clean that you don't just clean the mouse, but also the rolls that get in touch with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you must remove the mouse ball. as this happens, is from mouse to mouse. but it should be clear when you view the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are in the sides of the Loches, into which the ball was inserted. the trick and the pollution can scratch easily with a flat blade or shinging gel.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system performs the design of & kmousetool; if you have just started the shift in this case, meaning that & kmousetool does not end the operation anymore due to the letting of the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use below another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem exists, that you can even run a mouse click. in this way, the status of & kmousetool will be reset, and you can work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and continue the cursor at another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor up to place where you want to make it. so, if you don't want to bring the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you need a mouse button. safe zones for the mouse hand & eg; the grey faces around the tool bar and the cover lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent shift, but I don't create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart shift is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it needs its time before you can move it into the clipboard, and to bring it to any other action, in which you want to move the mouse with the pressing mouse button. but there will probably be a few advice. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use smart decks if you just start to start & kmousetool; click on a mouse click on a right click and keep the Shift key, while you move the mouse button at the other end of the text and reactive there again the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">You can use the audible mouse click. therefore, if & kmousetool; the mouse button pressed a sound like a mouse click. so you can use the smart shift also without the audible mouse click. however, it needs some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the XTest extension for & X Window; it should be installed in most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and a loudspeaker system and are set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; operated the mouse button as soon as the mouse hand harmed. this program has been developed for people suffering from the RSI syndrome, and to which the firm of the Maule pain is prepared.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to be configured for a certain time, that a pulling process begins, before the mouse is left. in this way, the mouse can also be carried out and put off with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for the voice of voices, speaking speed, the noise of the voice and the pitch. Moreover, SSML is part of VoiceXML specification, another W3C specification.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently, & ktops; SSML can only be part and only in the basic functions. the following limitations are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the Rab _ diphone voice (British male), as this is the default vote, which is used for the issue of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or audio system in the Festival configuration dialog does not set to 100nbsp;% is usually spoken, SSML text is usually spoken very monoton.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and proposition identification filters (SDB filters). therefore, you can start & retrieve the whole proposition, as only the first movement has to be pre-read or restoring, and when the voice synthesizer is not directly supported.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the propositional boundary filter. at the first start of & ktops; it is automatically set up as a proposition for a propositional boundary filter. you can add the change or further movement of demarcation filters, but they will be disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="2729">On the easiest way, you learn how to check out the intercom selection and select text to advance. check out the card selection, change some features and check how to select the selection of the microphone. for this purpose you have to have set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is uneffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then, faster with the pre-read, since only the first movement must be processed, and not the whole text block, which can last very long.</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can retrieve text orders on the card orders or can be cancelled, even if the voice synthesizer doesn't support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal proposition can be set automatically when you start ttsmgr the first time. it cannot be switched off, only be removed. do not change anything about this filter, unless you know what you do.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set-up filters get text with a regular expression of propositional sign and add a Tabulatormark (Decimal code 8) to the propositional limits (tabular code will automatically be removed from the text). note that the standard set-generation filters will retain the character encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & KDE; -messages (knurfy), warnings, messages or the output of Screen Readern.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal movement characteristic filter, you can return this again by unloading the file standard _ sbdrc.</seg>
<seg id="2736">Referring to the map Interphone selection you can write the microphone settings for the application. the ticket card is displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top on the map) speaker. with other words: no speaking properties will be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the passest microphone station, which shows all the features of the speaker. if you choose the settings of the speaker, select & ktops; this speaker from. otherwise chooses & ktops; the speaker from which originally introduced the originally introduced properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method for entering the desired microphone properties by clicking on the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the characteristics of the desired string. if this property doesn't play a role, don't matter.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box when the property precedence should have any other features. you can also put several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor when the output is described, this property is rarely treated as a priority property. you may know this property is rare if you possibly know the attribute language, if you may know that a specific application is dispatched in another language as being introduced in the work environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">In order to use all the properties in the field, which corresponds to the following below, click on the selection button and then use speaker, which corresponds to the following below.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 stands for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without a order number is the input 0 required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes immediately when it is started. I compiled Debug support, but I don't get back tracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and Arctic; it's finished yet. probably you need to register GStreamer 0.8.x is the command gst-register-0.8. if the problem is not solved, it is possibly a compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to upgrade or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>

<seg id="2751">On the carteicard audio there is an setting speed. so this works, the SOX program has to be installed and provide for the ambient variable Path. some synthesizers such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed. depending on the chosen voice, this active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speaking speed are ignored when & ktops; & HTML; reads that the HTML is converted to SSML. (see) or if you are completely courageous, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -according to SSML-Performerfilter, and set up the microphone speed.</seg>

<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows users to manage a series of system and desktop settings over a uniform, integrated surface. the & controlcenter; can be called by selecting from K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knuworkconf; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & controletworkconf; create a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in & kcontrolcenter; displayed. the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting the controlcenter; Internet & network network settings in & kmenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It's important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware can not install. physical devices and their drivers need to be operational and configured to configure & craetworkconf; the device performs at all and setting the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">Most of the cases are drivers for the network hardware and other devices to install & Linux; installed and installed. network devices later added, the drivers need to be charged with the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module network settings will be loaded when the network settings in the & controlcenter; index Index is selected. when starting the module network you try to detect the platform automatically on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the platform is offered from the list where the distribution and the release of non-polls can be adjusted permanently. by marking the network settings, this selection can be set automatically. at the next start of the network settings, this selection will automatically be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">The change of network settings are possible only in the system management mode. previously, all options can be displayed, which means settings can be viewed only. in the system management mode you will proceed by clicking the button management mode at the right bottom of the module. it is the input of the password required.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode the total functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The rider network interfaces can be used to manage network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be carried out:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and pressing the button interface... in a dialogue device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are only available. Click on the button on the dialog with further possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection of Automatically the TCP / IP settings of a DHCP Server or BOOTP server will be carried out with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server will be selected for the system simultaneously. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection Manuell can be made TCP / IP configuration without DHCP or BOOTP. in the input field IP address, the required TCP / IP address is required. in the input field network mask, the subnet mask is set.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is marked, the system initialized the network interface during booting. if the initialization is not necessary, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values specified in this dialog will be displayed as the properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address is not already used in the network. entering a TCP / IP conflict with ping in the & console; you can determine whether the desired address is already in use. in the doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off. switching of an enhanced network device is enabled by selecting from the list and pressing the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off. switch off of an activated network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Sets the IP address of the host in local subnet that the physical connection is mediated to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnetworks.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If the computer is more than a network interface, the interface must be selected to the net where the Gateway computer is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A machine with DNS support replaces the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computer only requires IP addresses. if the calculator http is required, it replaces the IP address such as IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator to the name resolution part of the riding name can be added to a simple administration of this list. entries can be added or altered by selecting a paper read or downgrading or downgradation in the list with buttons or down in the priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button to add... from the group calculator to the name resolution can be added to the DNS server. it will add the New Nameserver dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button to add. the entry is then inserted in the list.</seg>

<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & KDE and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it is simply downloading the rpm package and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphical surface can be used as a package or the installation tool of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & KDE is sufficient; but in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only experienced users recommended. however, it is not difficult to compile & craetworkconf; compiled the following commands should afford.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic network technology is given, in the second all by & knuworkconf; changing configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace any further information about IP networks. in this appendix, basic information on the integration of the PC is mediated in a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found great spread. this description is currently concentrating on the common IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to assign the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, am & eg; workplace is the network configuration, that can be used, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address can't be simply chosen!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When installing a own small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen from a specially designed for this purpose, to avoid IP address flicker with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not redirected in the Internet, therefore its any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all computers are included in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = the own computer). the default route is needed for the IP-forward line.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine. normally the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, which works as a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files that are affected by & knuworkconf; are affected and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>

<seg id="2897">Everything went smooth, changing the symbol for tape work, to view that the band is bound. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the content of the band can now be searched for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before the toss of the banana, initially, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to apply this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& dat; is by changing the symbol for the tape, that the binding for the band has solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be cast out without any risk.</seg>

<seg id="2902">After entering the band named and the capacity drives & dat; with the formatting of the band. all data on the tape are lost, the band is automatically bound and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you use the backup process, you must select the necessary files. this can happen to three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in a local file tree. it is only backed up to this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a security profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to create the band indexing file using the band content. this process is erase all existing index files for this band. you can create the index to two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This is a backup profile with the just selected files and the default settings. you can use the following settings for the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder where the backup should be made. the list of safest files will be updated automatically according to the selected standard folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under backup files, that only those files are stored in the same file system, such as the folder. folders that are located on other file systems, you can register separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independent of the other.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Using an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files secured that since then has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call of tar. this causes that all files will be backed up to a new snapshot file for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons are sums & gt; and lt; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can setup the settings via the menu option KDat... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path has to refer to the non-rewinding version of the belt device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & dat; before the band is bound, the command will load on the drive. for some drives, this is necessary before reading or write operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, tried & dat; the refuse expulsion of the tape work could not work with all band drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, if necessary, the switch is cast out automatically; use this option not at Floppy Streamers' option.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & dat. not all drives support variable log sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you must have & dat; in any case the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & dat; a band formatted, writes a file at the beginning of the band. this file should only fill a memory block on the band. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band-ID. the format of this string is computer name: seconds, the computer name of the full name of the system is formatted on which the tape is formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that has been formatted since the era.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band-ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar-archives that can manage directly with & GNU; - tar to manage. even other tar versions should work as long as it does not comply with incremental fuses.</seg>

<seg id="2941">& ksystem log; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background. it is a simplified diagram of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for unexperienced users who can't know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system is stored on the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, it allows users to provide quick access to the example of information on problems that occur on their server. & ksystem log; therefore attempts to provide some extended functions, and can be evaluated and evaluated using the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 and the system log log; a number of useful features. among others, among others:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included in addition to the further chapters of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screen photo, & ksystem log; functions are available, with their help the individual protocol-lines of a protocol file easily filtering and sort. the individual possibilities for sorting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After launching the system tries and open log log; initially the most important protocol file system of the system - the system protocol takes you to open. the protocol files can be found under Linux in the folder / var / log, for the normal users don't have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filters according to a limited range criterion or according to the filter bar. in the default setting the box contains the selected filters all. then a protocol line is displayed only if in one of the columns you will contain the filter search results.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this place. the string of the filter search results are then balanced only with entries in the selected column. in addition, in the filter bar, select the name of a process, so shows you & ksystem log; all protocol-lines sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default setting and helps you to detect the most important protocol-lines. protocol-lines of level error are displayed with a remarkable color as the protocol-lines of the level display. the color presentation of protocol-lines can be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you would like to display only certain process (e.g. in the system protocol or in the cron Protocol), so you can investigate the process identification (PID) in the column process, if you want to examine the issue of a specific command, such as the launch of the samba server. in this case you can use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can skip the option to new lines on the context menu of the main window to view all the new-coming protocol-lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystem log; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to open this function, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage it. once you select a subwindows, select a protocol to the menu.</seg>

<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & KDE; System V Init Editor, more known (and in the following also called) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init developed quickly to the standard for checking the program start in the & Linux; world. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD-Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I'm not able to enter the historical aspects here (others because I don't know it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The inite-binding file is under / sam and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone could try to make a machine to system V Init, without a reinstallation and reformatting. therefore, you need to see that the old Init was removed from there, if there was there.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The sysV Init also distinguishes itself by the BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead directly in / etc. this folder means rc.the Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for each system. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & broadcast;, httpd & etc; system services does not include such things such as setserial which only started. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie on / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if it does not have much use for this. you can also want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program and starts the first one finds it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably determine that the default Runlevel 3 is possible. if you want to change the default Runlevel 3. if you want to pass the default changes, then you can install anything, then proceed to restart the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start to enter all the right scripts? if you like ls -l in rc3.d, you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder will be no right files. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does and stop unite actually system services? quite simple: any of the scripts is so written that it accepts a argument, like the start and stop. you can actually start this script from hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would be called the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the K includes, the script will be called with the argument. if he contains a S, the script will start with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish you an easy way to create machines for many purposes. I might have & eg; a server running level, which can run only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. furthermore, I could have a user-level, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; kicks off.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or other hand device is simple to say trivial: simply drag an entry from the availability system services to one of the six Runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can move scripts also between Runleveling or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. in this case, the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or his position). this is just not going to extract any entry from the availability system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be postponed if you need to copy these into a new Runlevel, you have to select copying from the menu edit or from the context menu and then enter the target range -- even if the same record has already existed in the target area of the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of this entry may not be calculated sometimes. in such case you must process the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there are currently no possibility to restore entries that have been thrown into the paper basket. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab button to enable the various work areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To push one entry into another Runlevel, move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use ctrl; X) and add it into the desired Runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">In order to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the button to change the properties dialog. connect the tab button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. defaults to the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc), if it is available. otherwise they are stored by & ksysv. changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runlevelling, and now does the machine start constantly. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the lilo -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single use mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution in Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) you need to use additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The species, as system services in these distributions are launched, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary insights programs of these distribution, but does not comply with the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution: check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also if they are located in the right directory). some services (like & eg; Apache or httpd) can easily finish without a message if your configuration files are not available or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send us more about the Runlevel, so that this manual may be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & user; 1.0. with this program you can manage users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & user; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & user; read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you have to save them. either using the respective icon of tool bar or record Save In the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is an easy application. the main window consists of two cardboard cards, the user and user group. to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears to the dialogue user or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some cardboard cards are only represented when you have extended system settings. only if you have limited system settings, you can appear on the individual settings. further boxes cards appear if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The cartons password will appear if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master.passwd are installed such as BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card appears only if for at least an embedded file system space (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here you can change parameters for each user, with the limit of space in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">This parameter can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected using the field of file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The KarteiCard groups informs about the group of the selected user. the group group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the primary group. furthermore, the user can become a member of the group by taking this in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Group's dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select from the menu users or group or click the appropriate adding button of tool bar. editing or erasing of selected users or the selected group works analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can add the lilo boot manager to add the boot word, remove and change the time to booting the standard operation system, remove the default business system, remove, change operating systems, change and more.</seg>
