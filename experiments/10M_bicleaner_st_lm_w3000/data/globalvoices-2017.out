although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my dear to America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily big .
as many of my generation I grew up with American movies , American writers will be read and operated in American music .
in fact , this country had a great pro@@ found effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist .
when I was 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ ite in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ ful repor@@ ter , who covered the former Federal Court with judges who wanted to take his interest to his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the absolute truth , forget everything I want to do with my life &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , I had only strengthened my ad@@ mir@@ ation for the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I always said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose variety is so welcoming that you &apos;re always &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;re always that you are , and it is easy to accept people in a community of equal people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had even written a very narrow love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most unusual aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me , how he moves to its un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess .
he never stops behind the mountain , as you says so beautiful .
he says exactly what he considers , as a former colleague it express , and proclaimed publicly cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ de and Women .
nevertheless , people responded to his testimonies and agreed in pairs for him .
the 13 million votes , which he won with the Republi@@ can election , was the highest number ever reached by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ uous person , I asked myself ?
I was able to bring Tr@@ ump and his elec@@ tors in accordance with men , which I learned during my time in Phoenix during my time .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalist , destro@@ ys people from around the world , a deep guy of believ@@ ing , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
Tr@@ umps did not agree with the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; which is the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ umps Ac@@ ol@@ er@@ ance is also in contrast to the fundamental movement that I experienced by Sandy B@@ ahr , who strug@@ gles for life to the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like their son .
it is still adap@@ ting to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always with patience and suffering from me and my colleagues helped us to reconc@@ ile us to the complexity of the American life .
then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er counsel helped me much with my career .
these people and those caused by em@@ bo@@ red values deep@@ ened my love in America .
while Tr@@ ump in his way to the nominated republi@@ can presidential candidate , they call me a halt and the counter@@ part of his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the con@@ front@@ ation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they shared either its rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , or because they were prepared to over@@ take these things , almost the heart brake me .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to describe the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as a rac@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of my friends , exactly what has led us to this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is super@@ ficial and respec@@ t@@ less and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act on a different way and think .
it shows the people that its wor@@ ries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their churches are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they would like to re @-@ win control over a country , which does it be disappointed ?
with other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps perhaps .
but you hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ n@@ ick , who comm@@ enting the cruel decision to rise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( o. ag@@ ape ) . : as much as &quot; re@@ jection of the White against all Other Eth@@ ics &quot; ; The word game made of white at the White and wh@@ i@@ pl@@ ash , which means the great Van Jones , did it exactly what America did so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background you can always have , America is called every welcome .
because this country chose his president twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ers , whose history , how he himself says that somewhere else in the world .
with the Donald Tr@@ umps , however , there is a huge part of the white America &apos;s promise and says : to Hell with frequent , religious freedom and the entire term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in the America after 9 / 11 the white man will say again at the Ru@@ der , they say .
at all that I have to remember K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , would have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the people responded with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; had Muslims a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ aring the amount .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; answered them .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called them and their voices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would anyone , who isn &apos;t like you , has a place in your America ? &quot;
he received an impressive and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan ended with the words : &quot; thank you , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ umps Country , said the message .
and all the people who like Mr. Khan , could not find no place in this new America .
and mine heart breaks me .

from the mis@@ ery to the stars : these Latin American children let not destroy their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ische City Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
that the music that is played on both places , not only the life of children has changed , but also a close connection with ...
music that lives with the tr@@ ash
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 Kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds of the nearby rural ruins and its world famous cuisine .
since some years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) is now playing in the municipality : one of the children and adults of existing Symph@@ onie Orchestra , which has found its musical instrument a possibility to overcome them surrounding poverty .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , which is located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs @-@ abuse and the B@@ anden violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilots who started a musical project and offered a rare hope .
the young members take their obligations towards the musical group , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch , they run through the du@@ sty streets to meet her great passion .
you always come to and play with shiny eyes and play in the Tru@@ ste@@ els Day for Day Tr@@ ump@@ et , tromb@@ one , Pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from W@@ aste
more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village which lies practically on the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital city - on instruments that are made of recycled waste material :
music with recur@@ rent instruments made of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling line conducted by F@@ avi@@ o Chávez thus started to trans@@ form parts of the waste in instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate violin , fr@@ ying , c@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trumpets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all of which have been made of gar@@ bage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an , Latin American music and music by Beat@@ les , Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez rec@@ alls a local ec@@ ologist and musical teachers of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , to the initial time :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place where parents didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something that he had never seen before : a violin made out of tr@@ ash .
today , there is a complete orchestra which plays on instruments made of recovered material and is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary section &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) draws the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who live with him and live by him are the p@@ oo@@ rest - like people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they walk in a little beauty .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ing spectac@@ le from gar@@ bage @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra recorded music even before Pope Francis :
these eastern African countries show how technology and team@@ work can fight the illegal fisher@@ y
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing fought .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine published specifically for international and practi@@ ced solutions for environmental problems .
the recovery occurs in the context of a deal with Global Vo@@ ices to the common use of content .
in West Africa it was known that this ship had already run illeg@@ ally fishing waters in Liber@@ ian waters before the other coast of Africa had sought .
the Eastern African countries have been associated with this correspon@@ d@@ ingly and slightly inclined , to be called a lawyer for this species to their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ intern , Mozambique and the Seychelles , quickly towards the ship . they refused to serve one of its har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the premi@@ er was surrounded by countries which you simply refused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bene@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan F@@ isheries Authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship and persecuted this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not managed to catch the fish .
at the end , there was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia , due to pill@@ aging the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which protects and protect resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ isheries stop ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar on the six countries who had driven out the Premier of their waters back then .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries and work together and are going to work together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tony Long , Head of P@@ v Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of P@@ ev &apos;s En@@ ding Project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition , which is taken cap@@ tive , is hidden , essential because of it is extremely difficult . therefore , the Il@@ legal fisher@@ y is a main cause of the over@@ fishing of regions .
by clear abuse of existing laws , by which certain hab@@ itats and types are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems which have a del@@ ici@@ ate balance .
however , during the actions against the illegal fishing once caused by bureau@@ cr@@ atic hur@@ dles , these actions happen in real time with the information between individual countries and tra@@ ce@@ able to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , the individual countries , for example , lists existing licenses to exchange lic@@ ences , news to dig@@ est activities or details that you notice during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships even very atten@@ tive when they move around the open lake , using satellite data .
this allows to character@@ ise ships to know ships in banned areas . so , they can discover that a ship gro@@ oves to other ships , so that a ship invites its caught fish on other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the involved ships have a fishing licence , where they were on the way and perhaps , whether they have an off@@ fre@@ ister .
countries that are against illegal fish catch , can be found on the basis of such ships in their ports . what means that the ships could not sell their charge , and that they could even be forced to numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Prime Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is significant financial losses for the owner , meaning that the illegal fishing catch is no longer worth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , Chief Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a mountain company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to re@@ win estimated 20 million USD on lost sales , giving the eight members of the H@@ ISH network each year due to illegal fisher@@ man , penetration in Eastern African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish plants , in the way which the region attrac@@ ts commercial fishing around the world . among these also inv@@ ali@@ ated the illegal fisher@@ man .
other practices include actions like the sailing under false flag , f@@ ake license documents , indication of ph@@ as@@ ien@@ cies , fish protected species and fish in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have targeted the lack of international cooperation and the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ bridge control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ship was illegal to fishing and a country could then say &apos; You must not run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Kom@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this legal gor@@ ge tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies .
it has revealed criminal networks to spread the counter@@ f@@ eit Lic@@ enses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found it trips and found .
due to its collaboration with Inter@@ pol , the international authority for com@@ b@@ ating crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations bring us quite far in the networks of organis@@ ational crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i , suspected ships to be precise .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which has always been developed continuously , helps to hide the illegal ships that would like to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fisher@@ man use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg Mat Tra@@ cking , an N@@ RO as well as F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn on for example their automatic identification systems , which they can no longer be t@@ apped by satellites .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects different information levels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i help to find criminal ships with greater precision .
one model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s Team African nations can actually influence the und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened together with Google and the Maritime Organization Oce@@ ana &quot; platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of each of the tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with neighbours , to get a better picture of it , those who do - that &apos;s just what makes sense &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to join forces and to bund@@ le their resources for the study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project , where a global system must permit the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only sad , but also ab@@ stain from loc@@ ust@@ s .
ships that previously explo@@ ited without license and hardly have to calculate with consequences , know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i took a 33 % increase in fishing net sales , since then fishing boats more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia , Gre@@ ko 1 opened up , the inspec@@ tors took place on board towing systems whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also realize these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that us now also include other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa van@@ ish several hundred million dollars annually by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there will be six countries together in 2015 , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . Moreover , they fight also the Il@@ legal fisher@@ y , according to exactly the same model such as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; with security , even more such initiatives and structures will also arise in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country took part in his first major triumph : in October , Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was under a false flag . and not only the ship was used without a license and were used to use towing networks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also included in banned waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take a strong character that they proceed against illegal fish catch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time , evidence that such a special , collabor@@ ative work worked to protect the oceans . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition .

the street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the President of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela had rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum , the Ven@@ et@@ ians responded to the negotiations on political and economic crisis in the land , in whose eyes were assembled on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the feedback of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among others in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the central region Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , centrally located in the central north of the federal government of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and the Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation deteri@@ or@@ ated continuously , resulting in the everyday life of Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ ans , causing a acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition seen in the office of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro took the chance for a fundamental change ; finally the re@@ jection of a re @-@ election of the official authorities was blo@@ cked .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of the context of the government statement as follows :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , the inflation rate is among the highest in all over the world ( the inflation rate is considered to be 500 % at the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine is considered to give the chance to pursue its institutional structures and a new government alliance .

the call has been commented on Twitter among others as follows :

the first demonstration in the framework of the Action Program &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the pictures of the mart@@ ens , which will be published in real time , testify among others , an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also conflict with polic@@ emen and advoc@@ ates of the government .
one of the most often shared pictures shows an protest@@ ers who calls through the sh@@ ields of them : &quot; will you kill me , because I have hungry ? &quot;

especially large waves struck the message on police repression in central @-@ north @-@ north city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there , demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and armed forces of the government .
hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went further .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to keep police forces , including those woman in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :

meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic shows the round , which forms the magn@@ itude of oppression a day :

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine city Córdoba .
as an adult husband said Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cordoba against his father .
in the trial which ended on 24 August 2016 , a crime was examined , which were committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano is not looking for his life .
starting at the Bür@@ de , the same name as his father carry up to the brutal military operations in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years , he retained the family secrets for himself .
in the situation then I believed that was in order .
I felt like a secret .
as a child with 15 years , you don &apos;t notice that one will be manip@@ ulated by his father .
I was not able to know that my father was a thief , follow@@ er and a mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ e@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Prime Minister 141 in the prison of La Per@@ la .

this is not the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano , the oppressed , which is charged with ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and ab@@ duction of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ anos Son , a man who had experienced the magn@@ itude of the atro@@ cities which he had experienced as boy , and who told his own father against his own father .
its history shows what great power has a par@@ ental part over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . there I had always made me with a boys , the mar@@ tial sport .
all they called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ and photo and ur@@ ged me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are a sh@@ ole , you have been rounded to you with one of the ERP .
pass just that they don &apos;t lead you a day and I must save you then .
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito revolutions del Pueb@@ lo , the Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina .
therefore he charged me to go back into the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me , I would be obe@@ dient .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that was in order . for so my father had moved me .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers of the prisoners .
all possible documents : fac@@ tions , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , pro@@ pane , books , books , simple everything .

&apos;@@ da@@ w@@ ning the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
my father accepted me four times after La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
at the first and during the last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he charged me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - simply everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little hammer to wrap it in a blan@@ ket , and told me to wear it . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ umps of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke , where the stolen objects have been turned and under@@ took me with a guard .
suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said :
here the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I drove in , and saw a couch in which people were tor@@ tured .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that she paved the end of a cable . the other end was fixed on the body of the person who had just there .
they put a man with hand cells to the bed , over@@ shot him with water and pursued it a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ itals .

the gest@@ ure there was terrible ... like a dirty winch .
years later , when my father got under house arrest , the same od@@ our came out of his room .
I realized the smell immediately and I was clear that the smell of a body is in trouble .
I never could forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible that a man can do so much evil ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father brought me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the det@@ ain@@ ees were folded and bound to ophthalm@@ ology .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; L@@ op@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilians who was also charged in the process ) and I used the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked people with the face down . all were on hands and feet .
close to the surgery man quiet@@ ly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noted that I saw to the prisoner , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look so , Ar@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why did you answer me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers .
I know this , because my father told her home .
besides La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms that were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero killed there a man and killed .
( according to the survivors of the Civil is Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera &apos;s trial , students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Molina was also charged to death ) .
in the following video , Emil@@ io F@@ essi@@ a , the director of the memorial La Per@@ la , led by the former Fol@@ ding chambers .
the path where you came in here is also the way where they arrived here .
if you look at the map , see that they took about this way and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned to as part of the process of de@@ formation a number .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came to be transferred .
this was a lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War Gra@@ ph &apos;
my father brought all possible things done by home .
at that time in the age I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - as they called it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when I was later on the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I was clear that the spo@@ ils was an bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military badge , who fought against an enemy who fought against an enemy .

but if you go into a house and the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then does not affect the spo@@ ils but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve always wonder@@ ed , as my father , the leader of security forces , with this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have failed to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do this .
once he called me a crimin@@ als and I said : and you , whom thou do@@ est cars on the street ?
you are no crime ?
he explo@@ ded pl@@ ut , struck me , and cried out , saying ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you go so far , I will find you and embra@@ ce you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we don &apos;t need any others !
that was my father .
I have no only good memory to him .
when I said in the trial , I showed a photo of that back on which I wore a jacket and a roll @-@ swe@@ ater of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
at the time he accused me of war , a co @-@ ad@@ j@@ ure for this crime . I said , no problem , they can put me to the burden which they wanted .
I was anyway there to speak .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the dead is the last ab@@ h@@ or act &apos;
now , where I am older , feel more sensitive .
I have children . if one has just one children , you know the value of a life .
it develops further and recognizes that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , you have ex@@ iled during the dictatorship of mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for what the cor@@ p@@ ses let van@@ ish disappear ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why children escape ?
one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always set the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they would just have been able to bring it just into prison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess it was just decided to kill these people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for what kind of glu@@ ing disappear ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did they not also families who could surrender their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the dead is the last ab@@ h@@ or act that one can do a man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they found machines to eliminate the remains of the prisoners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were m@@ illed and somewhere there - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but anything else remains forever .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you have killed people ! &apos;
only to declare it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just have said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the thought that signi@@ fy my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I did him for him because of all the abom@@ inations that I had to visit him because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have killed there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , and asked me what the entire patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they were repor@@ tedly def@@ ended , actually were good .
then I cried :
how can you say anything to me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed aw@@ ful crimes and you have forced me as a child to join me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he answered only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then don &apos;t show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly what did I do .
in 2010 I re@@ charged the first display .
I finally knew that he was a criminal crimin@@ als .
nobody can re@@ ject me that I &apos;m pre@@ occupied with my own father .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magn@@ itude of the judgement .
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera Process ended with crimes against humanity committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims in August .
43 oppressed were found guilty of crimes against humanity for crimes against humanity . sentenced in 28 cases li@@ fel@@ ong sentence and in nine cases of adher@@ ence between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were hands @-@ free .
eleven of originally 54 accused died during the trial .

an translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation errors in a center in Kyoto where one can extend his driving licence .
the photo was spread in social media .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend his driving licence , in the last month , a very particularly ab@@ stain@@ ed translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ko@@ rei@@ un@@ ten@@ sh@@ a ) , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but perhaps also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was translated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read in the input area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
adaptation of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was divided into social media .
the error was to the trans@@ lat@@ ors of Julian Holmes , a population of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was it also who made attention to the local time .
in the Kyoto @-@ published daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation .
this is an ins@@ ult for older people and in an international city such as Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drive &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot; was later replaced by appropriate , if the gramm@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was replaced by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police pre@@ fecture of the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture . furthermore , it declared that the error was included in the text that they had received from the translator , and that the translation was not checked for their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published .
a B@@ logger was reported as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry that elderly people with@@ drew from the in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) on the other hand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ cast News is a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan &quot; and wrote :
the word &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; was used as an appropriate description of older motor@@ ists . according to the police , the proportion of older motor@@ ists are involved in the country , however , are quite easy to worry .
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by senior citizens . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , the Senior Citi@@ zens were 1.8@@ 03 from a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of seniors caused by senior citizens in the same period has risen in the same period .
the nam@@ ing @-@ mentioned repor@@ ter was published in the version of article comments on light which show the advantages of some Japanese seem@@ ingly against older motor@@ ists :
the article on Yahoo on the translation errors , among others , received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drive &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If the translation is wrong , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that there is a real translation errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in all Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true place of mine for this bizar@@ re error in English .

the reasons for the wide preval@@ ence of trans@@ lat@@ ors are diverse .
for example , you need two important abilities : passive language skills to understand the output text and are active language skills to transfer him to the destination language .
the latter requires the active rule of the target language - something that is in the case of the native language . generally , the convic@@ tion that trans@@ lat@@ ors should be in the target language - not in the language language - native language .
this should not be a French native language for example from English to French - not from the French in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ employees with English as the native language that could just@@ ify translations into English . this may be done in lack of understanding for the overweight , quot@@ ations or the relatively small number of English speakers that can learn Japanese .
some companies that have not have any foreign employees , yet have translations fir@@ stly . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered to be the best in English - no matter how good or bad his language knowledge are truly remarkable .

machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ ents and r@@ ig@@ matic sentences created by mechanical translations will show that this technique may replace long no human translator . this applies to some languages very particularly .
some of the most strange English formulation in Japan , among them the sm@@ ooth@@ est prints , often used T @-@ shirts or pockets , are used only from stylish reasons - not to be read or understood even .

translation errors like beauty are still acceptable or at least harm@@ less . but by major companies or from the government , which have funds to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the City of Kyoto uses a serious source of their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protest and cen@@ sored measures on the Internet and TV
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ ach@@ con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Frei@@ es Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to PR@@ EN@@ SA y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ elan Internet users said that they would have no access to the Viv@@ op@@ lay online .
later , other users wrote that the Internet access from V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV will be no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ caster , including the protests of the protests in Caracas , organized by op@@ positi@@ onal groups , to resist the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tra@@ cer@@ o . he pointed out that the connection was glued , and recommended the user to get VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that internet pages of Venezu@@ elan providers are blo@@ cked again .
that is from the site of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular among dental vene@@ ers with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
since 2014 , traditional media has been discus@@ sing protests against protests . then the Commission threatened them with fin@@ es and lock@@ ers when they would continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission reported this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and inform@@ ational national TV channels , I signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that it is still cheaper than to buy two litre lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO Association @-@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Viv@@ op@@ lay can be in@@ accessible by a blocking of the domain name System ( DNS ) , but also two further online channels . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions .
earlier editions of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers can stop DNS . thereby , it is a technique to answer the DNS server requests of certain domains .
if a website is blo@@ cked by DNS , the server answered correct or denied the request when calling such an website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ ap@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
for V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third switched channel , the transmission was set on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V camera was Elvis Flo@@ res which was arrested in Caracas .
Flo@@ res was defeated , while he was arrested in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went online again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government was regulated by the government to regul@@ ate the vene@@ ers on access to multi media coverage over the current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls will be a slave to get an apprentices@@ hip
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was born as a child a Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collec@@ ts witness testimonies of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , who were exactly like them victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the version of a report by Kur@@ dish , published by Global Vo@@ ices with the friendly permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ is@@ que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where they did not live together with the family that lived there .
shortly before her studies at the university , she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house full of pride spoke about them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as cri@@ m@@ ita for the family . as cri@@ m@@ itas , the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to work to school .
the shop is very simple : a big family with little money survived their minor son or her min@@ ors daughter to another , more abundant family . in exchange the child gets food , training and one roof over the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this is not mentioned above , the children must pay for countless days of house@@ work which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that can not raise up in the context of a contract that cannot rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as Cri@@ m@@ az@@ go practice , this is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organizations wide .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fought for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testimony , resear@@ ched and den@@ oun@@ ced .
it tried to name the things in the name because the feeling of grat@@ itude that is vacc@@ inated with Cri@@ ad@@ itas , guaranteed in general stand@@ still .
&quot; the Cri@@ m@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is the family that her daughter is in the faith that they dis@@ close their training to improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can make something from themselves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family , who takes up the girl in itself and whose exploitation is just@@ i@@ fies with faith , that they would not get a chance that would not get an apprentices@@ hip , or maybe even hungry .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is har@@ assed , his family will be experienced until many years later .
sometimes they never experienced it .
so far , in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret of par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , was a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín entered into the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her bodies showed a severe dro@@ pping . shortly afterwards , she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military personnel of Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a officials at the resident .
Mar@@ ín lived in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants , located 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ on .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira proposed a first stop on Mar@@ ín until it suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations like UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela was responsible for the deeply situated in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ m@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest commis@@ sions together and demanded that there was no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are more cows registered as children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , in which conditions boys and girls live .
the neigh@@ bors of the wife and almost 60 civil society organisations sought a generous investigation of the case .
they want to celebrate Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case occurs in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark , when the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is coming from court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas will not only be explo@@ ited as a workforce , they are still isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ mers , where their father worked , bank@@ rupt@@ cy , and her father lost its work .
your brothers had to work all work , and began to sell on the street or on the market , to earn money .
but they went all further to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita to the capital of As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of her employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
in doing so , they had to share the time that you still stayed in learning .
she stood at five o &apos;clock in the morning and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
on Fri@@ days , they pur@@ ged the refrigerator , the living room , polished the furniture , and the infected the ground .
when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time to learn .
the more time they had finished with learning , the more leisure had her .
yet this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says that she was never an hung@@ ered , but did not get an unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the house@@ keeping as food from the fridge . &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the House@@ hold liberal , a former military and sympath@@ izers of the Parti@@ do liberal , a liberal party , which was part of the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in some evenings of the House@@ er@@ r Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , beside him and leaders of opposition groups such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; can be read .
in doing this , he tried to convince them to give the reports of the official media about the regime of the dict@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he indeed held her for intelligent , but didn &apos;t last with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stew@@ er@@ r had found someone who spoke about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cannot tell me to visit my family because they were the opinion that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of the Guaran@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would say good@@ bye to the indigenous group of the Guaran@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their lord were afraid that they might know their formation , that they might lose their might , and explains it .
however , it was completely clear that she had paid for everything that she had paid for them with their hard work .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discrimin@@ ated in the school . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken , are mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who are Cri@@ ad@@ itas when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they acknowledge immediately that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I could not leave at home at home . I had no friends of friends in the school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the period where friend@@ ships will emer@@ ge , I felt very much that I was in no group .
the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .

draft bill to register Egyptian users social media , to register with the government

sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections recently voted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; voted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regulation concerning utility and usage of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he is accepted by Parliament , users of social media must register in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law then it would be set up a place that was commissioned to use Citi@@ zens , citizens and citizens to share social media .
within six months with acceptance of the law , users would have to register for users with their right name and staff numbers to use social networks .
if it is failed to do this , this could bring a penalty of up to six months of imprisonment or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs , and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which is going through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video messages and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is accepted if there is no indication , as Egyptian authorities cannot order the registration that the Egyptian government is not able to register that the Egyptian government is currently not able to guarantee the regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Parliament and promot@@ er of the Law , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and user received a user name and a password &quot; to come through the fire@@ wall , which blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to create a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary for Egyptian inside and Egyptians , to submit information regarding their identity , to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts and experts on site are sk@@ ep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the prevention .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist , &quot; the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , on German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights , &quot; said Global Vo@@ ices :
I strongly committed to the technical capacities and the understanding of neither authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my opinion , they imagine that same as they can change physical state and private rooms can also be done online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I serious it , then it means that they may apply a strong surveillance system to apply a permit , or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring it to a trial process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legisl@@ ature of Parliament and the constitu@@ tion@@ aries before it goes into the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and en@@ forcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military thinking of parliament in whose sense does control maxim@@ izes and ensured that no different fol@@ ds on the image area is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y proposed a legislative power against cy@@ ber @-@ crimin@@ ality , which was planned for a life imprisonment for those who want to become guilty of &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest against protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in Nor@@ theast of Iraq work the animal @-@ assisted h@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq to protect the spiritu@@ ally Persian le@@ op@@ ard .
a sub@@ species of the major family of Leop@@ ards , which affects Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ard ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . overall there are between 800 and 1.000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , loss and frag@@ mentation of their hab@@ itat , because they always find less prey , vulner@@ able .
why is this specific type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
like R@@ aza in the video , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pir@@ ate in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem , and the health and the growth of the ecos@@ ystem itself also depends on that a big rob@@ ber is present .
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the free wild . when the team compet@@ ed in the video , it seems that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera , breaks R@@ aza in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ olog@@ in , R@@ aza is passionate about another side of their country , which is not only made out of war and conflict .
it has been involved in field studies with wild animals and educational programs by Nature Iraq for six years .
it has also been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Specialist Group since 2013 and is aimed at that protected areas for bo@@ animals in the Kurdistan region .

in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ vaccine , the progress made in the North East of Japan have been achieved to re@@ build the life of those who had been re@@ formed by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three @-@ fold catastrophe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of March 2011 . the disaster was triggered by disaster accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung is located in Th@@ ai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture - Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture , had to experience the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami pre@@ fecture .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neigh@@ bor of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced evacu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ished whole coasts of the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture still experienced a nuclear accident , already around 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o is reflected in the local vision of the progress made six years later to re@@ build the life of local farmers .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of Japanese re @-@ building authorities as well as survey results of the data subject .
the housing estate in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
in December 2015 , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that 77 per cent of the planned spare homes ( s ) ( s ) , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were finished in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i &apos;s largest success was achieved by Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i &apos;s three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned spare buildings were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has finished 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened at 70 percent the final light .
even six years after the catastrophe , still six years after the disaster , evacu@@ ated from accommodation ( s ) , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) had to be moved to defin@@ itive replacement houses .
after the three @-@ fold catastrophe , almost 80 000 people were forced to live in Beh@@ avi@@ ths .
in December 2016 still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such accommodation .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still living in not@@ ices , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i had more successful . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated people were evacu@@ ated after the disaster in the home of accommodation .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is below 34 percent .
the state of works and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by the disaster , opened its doors to December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction is far more difficult in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
while almost 100 percent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are again put into operation , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of fishing ports are re@@ generated .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident , have moved in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land in partnership .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed ar@@ able farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is un@@ likely that only one episode of the nuclear accident is , because only 690 hectares are destroyed out of 5 400 hectares of destroyed ar@@ able land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in the &quot; nuclear area . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered extensively , but also Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far off .
the tourist pay in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent on the same stand as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima can only be 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it seems more difficult to earn their hab@@ itat .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine a complete picture , the newspaper introduced many surveys under local population and evacu@@ ated under evacu@@ ation . she asked them about the state of re@@ building , and how you &apos;ll find our receiving directly opposite the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in its introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey conducted by more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population in experience .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the resident population have seized measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in Cat@@ ast@@ roph@@ es prevention has been done .
how about those who had evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has increased their attention to the situation of evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima did not only experience the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened also a witness of the worst , cat@@ ast@@ roph@@ ic accident in Japan .
of 160 000 people evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were some more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , permanent replacement houses .
after the 2017 stand still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live outside their country pre@@ fecture .
most of the evacu@@ ated areas , most of the evacu@@ ated areas , which are still in Beh@@ avi@@ aries , are known as 50 years old . it is necessary to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is about construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games , which will be held in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;

these global connections are important , since they call our pre@@ judi@@ ces to make our perspectives and remember that the world is ultimately very small .
in this sequence of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global compounds . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often won less attention when they earn less attention .

right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva at a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia was defeated by a protest against the head . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against savings .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social science at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull of brain trau@@ ma and several fra@@ c@@ tures .
doctors operated him this Saturday and have now transferred him into an artificial com@@ a .
its condition is considered critical .
the local picture journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus that rapidly attracted quickly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures , the face of the police officer can be seen , the man identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police handed out in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the incident reported by the active service .
the pictures show the police officials , as he proposes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was checked by an protest@@ ers , his face would be seen in television for six months , and the entire oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ k@@ al@@ iz@@ ador , &quot; a press release of media activ@@ ist from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , divided by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , which is attacked by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , where he is attacked by the police officer and several san@@ ter shortly to him .
another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective is filmed too , is also immersed in social networks .
the clip shown below shows the attack on Mat@@ eus starting from 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10.000 Braz@@ ilians re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to meet a portion of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be vali@@ ant , Mat@@ eus .
to police force . &quot;
the drawing was divided several times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for more violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás had witn@@ essed a wave of political force : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me was murdered by his father , because he was an inv@@ aded school with a gas le@@ ck . and now , we had attacked the very sad fall by Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira . and now , we had attacked the very sad school after he was attacked by a polic@@ emen who put him to the face .
police over@@ handles
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where the police entered the police custody on Friday last Friday .
polic@@ emen were sitting at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , rubber Com@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
the dep@@ uties Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , social and peace party ( PS@@ OL ) , imp@@ lo@@ red the police via loudspeaker announ@@ cements against protest@@ ers .
this is also a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again , the Brazilian media is negoti@@ ating , taking the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window disc .
the fol@@ klore de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported a targeted glass window to illustr@@ ate its cover pages with a photo .
however , the O global@@ o preferred a title story with a set of bus on the back .
there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more on a broken window disc than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing .
this must also be recogni@@ zing when you are stri@@ pped against any type of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a ab@@ sur@@ d , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate importance , and the typical violence of the military police are explo@@ ded by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators on con@@ front@@ ation course with the police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the villages forgotten by the kidn@@ apping villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso nearly hundreds of sugar pipes produced throughout Cuba ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the Municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the Western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is widely known as a Central - on Spanish Sug@@ ar mill - known , regardless of what there is no significant sugar harvest .
it is two years ago when the activities were produced in the sugar tube plants .
following the proceeds , the sugar cane industry in the region still lost , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the rum@@ ours of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to find themselves .
some changes the work .
other re@@ signed and comm@@ ences every day on the factories which still grinding .
N@@ ene , a solo veter@@ an who resi@@ sts every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry is smo@@ ked to sleep .
he heard that there are in the East of the Sug@@ gest@@ ion factories that have been in operation after a long @-@ active time , because they were preserved .
it was something that he was not expected .
N@@ ene reminds himself that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ or the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the I@@ ne@@ ph@@ ering , the poor administration decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the message would have been a motive for the country some decades ago , but the bad conditions have been no more re@@ alism .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was a economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive they were un@@ tra@@ cked for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tons .
they only left the factories that produce sugar for up to 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ fs that led to these measures were low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the care rise in the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again before a decade .
from 2017 to 2025 , the cost of un@@ refined sugar is to remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published by the OECD and FAO , the Agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations .
if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the cru@@ de sugar would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything ran good
&quot; today &apos;s Day is going to enter into history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
from then , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane factories came out , over 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same thing happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 . may 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word that he is most repeated , &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
nearly all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to get the place , they set a full time - working group .
in front of the first phase of the year , the first letters started to come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was officially declared documents that would be removed only concerning the parts that would be removed , the address and the date . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all were signed by Ul@@ timo Ros@@ ales del Toro , but the minister was able to appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from there , the responsibility was over@@ looked , and the letters came increasingly more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money covered for the still in operation . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years waiting for retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the stand@@ still of the factory , whose construction he helped , was involved .
with each portion which he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years .
the most developed industrial sector in Cuba and most important work of work was deleted .
in many cases , no alternatives for the employment and services that were generated in the municipalities were generated , in which they found themselves .
we will never know whether during the Mamm@@ alog@@ y address of 21 October 2002 , the time president in the eyes of those present people saw , when he guaranteed , whose factories was not in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of the su@@ gar@@ cane production plants
since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years , the Municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich that many things may change , but not always for better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory completed , or better , when they began to dis@@ assem@@ ble it , they also heard on asphalt road that dis@@ advant@@ aged other companies .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy other factories had to look .
they were to spare parts .
without future prospects , many young people left the region once again .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma factory , the ruins of the place where he began working .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty ten@@ ants bring an ancient of two thousand pes@@ o per month to spend the years in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear@@ er voice , is no subsequent person , yet he gives the lies that one told him not .
she has ra@@ ced him for ten years .
N@@ ene comes with 65 years in R@@ ente , not because it is lack@@ ing in force , but because he is bitter .

first Nations youth use H@@ ip Hop to express itself and maintain their own culture
recording a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with the approval of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
young people from the First Nations communities in all Canada are dealing with topics that are important for them . they do with hip hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an Tour , since 2014 , workshop manager for mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres , to offer youth groups son@@ g@@ writing , photo , audio and video production and live appearances .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agogue David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with Cre@@ e H@@ ip Hop Group The North@@ Stars .
the workshop is thus that young participants in convers@@ ations topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; or whatever is found in mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na ac@@ sa &apos; yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a street section in West@@ can@@ ada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were killed or murdered .
the cases were largely implemented .
the next video of the Nem@@ k@@ hi Cre@@ e First nation uses the motif of a video player to mediate , as important from the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences through global@@ ization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people have not always rule the languages of First Nations .
in the following song that Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation have recorded , the refra@@ in is sung in Cre@@ e .
the young people took a little help from Gary J@@ olly by the North@@ stars H@@ ip Hop Group who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect of Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an , the st@@ rop@@ he is available in writing , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel , no one would ever be interested in me
but I try to go on earth for my days
this is the day that you will take our scre@@ am
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will raise us a day
I would not like to see how they live a bad life
so you can grow and are as well as our youth
so you can do it , for what it is determined by the Creator
in the commentary box , the reader and supp@@ orter of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a post and adds the St@@ anz@@ he in Sil@@ icon ( which is also published on his blog and will be re@@ published here on his blog ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant of plastic dishes .
to show potential customers , what exactly are on the menu , will be exhibited in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( Fig . ) , &quot; Plastic Models of the dishes &quot; ) of each food is served in this restaurant .
the customers can see these plastic geri@@ es and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to manufacturing these plastic dishes .
in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi &apos;s district , there is a variety of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes , which documented the German film@@ makers W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these are these plastic gro@@ unded so usually that they are not even more to all . a new trend turns it today in remarkable cell accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
in N@@ aver Mat@@ ome , the B@@ atal@@ og@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos , show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ let .
now in special sale : new with plastic shred@@ ded mobile phone t@@ apes , as shown in K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u purchase house .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed to kit@@ ten collection objects , as in this case , refriger@@ ant mag@@ nets :
here are a few sho@@ res refriger@@ ated refriger@@ ated for a new exhibition at Tokyo Station .
the new boom of the essence becomes increasingly difficult .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) is transformed into a mobile phone support .
for these tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile support .
also this part we have produced for the exhibition at the Tokyo station .
and here is an apple , using your mobile phone :
designed to look like a apple , with a score for the mobile phone , this is a great design .
and that is just the beginning of an increasing arrival .
some mobile @-@ stand and mobile @-@ designer allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , ic@@ ura or sal@@ mon are used , a popular t@@ opping , served with white rice .
on Twitter a few users had their doub@@ ts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is someone who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wow , cool , now I can strip my mobile phone with sal@@ mon ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic geri@@ es can also accept a less appet@@ ite form to surprise colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant .
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice .
furthermore , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands of dried sal@@ mon .
other sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be seen under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s N@@ aver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # 2 . it &apos;s very smooth .
if you want to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry , such as the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ let .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes actually be manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the Stru@@ g@@ gle against organized Cri@@ me
&quot; to the victims of the fight against drug tra@@ der . &quot;

in reports in@@ - and foreign media about the inf@@ am@@ ous &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking in Mexico only dive in statistics . however , these reflected not the extent of human tragedy against that this struggle with itself .
the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , chief of the Sin@@ al@@ oa card , ur@@ ged the stories of the victims of conflict in the background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the day after a violent incident , someone looks at the trau@@ ma or to the churches who have learned to live with the pain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind each dead body , behind each bon@@ ding in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wo@@ unds may never heal .
for this reason , the Mexican Intelligence portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug traff@@ icking , &quot; ) and stories of people who told this victims in the fight between criminal prosecution authorities and cart@@ els .
Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project so :
organic crime lets us not only fear our lives .
the effects are much pro@@ found .
for example , if shops close because it will be threatened by drug tra@@ ders and all municipalities have to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear lives &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who finds secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who only lost their father &apos;s four si@@ bl@@ ings , their husband and two their ne@@ phe@@ w .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priest : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again to the task of which we have prepared , go and go to graves after the men who we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me , for I am now with three children who need a training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still my mother , which is also here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will receive the insurance of my Father , but he will not receive them out , because they ask a death certificate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have not only show the faces of those who are anxi@@ ety . we must show the international community with conflicts , frag@@ ility and the State leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reading of Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero .
your contribution reminds us that one should never consider that violence should never be considered normal , in which form it occurs :
I know disease and sens@@ ation journ@@ alism now for some years .
I come every day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover pages with images that are actually only from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from files by specialists .
it brings me from the version .
sometimes I have the feeling when I am the only one who is wi@@ sted or sad . it acts as a lack of respect to the person who was once belonged to this body .
I cannot be usually valid or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old c@@ ousin think that he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people listen to the &quot; hel@@ mets &quot; of the offen@@ ders &quot; when they go through the streets .
for me , it is that , when would they lose those who have lost someone , and those that fear them , even something happened .
I see our weakness when stories to blo@@ oming numbers in a statistic .
the facts of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified by it . &quot;
I think they try to agree that they are spar@@ ed out of such trage@@ dies when they are not stirring and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of press@@ age in the main city area : as a family with thre@@ ats were lo@@ oted . &quot; in this , she describes how the armed crime month of her business was not only destroyed by the end , but also her family apart .
you think of everything you lost , and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear cometh again , when you are alone .
hab@@ its have changed , phone numbers too .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the other we are removed , the better .
she completed her report with the words :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to be arrested , because they don &apos;t know when they will escape or kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I asked me in this terrible days , but it would answer my deep@@ ening feelings , but the reply is no , because I have forgotten how to weep . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega released the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions on how : who car@@ es about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by the organized crime ?
how is it possible to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of her .
Br@@ yan is a Wa@@ ise and he tells us that he needed himself , how to make a egg co@@ iled , potatoes br@@ oth , tort@@ illas warm and &quot; Ch@@ ich@@ i &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
it tells of the nine fol@@ ks on his left hand side - one for each year .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and had to learn to live thereby .
when he was five years old , one told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years before , when he was just a few blocks from his home , the bloody suffering of his father , who was shot by armed men from an exempl@@ ary car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez saw that :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was organized through the organized crime and fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of citizens according to the Council of Public Security and the Government of the United States government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosecutor was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this is equivalent to 8.5 Mor@@ ning per day .
these are just some of thousands of thousands of stories which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate it into the country &apos;s soul .
only few stories still live in view of the new head@@ lines . this project is remin@@ is@@ cent of us that we must not forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; in 2015 , the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ co has established the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ tured the country over the past four decades , in intelli@@ gible way .
if one image is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing &quot; from the Fli@@ ck@@ r User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this post and the pages , to which he is linked , include pictures , on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment in which it comes to raise a rum@@ or or a f@@ eit counter@@ f@@ eit .
but how is the year after something is di@@ pped the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether or not true , tend to exist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
ever since its first publication , it became mis@@ leading to images , trage@@ dies , which actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false copy of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Draft News - den@@ ies not the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but asking questions about our desire to images .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tank car sur@@ passed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted and explo@@ ded . 230 people came to life .
after the civil war , Africa was neg@@ lec@@ ted in the second largest country and thus devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous hat@@ ch , that were difficult to drive .
typically the tank car fell victim to the tank .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bureau@@ cracy described a fire ball , who cover dozens of houses including a cinem@@ as in the vicinity , which was full of people who saw the FIFA World Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
houses ro@@ oted and stolen cor@@ p@@ ses in the streets scattered .
many people were burned to in@@ corrup@@ ti@@ bility .
a picture with the title &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the gray scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of carbon@@ ized bodies , which are lying on the ground during persons .
but here does not find the story here .
over the years the same photo has been refresh@@ ed several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , but not so that in the context of the trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the ent@@ le@@ gen@@ ic settlements of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dra@@ stically of atro@@ cities , before which they had to escape .
houses and shops were burnt down and car@@ cases in streets and bus@@ hes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed back to count the dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a people to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were z@@ oned , shot , or burned .
only from satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be displayed .
the reason for the attack remained un@@ explained , but the army @-@ based in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of the B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here &apos;s the picture from the DR Congo again , when it was a proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ chief use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of false ten@@ ders ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was taken as a cover for mass@@ ages .
another step further bring personal comments such as this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments .
the painting also occurred in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a ligh@@ tening , published by the United Nations , those who escape could escape s@@ lows , rape and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported on violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Post@@ s like the following that these descriptions were compiled with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from a Saudi Arabian news page , which claimed in 2012 , the President of My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ ein being said , mon@@ ks and polit@@ ician would have participated in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to give this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other news organisations who called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AFP as their source known as their source , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had not attributed to this statement , but did not have the picture taken from the DR Congo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false coupling goes back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come back across all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; controversi@@ al picture search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far more information can be exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a controversi@@ al picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 344 pictures , which are very similar to the discussed picture from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mask private pages , platforms social media and Community as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have re@@ directed wrong reports , others have tried to expos@@ e the counter@@ f@@ eit counter@@ f@@ eit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have used examples of mis@@ used use by the respective countries , on the basis of which , on which page they were published . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore we want the reach of more clearly than the language alone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several examples of abuse have been linked from the listed below ( which in some cases ) can be used for mis@@ use .
here some cases that can now be stopped completely ( on the map in orange ) :

as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .

this post , who raised to members of the Russian Orthodox Church , real@@ izes that the image of the DR Congo is not aware of Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein has cleared up His 2012 that mon@@ ks and polit@@ ician had been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image .
the article was updated in 2014 and the time of this publication can be included in the picture .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been converted by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , has expressly declared that the Catholic , close to the news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image is not of the k@@ illings , but it claims that it claims a &quot; similar d@@ ull @-@ dist@@ ic attack . &quot;
as the picture later , in connection with the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is sought to resist that there would be connections to Nigeria .

they wanted to achieve that their communities had found this events which took mut@@ at@@ ly in the name of the Islam@@ s , a major attention .
United States , 2015 .
the painting was wit@@ ched as a cover for the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ dge ) . but the messages that were connected with it were not taken in a religious context .
instead , the objective , attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Maltese ) , 2014 .
after a message , supp@@ os@@ edly had written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacres , in circulation , discus@@ sing the discussion like this here in Vietnamese and declared it to Fal@@ se .
from the embassy where the image from the DR Congo was found , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Missionary Society and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os were dist@@ illed .
there are further confirmed examples of a defective use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the folder in Grau ) , Tin@@ Eye is also not tra@@ ce@@ able to tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , the Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time / date post@@ mark exist on the Web@@ cra@@ wler as well as in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only far after the original accident of 2010 , the picture is possibly a correct description but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames ( ir@@ radiation ) that go through this post@@ s . the first frame focus on religion .
the photo was used in terms of major discussions about silence in connection with the murder of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second Fr@@ aming was used to discuss how a African life is being evaluated compared to a European or French life .
religion understood and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is necessary to investigate how images can be used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is , however , what happens when reading these pictures cannot give longer faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with social media there are many people who have been un@@ intended to practice the water around a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sug@@ ger@@ ated this mood of the false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and tast@@ es the real atro@@ cities which is actually done in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the for@@ ci@@ ble images have already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
a argument is that the retention of images of a ref@@ usal is equivalent to detect the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even requested by the victims .
at the same time , wor@@ ried that violent images are readers and spectators disinf@@ ect and get the capability to emp@@ ath@@ y emp@@ ath@@ y ( such as this study , the sought how to help hal@@ ve media to help others ) .
while there are quite a lot of for@@ ci@@ ble represent@@ ations in the news media , fact is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uni@@ qu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Simmons is used in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. un@@ think@@ able ) ende@@ av@@ ours to offer language enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world who are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words are available in each language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specifically .
some of these un@@ checked words are already well @-@ known ( like the famous Portuguese acid ) and others that are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish s@@ lows ) .
but all contra@@ sts are persistent every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not sufficient to understand why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is necessary to understand what is meant with this one word .
these unique words were collected for a full time in an online list .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese , Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist from &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog you can find words from V@@ anu@@ at@@ u language words , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ ü@@ h to take care of your parents in recognition of how to ende@@ av@@ oured you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ q language that are spoken in parts of Brazil , as :
&quot; kw@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or sl@@ oth , which one feels under the cold in cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words in his blog over :
they grin@@ d other cultures , un@@ veil other ideas and we@@ aves our cur@@ i@@ osity .
sometimes , as we influence the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page , and show more these &quot; unbe@@ atable &quot; words and show how differently , precious and impres@@ sively these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Red@@ ner of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treasure Languages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are very appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload your favorite words here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka is the worst disaster of the decade
the island &apos;s State of Sri Lanka currently sees the worst flood water and hei@@ g@@ low disaster in this decade .
triggered by the sun sun , which usually ends end of May , are caused by strong ra@@ ins the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country on the shore .
after a statement by the cat@@ ast@@ roph@@ ic center of Sri Lanka , on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missed due to the floods and battles .
over 400 000 people have been affected since the last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100 000 people were killed in 304 safe areas .
the ra@@ ins left on Saturday ( 27th May ) , and the resi@@ du@@ es went slowly back in some areas .
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos provide an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
flood water in Ta@@ ov@@ ama City with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates for flood water situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly flu@@ ency , den@@ oun@@ ced the den@@ oun@@ cing crisis , war@@ ns Save the Children , after other ra@@ ins are already on the way .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus stood in the flood , water level up to 6 metres . village Mor@@ ago@@ da in G@@ all also floo@@ ded about the Mor@@ og@@ oda El@@ a for yesterday .
the Air Force has made five planes for lif@@ ying actions and further five are made to transport of emergency supplies for which included in their over@@ flow@@ ed villages .
various organizations and start@@ ups have prepared themselves to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od V@@ IC@@ TI@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about flood situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams are required for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all those who want to don@@ ate dry food and li@@ ver@@ ted goods for flood victims -
we are now in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 , if animals need help in this area .
the tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their position data with the help of the app so that the Cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum is informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; high water aid &quot; button , which allowed users to pick up a vehicle to pick up help and donations . these were then forwarded to the sr@@ c Red Cross .
in addition , they led a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which had more than thousands of requests and 150 successful boat tra@@ ps to be caused by floods to a result of the human being .
the unified efforts of the government and civilian population of Sri Lanka , with which several social media platforms are fully exhau@@ sted , bring residents in need in security and aff@@ ection@@ ate aid measures .
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way up to the restoration of the norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March 21st , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
use Or@@ ig@@ t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor &apos;s love and love gir@@ l@@ friend .
I trust my four year old daughter , she tru@@ sts in me their children ; she is my rock in fire .
in one minute , we call par@@ ol@@ ises for the rights of women .
in the next turn we add rights for transaction .
we are located in a sea of Rainbow and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with head@@ band high , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ em@@ adding par@@ ol@@ es against Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my gir@@ l@@ friend looks forward to me , saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why am I not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I already have conducted these conversation .
people , with whom I work or people who have been working with me for years , split me - the Sah@@ ar which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their performance .
she mus@@ li@@ fy me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we will not see all the same .
we practi@@ cing our religion .
we identify to be a Muslim , in different art . but som@@ eh@@ ow , we are all plug@@ ged in the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well designed in our collective presentation such that as soon as Muslims who can &apos;t be un@@ cle@@ ated there .
de@@ pri@@ med are mis@@ ed
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even the po@@ ets , whose poetry is selling in America : Rum@@ i .
what images are a sense considering the sense if you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I was now , he was a orthodo@@ x mus@@ li@@ fic pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the western presentation , religion Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ etion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims from this world .
another exists in the reduc@@ tive images of Muslims , Western books have already colon@@ ized since centuries .
this cur@@ led image language is determined by the dark man that should fear and the exotic woman that you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid in the 1970s the history behind these pictures .
but these pictures are still ongoing today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood .
I have worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful and defective Nar@@ r@@ ative has dominated our news@@ feeds .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v exceeded the reality that brought nine Muslim women in the past three decades , while the US could not have their first female presidential candidate in the US in 2016 .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v f@@ ails to recogn@@ ise that if French , Muslim women are forced to carry out her head cloth at public buildings and Saudi Arabia , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same medal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exec@@ utes his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong Nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ens Muslim women , lead movements for change .
it sees , that the first Muslim Pra@@ yers were spoken to American territory of Afri@@ cans , who had been associated with slaves .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective pre@@ ference power in deep and faul@@ ty that often Sik@@ h men and children are to be an@@ tim@@ ely attacks and attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories , we tell and because of the species that we tell them is Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia today not only fear of Islam , the religion , but it is fear of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
belong to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we can do more than just stories , that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative who help us to understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has failed to capture the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1.7 billion dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have been failed here where seven million Muslims are the highest degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; Relig@@ ious group in America &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ Flemish Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the emig@@ rants of the first generation , which come from 77 countries .
the parents of the author 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid its first jewe@@ l design at 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; Wol@@ k@@ enk@@ r@@ atz@@ er were supported by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan thought the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ ted Muslims and Americans .
but am I now un@@ overcome Muslims and American ?
sometimes , if I ask people , why I don &apos;t eat pork meat , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes or take my hand@@ ker@@ ch@@ iefs , who carry all Muslims with respect - &quot; from respect to P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I sh@@ ear , we don &apos;t wear all T@@ asch@@ enk@@ or@@ ane with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also have to be a the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who are ti@@ cking @-@ wide popul@@ ations about Islam .
these lies will be produced on the current volume of a well @-@ treated Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ ists with money , Th@@ ink Tanks and experts for Fal@@ sch@@ information , which is our already faul@@ ty image , which is a Muslim ; or what Islam is , manip@@ ulated .
because of the stories that we tell and because of the species that we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is in more than just a foreig@@ ner who r@@ ash the head of a woman .
or as the terri@@ fying map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole United States , see below .

Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia in its aqu@@ eous forms affects our affili@@ ation .
it affects our identity , which is so far , so versatile and versatile , that it can be impossible to drawer in a drawer .

I want to explain that .
I was born as the Muslim but a Muslim was born only when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
if social scientist describe religious life , they look forward to the following terms : faith , Beh@@ avi@@ or and Shar@@ es .
my mus@@ li@@ fic faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there .
perhaps my gir@@ l@@ friend , my neigh@@ bor , will see my rock in the fire that I am Muslims if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air , could separate our houses .
she would see the all@@ ab@@ end@@ ous rit@@ ual with my daughter when I put them in my arms and her Arab verses to protect the cor@@ ps and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
I repeat every one of them for three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask therefore that they are protected from evil , evil , you can see and evil that you can &apos;t see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mus@@ li@@ fic faith is not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow .
the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins an icon in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters sometime in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging to my grand@@ mother &apos;s picture is the image of my grand@@ mother with her sisters , as they win a competition of the art of floral design in Kar@@ achi .
it &apos;s the picture of you that I close in this moment , when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings , a book with many book@@ marks , a book with an hundred and fourteen chapters , which can be almost everywhere .
Muslims means to be the Muslim that she said to me if I have a bad day .
the Muslim Brotherhood to be in it , as it has taught me to rel@@ ate me to God : Allah Mi@@ an , which God means , my only Lord .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a people who was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has founded a company with the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; British East Tim@@ ini@@ des @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it has a deep meaning , God to call my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the author 1987 with her grand@@ father .
use approved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rand@@ om means to grow and to hear that men should not cry , but at the same time , my beloved grand@@ father wept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Inter@@ ch@@ rin , while he writes books on modern Islam and beyond the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan was overcome by his family in the east of India , who did not close his arms in half a century .
belonging to know is that there are millions Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grand@@ father , were torn apart from col@@ oni@@ alists , who shared the Muslim world as at the risk of risk .
Muslims must be known to know that in the last two centuries of Europeans all up to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the history was subjected to a century over a Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time the grand@@ father of my grand@@ mother , a Swedish , fas@@ cist sub@@ jection of British Empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; from the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous &quot; when he introduced the first mosque in England .
even before there were aircraft , he travelled to more parts of the world as I ever was , preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion people go back into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ collap@@ sed history .
it means that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops that were over every continent apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tica , had been spread to Iraq , to ch@@ ase weapons of mass destruction that exist .
it means to know that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the waste of the war .
an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate under veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means that if a tragedy bears the United States , and the susp@@ ects carries a Muslim name , the story four times more than a story with a white attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a delivered black slaves with the name Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago , a African Islam@@ ist Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad and was brought into this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat that I feel , when people filled the airports to fight against Muslim ban .
it is hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and if we &apos;re talking about black lives .
a American woman , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim and a journalist , the in@@ firm@@ ity inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our with multiple con@@ jun@@ c@@ tive ident@@ ities , but to fail to fail them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube , but will be represented in the reduced branches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother to be my child , and all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that ma@@ cht@@ ful and privileg@@ ed individuals created on this bi@@ dity to structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia consists in the Muslim Regist@@ ra@@ atures , which began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it is in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration officials , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it consists in a country that covers its borders against people from just the countries that bom@@ bed them .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which takes largely Arab@@ s and Muslims .
they are the wars which we carry and cast the bombs which we cast on Muslim countries .
due to the stories that we tell and because of those who we don &apos;t tell , we are today here .
in a study with the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western University participants showed a scientifically real image and desired them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation which we must lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are deeply dar@@ kened to the Muslim or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we look back to recognize the roots of our fears and the f@@ law@@ less and dangerous expres@@ sions that we are inter@@ fer@@ ed in our news editorial staff .
at least , there is a growing movement , headed by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our varied ident@@ ities and forgotten history .
the po@@ d@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Say Som@@ e@@ thing by Bu@@ zz@@ ler ; the vir@@ al vide@@ os@@ erie Secret Li@@ ves of Alt@@ itude ; P@@ ust@@ le Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative of print Muslim authors , Muslim , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim @-@ life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global point of time where we are located .
and this moment has consequences resulting in excess of 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that con@@ spiracy the@@ or@@ ists that existed in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House now lead .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally since they have made Muslims with &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally , having created the &quot; other &quot; .
a few years ago it had not given it yet ; now they rule large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am wor@@ ried about the re@@ alities and history , which I wasn &apos;t aware of when I was so old , as it is now my daughter , but I have made me today to an unknown Muslim .
things I have left here as a bread cr@@ ises in my speech .
things that may be rec@@ olle@@ ctions , because in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity is able to l@@ ur@@ king a story where someone is made to one &quot; others . &quot;
just now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations will be held in the context of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
more than hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; others , &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American milit@@ ar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are no terms , with which we usually t@@ oss us in our schools or read we in our newspapers .
poster of the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia Network .
we all have to ask ourselves , why ?
why I tell this at this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led to war and people through the work of the &quot; others &quot; in public performance , four decades ago .
we have to set ourselves un@@ comfortable questions after the role of whose , consci@@ ously and un@@ aware the &quot; other &quot; ; as it was my gir@@ l@@ friend and I live in rain during the Women &apos;s March , while we had no president , the chocolate cake and &quot; to others &quot; people are bom@@ bed , far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for Er@@ t@@ una wants to preserve urban lingu@@ istic diversity
statistics count , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Daniele Rossi , under the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility to enter here and now despite a language barrier with som@@ ebody in connection ?
for Steven Bird and Ro@@ by@@ n Perry , founder of the Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling Initiative ( T@@ LS ) , is the count of stories in their original language a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently over a new initiative by Steven Bird , the In@@ aug@@ ur@@ able Blog .
here , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but in the spoken word . this is an attempt to get language variety of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in the United States , where T@@ LS has already been carried out since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not given to the native children .
for the makers of the project :
the mass mortality of the world can be avoided , if we do cities ensure di@@ spar@@ ity - safe spaces , in which inhabitants must not forget to belong to them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to what often is connected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; list@@ ens to appreciate , to make . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers create their history first in their own language and translate or tell them in English .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their dev@@ otion , and the representation of the fact that the list@@ eners were inter@@ viewed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call laughter and emot@@ ions , unless the language is no longer a barrier .
for example , the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou consul@@ ates also the opportunity to clari@@ fy the land of typical customs of war .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the fork from the bun@@ ni@@ es and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after having declared the importance of his ring , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that your language does not understand ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a broad Gr@@ in@@ sen , he divi@@ des his feeling of in@@ comprehen@@ si@@ vity : &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have heard !
they were atten@@ tive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of the Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and the organ@@ izers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can be organ@@ ise with T@@ LS in order to organize their own levels .
Puerto Rico requested by the USA Re@@ placement of the State School
the aim of a re @-@ audit of the public debt of Puerto Rico , who participated in some 72 million US dollars , participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the march started with the Canadian Capit@@ ol , the capital building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was proclaimed by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la audit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( civil front for the ne@@ ural exam of debt ) and the Ö@@ kom@@ en@@ ical Church in Puerto Ric@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the advoc@@ ate of the debts of the debts have submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is your claim :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Puerto Ric@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is required that the politicians , banks and government agencies , responsible for the debt , responsible for their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial examination and a tap committee without personal interests in the public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions , in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will press and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os refused to pay an fault that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be found with sin@@ king pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the territory of an territory built in the United States - suffering from a severe financial crisis .
thus , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit organization &apos;s non @-@ profit organization with focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to existing national recognition .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the outside the measures are without the participation and convic@@ tion of the people are risk to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration took the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , organised in Berlin , devoted an event to the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ l@@ anie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist who manufactures in France based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director at Book Cost of Freedom at Book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Inqu@@ iry ( The Cost@@ s of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Research ) .
the book which was published last year and is licensed here , includes a number of attach@@ ments which deal with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction there is :
this book wants to educ@@ ate how to create movements for free knowledge and what are the true cost , with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , engineers , researchers and authors , involved in the movements of free knowledge , have been working on page to view over the fog , who gives our news@@ feeds and create something sense of our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was kn@@ itted from the directory of the A@@ dra pris@@ ons in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current condition or stay .
the introductory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that wanted to release his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel has paid a high price for his participation in a free culture , has to begin many of us to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ates , actions and decisions .
why are we now here ?
what did we decide ?
what have we abandoned in this process from time @-@ time extreme belie@@ fs ?
since March 2012 , the web@@ developer of Open Source and digital activity has been detained by Syrian government agencies .
in October 2015 Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military installation , to an unknown location .
his wife , writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police on the basis of a &quot; strictly ge@@ heim &quot; had taken prisoner of the military court of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that it was cont@@ acted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who then presented themselves as a Insider of the Assad government and asked them of an alleged death sentence against their husband .
his residence and condition remain still unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a decisive role in it to expand access to the Internet and to know the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and currently super@@ v@@ ise the lad@@ der of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that formed Bas@@ sel , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of the bass @-@ cultural prototypes , perhaps , was a work that he began to work with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually design the ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civ@@ il@@ izations and are mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with hi@@ es@@ ful traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ sel was not yet able to know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would set everything that architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but the world em@@ bodies .
this stra@@ pping into the digital archae@@ ology and the preservation has created a time capsule which will be to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of un@@ inv@@ alu@@ able value .
trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel could not conclu@@ de this project until now .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life to dream of freedom and Bas@@ sel taught me to embra@@ ce her .
I was overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English by , even when he was already in prison .
I have learned to read and speak English to speak English .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he always has his knowledge with everyone , who asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has taught others to read , write and speak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bas@@ sel opened me the gateway to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smart phones .
he brought me the internet .
he also brought others to others , as they are using computer , at least theore@@ tically , without knowing that they actually held in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a pro@@ sab@@ ot@@ ary , which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was imprisoned in prison .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for a year .
she tast@@ es the lyrics of him when she visited him , and translated them from the Syrian in English .
the book is licensed free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ sef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is a excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It happens : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens every visit ,
that in the world I dist@@ illed in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes ,
that I lose the owner in the moment , in which we embra@@ ce us ,
that one of the dangers is equal to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , fet@@ ters and gu@@ ards
I forget the pris@@ ons of the prison
and I go to every detail of your voice and words ,
that I do with passion for me ,
if your eyes fail to say
and I will send another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to recover all the moments ,
and to weep and smile on your absence .
I create myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the arrest of Bas@@ sel , G@@ ha@@ zi wrote :

bass history is not unique in Syria .
according to the Syrian network for Human Rights ( Syrian network for Human Rights ) since the beginning of the protests in 2011 , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared .
those who have been arrested or executed under violence through the regime , were tor@@ tured or executed .
by 2016 , according to the International Human Rights Organisation , Am@@ nesty International died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in prison since 2011 .
the stories of many other people are unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community calls for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
we repeat our demand in hope we must do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambique : due to corruption corruption and dis@@ mis@@ sal back to previous post
the Mozambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption of corruption in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus at which the corruption has been committed .
this is a Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , which was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison for a serious disper@@ sion of 54 million met@@ ic@@ al ( about 800 000 Euro ) for 22 years .
the money came from public funds at the airports of Mozambique , whose council Cam@@ b@@ aza was from 2005 to 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for good guidance and demanded immediately his re@@ setting into the company , what happened on April 19 then .
in accordance with a statement by the General Pro@@ sec@@ ution of the Republic , which granted the request , there was no obst@@ acle course for Cam@@ b@@ aza , back to its old position , as the company had no discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ act after his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants have not called the action .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Bu@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , shortly C@@ IP ) , a local institution that sets itself for public transparency , condemned in an interview with the German wave the decision of the company to re@@ define the director :
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step in terms of the efforts of our legal system , so C@@ IP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we have knowledge , that the company should have a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ act process against the in@@ corrup@@ tible would have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company was silent , however , and caused no appropriate legal steps to use the respective functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the mos@@ aic social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; resist@@ ible &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent type , he would have been a consultant after he was sentenced to one prison sentence and half of which have eaten half .
he could have paid lectures and motiv@@ ating words , he could consult and his image polishing .
but since he is in@@ competent , it has dist@@ illed to be re@@ integrated into the company which he helped damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is like to be paid for his silence .
re@@ spir@@ atory !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil says the director knows no mor@@ als :
the state of Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the State because he didn &apos;t believe him , that someone has been rewarded to such a massi@@ vely in such manner as well .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ ality to return and serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but only served only on the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was used to state the state , when hand@@ leb@@ ars used to get an exhau@@ st@@ ible money source and state itself , this man became tired , the previously loaded and finally sentenced to a long sentence .
hon@@ est , I don &apos;t know why this guy was rewarded .
Fran@@ ce@@ y Ze@@ ú@@ te , it preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el that a thief belongs to the prison :
th@@ ieves do not belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el the Mozambique will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , sl@@ itting and - by saying - proph@@ etic Red@@ ner .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was , when he affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious man was to be able to sell his own individual interest , to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious man change that my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tics , but he doesn &apos;t turn from his amb@@ itions .
an ambitious man is a crime . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also rejected :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat down for 10 years and came free .
and today it sets him the company , at which he re@@ tre@@ ute the contract , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Hem@@ p &apos;s First Command@@ ant ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12th , 2017

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or mol@@ ars .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known Social Network expanded its postal order from the net , because they ab@@ stain@@ ed the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although it is still discus@@ sing the source of the word , it is normally used to refer to people east Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ jec@@ tively . &quot;
Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or it . it was a part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate crimes in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the asc@@ ension of radical nation@@ alist movements was given an extremely ab@@ brevi@@ ated loan .
in particular , it is a word that mostly used for ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as an event of hate Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in the effort , hate in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of practical content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism in connection with rac@@ ism , but the word does not call themselves from Hass@@ elt .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that , in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed in doubt for the purpose of its use , cen@@ sored .
there are several bur@@ m@@ ese words with fundamental different mean@@ ings that have the same accounting sequence like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , stool is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ ell@@ b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kne@@ aded A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at declared the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the Word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a spiritual way , whether they could w@@ anting to lin@@ ch his back pain , by making a word game .
the set ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question@@ er ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ AD is the opinion that , in Hass@@ am@@ ical , radical nation@@ alists , however , stressed that Facebook analy@@ tic would be di@@ vin@@ ation before it del@@ eting all the Post@@ s that tries to spread R@@ ass@@ ismus in suspic@@ ion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it automatically filters the word .
the Autom@@ ism will not understand what you can write to fac@@ tions .
what it should do instead , to analy@@ ze the post carefully and check it by using the same words .
for example , Kal@@ ar Ht@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( Sp@@ ell b@@ sen ) .
the good thing is that this dre@@ ad@@ ly nation@@ alists , the Hass@@ ler spread , a rather good lesson .
now it is time to circum@@ cise its nation@@ alism .
while the promotion has a strong signal to everyone , the hate language may spread , the efficiency of this strategy may not be long .
the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proved that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often have a cat and mouse game , whereby the users can simply start social networks , a new word or alternative writing of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author of A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described as Facebook began to delete his post@@ s when he would only communicate his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... when I was atten@@ tive to this new guideline of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is blo@@ cked .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and me , the li@@ ken , post and share of Content for 24 hours is prohibited because the post &quot; Facebook community standards did not escape . &quot;
Facebook has a great number of Post@@ s from people who have no negative inten@@ tions or that simply try to show their opinions against the Hass@@ elt radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed , who has nothing to do with hate language :
post without Hass@@ elt from Facebook .
in the post , the author told his opinion , why extreme nation@@ alism and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism are po@@ or@@ ly po@@ or@@ ly in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more on the beginning of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asked for advice :
Facebook may have a beneficial intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work .
such words will be cen@@ sored only more hat@@ red within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems to be allowed to have this without a local context or technical support , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inheritance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ sen@@ curr@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found that they have made mist@@ akes , they didn &apos;t try to report the actual postal order .
if only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits would have a great turnover , that would be great .
Fac@@ eb@@ ooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ able has provided for a lot of fun among the users .
instead of serious , users can now take advantage over Facebook and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ elt to see if their Post@@ s will be taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook Post@@ s , which were not found in Hass@@ language , but nevertheless removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to eat and watch an Indian film on a chair and watch an Indian film .
just in order to try whether Facebook contains the post , which contains the Word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , you will heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alists , social networks have used to expand their voices and their impact .
among other things , hate and social networks in the community should be in addition to the municipalities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine territory , where con@@ front@@ ations between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced to escape .
on Facebook , Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to have critic@@ ised Hass@@ elt to his bur@@ s@@ enti@@ cular pages under control .
but rather than simply f@@ ailing the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better been better to see context than on the code of concentrated initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago has finished with the children
a wedding ring in sand .

children &apos;s children are illegal in Trinidad and Tobago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanimously decided to offer a law which is to offer this practice , so that the married age is now at 18 .
before this change in the event of marriage , some members agreed on the practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mah@@ ar@@ aj , who was gathered together to a large public lift . then , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mah@@ ar@@ aj , who was gathered to a group of religious groups in the country , that the state would not inter@@ mix , because that , age not the maturity . &quot;
this was important to the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN &apos;s legal agreement , a minority interest than , every man under 18 years of age . &quot;
statistics for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who have already been married to 15 percent in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the statistical Central Bureau of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media mot@@ ions , den@@ oun@@ cing laws on the children , followed by the foot and rejoiced with great support . und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly , they call this result .
nevertheless , it was not all smooth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du @-@ leader , for example , had no concerns , to say the critics of the children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are dam@@ ned to worry about their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition kept for ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and sometime , doub@@ ts came on whether to agree with the opposition to the bill .
but early in 2017 , the bill was decided against the children before - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the Opposition and an independent , which was discussed , so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where already a simple majority would take him to the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the President of the country has to vote and announce the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a Status update to Facebook once again , Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill of bill before the child was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes against and no one only decided .
in the Senate , after having been decided in the Senate , the draft will now be implemented .
the majority of social media users were thr@@ illed because the laws about the children &apos;s children were finally changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook Member Lov@@ ell Francis &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Minister of Minist@@ ery in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has too much time and unnecessary Ger@@ ede , which has veil@@ ed the core of the thing , but you know what ? the children &apos;s child is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago in Trinidad and Tobago is worth it almost every prize .
during Abel Jackson &apos;s opinion , it was definitely long enough to do the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas over@@ looked that the day was finally come :
public Status Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Excellent news !
the marriage set has been approved .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for this - 0 ! ! ! !
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group , which said openly about how important the adoption of the law was noted :
the married age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft for the change in marriage was adopted today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives , 35 of them were present at the vote .
all members who were contrary to the law have agreed for the law .
the children &apos;s children are legally allowed in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ r@@ s@@ ild@@ hood .
many thanks to all activists who have pronoun@@ ced him .
congratulations to congratulations .
a thanks to our M@@ EP@@ s .
but a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ organization of the country .
before months , Mah@@ ar@@ aj wrote his intention to do judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to be able to redeem his promises .
while the General At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ At@@ tor@@ ney Paris Al ra@@ wi , a supp@@ orter of the law said it would be quite just@@ ly if Mah@@ ar@@ aj was going against the law , most of the social media users would wish to make the debate on the subject .
Patri@@ cia Wor@@ rell proposed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; better Sat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we take instead of the discussion in a way that only pan@@ ic and ir@@ m@@ wood can make sure that the state , our daughters that they might believe that they might be mis@@ used , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would you be willing to mis@@ use them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would you be willing to continue the discussion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
but if it &apos;s now to a court approach against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s children are legal or still remains the norm , although there are laws , which they say .

with the mirror of websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
on 18 January 2012 , the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was en@@ dowed with the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA Copyright Act .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than one month , Turkey has now been the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
day for day is more significant how important the platform is for users to find helpful staff as well as reliable information .
both students as well as repor@@ ters and fans of TV @-@ series watches themselves against the sperm .
although many techniques are used , Internet users are used to use locking tools for blocking websites ( a current article from the New York Times that Turkey has the third largest VPN preval@@ ence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been published articles from Wikipedia , as recently as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , will find regular blocking of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most important country in the world when it goes around the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , there are now several Mir@@ ror@@ Pages ( pages , reflected the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain name and thus making a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the content is activated despite legal prohibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a blo@@ g@@ ger IP@@ FS reported about his efforts :
after we have heard the messages ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we were able to complete everything , snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the opportunity to read the contents on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed ways .
this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if it can &apos;t reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ es org .
IP@@ FS also demonstrated that this step was done independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it just was screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the sperm .
Crist@@ ian Con@@ sunny from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ kno@@ pe@@ di@@ .org , a mir@@ ror@@ side of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to do similar mir@@ ror@@ sides , when in the respective country Wikipedia is brought forth .
Con@@ sol@@ i reported sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ir@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices , as well as employees at Mozilla at the Pan@@ ig@@ ir@@ i &apos;s Open &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror .
if one gets to another URL , which is not the original . that what you can see is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server will continue on the right Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are blo@@ cked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server , which is not in Turkey .

I am troubled at home , when I suddenly called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River was a Leopard .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes from the tourist resort Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I went off with my camera and I was there in a few minutes .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the Leopard , and I immediately started to kne@@ eling pictures ! !
S@@ USS aims to obtain a collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition of Nep@@ al@@ gic nature and would like to make it a good understanding that wild animals are not so fur@@ ious , as they look like .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he should know it , for he stood still from face to face to face , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a tiger can not distur@@ b from the mind of sheep in sleep ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
I was also because of the darkness in the way to the home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ he@@ k appeared . he immediately falls , we see and star@@ red me through the Sal @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , S@@ USS placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ as nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and lived in a tent at the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India .
a revised version was re @-@ published here as part of a content sharing Convention .
in many parts of India , women with greatest care is to discuss the names of their hus@@ bands or even by older men in the family .
instead , they use a Pr@@ onom@@ en or tell the father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ end@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women that they should respect the husband of the husband , as well as fear of the consequences , they should consider the norm .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced from the Indian State of O@@ di@@ a by a pseud@@ o court and re@@ ject by her family and the village community after they had demanded a married relatives with name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tradition of her wives are not common in the name , is also common among men . however , they have much less access to fear if ever , they should not follow these practice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health staff , and ma@@ ids , a unique club , and were thus quickly became the main meeting of the city .
there is a place only for them alone , in which they discuss the host@@ ility of the patri@@ arch@@ ate and discuss .
as one of 56 clubs , which exists in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and is involved in the dismant@@ ling of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera to the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s up to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS patients , and guides this club .
they reported how this club created a safe place for this women and made them at the same time at the ambassador of the mur@@ al .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion round , made women who call their hus@@ bands by name .
it has decided on this topic because they wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem where women can easily identify themselves .
not according to the names of their hus@@ bands , it is a fire that pleaded not guilty to all the obligations and have never been question@@ ed .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition test@@ i@@ fies that a woman respec@@ ts her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t hold this will be regarded as a her@@ list@@ ened , as woman without Mor@@ al .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never made ourselves up to that discussion round .
at the beginning of the Roh@@ ini , the husband , who had never called her husband , had never tried to try at home at home .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother in law and my husband still weigh long after the video was at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me , and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I should call it from now on his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in Bag@@ gage , Roh@@ ini started its first discussion group .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it would be a good thing , because it meant the younger members of a family , especially girls and women .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women tried to bring discussion with an exercise in motion .
Roh@@ ini requested each participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , anno@@ ys , sad@@ ly , lov@@ ingly , aff@@ ection@@ ately and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then they asked them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot say the name of our hus@@ bands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; But they can call us as they want , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does that they have not respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equivalent to it ? &quot;
&quot; some of those women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom she brought the name of her hus@@ bands on lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , in which women married women the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so sh@@ y that , during the whole exercise , they did not go ahead . another decided to leave the whole inc@@ enti@@ ful fru@@ str@@ ation against him and his family until they cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ek@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the A@@ dr@@ en@@ al @-@ fr@@ enz@@ y , with an ancient fires broke , the women decided that they were actually trying to call their hus@@ bands in the name .
and they kept their word .
in the next days , Roh@@ ini received a number of reports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the husband of a wife called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put on women in the head , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his wife could not cease to say his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ mother murdered her , she got afraid , and told that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini meant , I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant in violence was less under@@ stand@@ able and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women tries to stop other practices , such as the example of the zin@@ no@@ red score on the fore@@ head , which shows the Eh@@ est@@ status :
why must only women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would bear the zin@@ no@@ red point when he was doing it .
he laugh@@ ed only and I list@@ ened to bear him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other women have not heard complete , but I think they are now in a better position to choose from it on some days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for many women , the discussion group is a saf@@ er place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we make an excursion on each discussion .
usually we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to make sure that women could do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says they . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with Cake ; they d@@ anced and sang and spoke about things that they had never made .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working for so many years to these problems and yet , I also have more about some things , such as our ident@@ ities are linked to our hus@@ bands , never as hon@@ est .
it feels great to say that certain things can say , quite no matter how small it occurs .
in a discussion round we have under@@ lined ourselves on the concept of honor and is connected to the clothes .
some women in the group have been born only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
most of them is okay , but some wanted to bear a oint@@ ment @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt on a tro@@ users ; they didn &apos;t have .
after much argument and discussion about the advantages of the own coat @-@ selection , the mor@@ als associated with Sar@@ is and much more , tast@@ es its own pair of Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ shirt ) in a discussion round , so that women could carry them .
next , they now decided to plan to plan a trip to Go@@ a where you can wear Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they will create it .
on the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion lu@@ b have changed something , Roh@@ ini confirms that things get slowly into the roll :
we have made only little steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then heard it again to say the name of her husband .
some , me not included , but only if they are alone and not other family members .
only one or two will continue to write the names of their hus@@ bands ; one or two women now bear interest rates at any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their fore@@ head .
the women in discussion lu@@ b know that the changes that they would like to reach them in their lives - like the F@@ eil@@ ing to be more freedom of movement or your own clothes choice - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
to give each other self @-@ confidence , realis@@ ing them that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a Vic@@ tims of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives everyone of us the hope that something is changing .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if every woman goes home to the club and other people , what we speak and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered to be the decline in Japanese culture of post @-@ war era .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who was exclusively inter@@ viewed by the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 at the 50th anniversary of the first visit :

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably recently been made .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published in the framework of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sidents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention in the international community after his advoc@@ ate had been announced at the end of June that he was hosp@@ ital@@ ized due to liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( stat@@ u@@ per@@ ation ) , after becoming a manifest@@ o on the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o which calls for democratic reforms in China .
he received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it is a speaker , he counted it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , China continues to receive calls from the international community , Nobel Prize Lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , allowing him to allow for a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the Pacific in Beijing , others are completely destroyed .
Hong Kong Free Press has consolidated some reactions from abroad .
United Nations , United Nations
en@@ vy R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the fall of Li@@ u .
however , a actors rejected it if the United Nations should execute pressure to help Li@@ u abroad for the treatment of Li@@ u .
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway went into Sto@@ cks after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government did not agree with the decision .
diplomatic relations continued only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to join the sal@@ mon into China , since the exports were largely blo@@ cked since 2010 .
after the news that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to un@@ conditional release , and invited Li@@ u to get his prize in Oslo .
due to his detention , he was not able to get off his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a decision to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
in a statement on June 30 , China , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , the leader of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called for his release in a statement on June 30 :
we are expecting to raise all the restrictions on Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members .

a spokesperson for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AFP on June 27th , that the embassy sought to release the Chinese authorities , not only Li@@ u free , but also his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US Embassy moved from China to itself , with the Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to make themselves together and in@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple of the following :
protection and freedom , such as itiner@@ aries and access to the medical care of its choice , which are entitled to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Rub@@ io , Jeff Mercury and Ted Cruz have introduced a decision in the Congress to penet@@ rate the Chinese government to penet@@ rate the Chinese government , Li@@ u and his wife .

Mc@@ Call@@ um tells further :
Canada calls on China to support his international human rights violations , including freedom of expression , to maintain true and the exercise of these rights for the exercise of these rights .

I felt personally very moving and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed for democracy , freedom and law of law in China .
Singapore : city or Country ?

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may appear du@@ mm , since Singapore is recognized as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , Singapore should be considered a city .
this re@@ mark has caused a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State Association of New York , the minister noted that many people critic@@ ized the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because they compared Singapore with other countries .
supp@@ ose that Singapore should be regarded as a city .
... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy ...
it is , whereby most people go an error .
I tried to explain that we may be different .
we are a city .
we are no country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to turn to the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , according to all our efforts and offerings to create this valuable land , we hear that we finally don &apos;t have any country .
it is that volcan@@ ic , it had the form of a flight before the responsibilities , a mandatory breach .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it ?
the reasons of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very Nobel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of whose , it appeared un@@ certain un@@ democratic .
however , however , he def@@ ended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the River Th@@ as , again the good old Lei@@ er from the author@@ itarian pi@@ th@@ ern to be put forward , leaving logic , because it fits better to their power .
in the final effect , in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , answers to his American guests , regarding our press , our J@@ udi@@ k@@ ative , our political system truly non @-@ Ans@@ wers .
the corresponding questions does not tar@@ te with non @-@ response r@@ ational manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am to illustr@@ ate his opinion , since they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally think it is a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so to which country belongs to our city ...
shortly , I understand nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be very grat@@ eful if our &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take on the effort to clari@@ fy this point , if he was highly paid to be part of the government of Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by decl@@ aring his commentary on the blog , he refers to the critics that you should begin to understand the entire title of the conference , so that you could understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am better , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was more a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as one country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared why the elections in Singapore had so un@@ satisfactory , even if we are looking for free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he moved to Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party to win a party ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously not in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who as leader of a her@@ b@@ ite generation , making such pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de that awaits me - be with them , or not , but this is a different thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I have doub@@ ts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes it right and aware of what he def@@ ended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek review cr@@ ush@@ es the weak@@ nesses of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ ams arguments :
did Lord Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; committed a mistake , &quot; or was it a friend spokes@@ man ?
when Singapore is not a country , we will only be considered independent and so@@ vereign state ?
if not , on which country are the so@@ vereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the government of the government , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am are of severe importance .
why do the Singap@@ ore@@ dom of their military service they defend only her city but not their country ?
who must pay our Prime Minister In@@ voices ?
what is the value of our pink identity ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
if the journal Journey of a Dec@@ ade is added to the utility that Singapore is and always a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this set seems to have a lot of Singap@@ ore@@ an ...
no one ever told that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country in particular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this is not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked for Kurz@@ eme his editors : what is the most disp@@ leased aspect of your residence or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of a continuous series , with rum@@ ors over certain parts of the world and will be shown to another fac@@ et .
the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question that is most asked to me in Japan is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you American ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m coming from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live in Japan since 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation the discussion takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his talk partner by providing personal questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on my clari@@ fication , usually the default response is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Canadi@@ ans are perhaps to cook for an American but anno@@ ying me this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that the Canadian of Americans differs from American .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans make a Canadian flag clearly visible on their back@@ pack if they are travelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all dear Canadian .
Americans on the other hand ... .
so it was already , when I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before entering Iraq and before September 11 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canadi@@ ans have always carried a small map@@ le sheets on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neigh@@ bors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have a free healthcare !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ gender don@@ ors have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exc@@ use &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is also regarded as the toler@@ able land towards ethnic groups .
we are not as such as these types south of the border .
we Canadian are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends who I ad@@ mi@@ red .
it would not account for myself , if one would change me for example with Johnny in Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first : as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that such as the good @-@ tired , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( which has an own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Canada would really be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would be a step forward . but the actual problem exists in it that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has .
there is no corners and edges , nothing , at which one can stum@@ ble .
harm@@ less , means un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting , and make no attention to earn .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , from the things that will happen around a round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would even go to say that the wish is to be free and alone to be the principal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canadian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to worry about our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is perhaps simply a cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadian did not speak often over the fence with neighbours .
I missing the warm , open kindness , which I have to connect to my American friends .
fortunately , for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Just@@ in Tru@@ de@@ au then entered the stage in order to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister has made us a sexy girl .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a music video in Thailand has released a music video which took the j@@ unta , which took power in 2014 and restore power in 2014 , despite its promises to restore civilian government .
the new song &quot; dict@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ ze Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about that rules making his gir@@ l@@ friend .
although not expressly polit@@ ically , the music video does not refer to the continuing military regime of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was given by many fans and other Internet users to describe their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video was dealt with a highly charged video 1,@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blo@@ cked in Thailand after a group of activists turned to the public .
it is possible to interpre@@ t the video as a creative and entert@@ aining introduction to Thai politics , in particular how it keeps the position of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
check out these videos of the video that rel@@ ate to some of the political issues related to Thailand in the last three years .
the &quot; 44 Rules of Girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical Section 44 of the provisional constitution which is given the commander of the army &apos;s lack of major national issues .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ ori@@ ous programme to the &quot; setting change &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are regarded as a critic .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime against , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear rules can often be used by the authorities to identify activists and other critics .
for this purpose , a new unit in the Army was also established to monitor the online content and people who are accused , will have prosec@@ uted the mon@@ archy to be prosec@@ uted .
Thailand sets a Stri@@ ped Ges@@ hur@@ ry against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ est &quot; ( Maj@@ esty ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , there was a coup of the army .
one of the problems that Jun@@ ta continue to buy the Jun@@ ta , their decision is to buy U @-@ boats , although safety experts were warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax loss .
in the video , it will be shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before they bring them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists sit in prison because they allegedly causes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened to off@@ end the mon@@ archy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the band members of the band , which was cited by Sal@@ ut &quot; Die tribute of Pan@@ em &quot; was already used by p@@ utsch opponents , during protests in the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost town in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri St@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and will be published here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society re@@ covers slowly in East Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ies , especially in the district T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has passed over 20 years now , since the ge@@ aring @-@ slo@@ ping war has been officially terminated , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages such as D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the fire basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Rus@@ sians , Greeks , depreciation @-@ Asia , Geor@@ gian and Armen@@ ians lived and worked in the area together .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the largest part of Rus@@ sians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases are living in the area .
such settlements are called gh@@ ost in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period there were more than 10.000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the population was 16,000 people after it had barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 about 43@@ ,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all is a result of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , called Ch@@ ru@@ sch@@ k@@ ow@@ kas are symbolic for the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are fallen and rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village of D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult to finish this .
&quot; this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , which served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with infl@@ ated spl@@ end@@ our buildings .
the people who lived in this place and contributed their contribution to the central planning industry of the Soviet Union in the meantime .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Ch@@ ru@@ sch@@ k@@ ow@@ kas , which can accommodate one or two families , they recognize the balconies where laundry is dried up .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they pull back immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Mother has forbidden us to photograph ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is just forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ per@@ ed to her gir@@ l@@ friend and suddenly leave the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people work in the area for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products ) such as cattle , be@@ eke@@ eping , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable stock .
it is difficult to come about the laps .
the district administration offers free candles and bread in the winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes &quot;
about ten years ago , an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as they called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to jung@@ le k@@ ha .
despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ ch@@ asia in order to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she tells her .
Gal@@ ina would not to accept any financial aid from her daughter , and har@@ med their young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly R@@ ente are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither have a sweet garden , it is very hard to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other vill@@ agers are trying to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she told her story , a younger neigh@@ bor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a to her . &quot; they said , we could build zu@@ cchini .
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one can get to everything &quot;
sprinkle with her husband and her five common children lived in her house for some time together with her husband and her five common children .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds on the village of Dor@@ mit@@ es in front of the war .
despite the relatives who live in central rus@@ sia , Oss@@ et@@ ia and Georgia ( the Land Ab@@ ch@@ asia broke off ) , they did not leave the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build there a house , but it will take a little bit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha is awarded for each child approximately $ 9 child money .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ ash@@ as Kindergarten came once , they hold pigs , cows , chick@@ ens and chick@@ ens .
it told that it was a very fri@@ gh@@ tening situation , when many people left the village after the war .
but during the time they lost their dist@@ resses .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , however , it was rather something to do with lo@@ oting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the war there was hardly any work , and all lived righ@@ tly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remind me of course , like the city and the war &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation lies at the end , a little boy passed away to us .
it runs through the windows of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball fly out of the window and another boy j@@ ump@@ ed to him .
he plays with the ball that rolls up the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them cast a stone on the falling buildings .
this ruins are a part of their childhood which ensure in@@ justice in their lives .
they do not know otherwise .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; was home to mig@@ rant in their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as at the border of Mexico at Guatemala .

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was released on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and will be published here with kind permission .
on the way of mig@@ rant who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located at the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is directed by a 59@@ th year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink Br@@ ill@@ en@@ frame and gold colored ear@@ rings in ted@@ dy form .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nickn@@ ame is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ kan@@ ers and Ha@@ iti@@ ans , who are on the passage .
the hotel has no charm .
for approximately $ 2.50 the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with grinding , slo@@ ping walls and beds made of metal .
in the entrance hall , there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the Hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Ha@@ iti@@ an migrants join here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells the people in full scale buses and off the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment , it is rather quiet but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cardboard .
she wants to refuse to refuse .
they also helps them , and bring them to the hospital if they are sick , they bu@@ ys them medicines that they can &apos;t pay them , they massage them with a bal@@ m who exhau@@ sted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , is arrived at a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable nickn@@ ame for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a jo@@ gh@@ ty person ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that there is very nice women because African women are very nice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very lov@@ ingly aff@@ ection@@ ately .
she has the heart of a mother ...
we feel very well here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels to Boston with his sister who hopes to return to Boston , to find out there their husband and three children .
they already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans , who are on the way into the United States , normally a first stop in South America and then move towards the north .
the family had heard from other way accompanying them by Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he told that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and the Afri@@ cans often travel to the route and that Afri@@ kaner is already talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
how many of his journey did Michel@@ et lived in Brazil , and worked as a construction worker in construction sites of the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weak@@ ened , he started his journey into the United States .
he has been guest in Mama Africa since months : it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ ju@@ ana .
I wonder if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we never let them go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answer he sm@@ iling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells us that their guests are often sending its often text when they continued to report them , or to report their journey over the course of their journey .
it explains that you be Christian faith of the drive of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have taught you to prepare chicken like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps well @-@ known , but it is not the only spar@@ ks hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a cu@@ l de sac leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family was included in this winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is polic@@ eman and has found that the Bust@@ ets are sold to a lot of African migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleeping on the ground , but at least they have electricity , washing machine and cooking outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what she experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was deported to a raid on his work place from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels across Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that in Honduras with his wife and his three children fled to people who wanted to press money without a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for a accommodation , and an unknown , a sole drawing , has offered him a roof .
a few months later , the family still lives and try to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests .
in the cor@@ rid@@ ors consume the traveler quiet@@ ly their phones .
a small bus has arrived today and has 20 new guests , most of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about that her house is full , but they are nost@@ al@@ gic , because of those who went away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she bl@@ oss@@ oms her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair bra@@ ids , which you made a customer , some photos of their grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and elderly .
she laugh@@ s sor@@ row@@ ful while she is briefly presented for me .
&quot; Ya &quot; fu@@ eron &quot; is repeated every time . &quot; they &apos;re already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their phone .
a check @-@ Point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users . it was an early ring .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minority region in the West of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ sp@@ y@@ on their phones .
on 10 July , the mobile users of the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of the City of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile phone , where she has to install the District government , a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web pur@@ ification &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message is said that the app will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but unfortunately , the authorities also use the app for more than combat terrorism .
according to a exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because it had been installed shortly after they had installed the app , news with a private party group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication of the police , the app will determine the sources and the distribution channels of terror@@ ists , along with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
the main feature is the blocking of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ users and Ph@@ ishing pages to make users atten@@ tive to you how much time they spend online , and to control the own home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can be used in a variety of course .
for example , the &quot; remote actors or even h@@ acker could be able to t@@ amp@@ er the home network of a person or steal it .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while the news about digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China are mostly concentrated on the experiences of users in the major cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , oppressed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme poverty and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ely Internet connection .
the media @-@ based media out@@ let &quot; images from the China &quot; ( b ) , the cen@@ sored news published in China , showed photos of a Check@@ point , at the polic@@ emen who had been random@@ ly checked if they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you arrive at a Check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they comp@@ elled people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by hand @-@ growth technology .
we are back back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from the Republic of China &quot; ( s ) , a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang @-@ Product description , from which highlighted that the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows OS and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers , computers and mobile phones are used in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang for electronic hand cells .
the Regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may possibly be a reaction to the instructions of the city council , to minim@@ ize the dissem@@ ination of illegal contents .
all government leaders , authorities and the party related facilities , including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office at the operation of their computer and communication equipment .
a current report of Freedom House , an US @-@ American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , a decree on all residents and entrepren@@ eurs , to register their &quot; personal ID cards , phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ eb@@ ooks , and media storage cards &quot; at local police .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intention is evi@@ d@@ ently to identify and destroy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this promotion , however , viol@@ ate the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives it pen@@ alties for a full range of other crimin@@ als , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
one single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo of : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the active is sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far away from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and stell@@ st that you are very close to a place where everything is important .
everything is dissolved after and dissolved , and reveals a truth that is clearly visible , both from inside and outside .
one who makes her name every honor .
one who finds itself in a list of feelings and supp@@ ress , which allow no met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if you look back the reality , and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - turn the characters in beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all the doubt dissolve in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is on the axis of the trouble . you will clear that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone was erected here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but this was not enough to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lesson learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the chief of the security services it formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he introduced his power over us by proof even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five te@@ ens were torn out during a peaceful protein in the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough to break the city the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the neighbour@@ hoods sought , only my own not .
for the first time it was still , reg@@ o@@ ily , to a wrong time , even if I set no high demands on a city , that is up@@ lifting up to the arter@@ ies with state security and their comp@@ lications .
in the third night , things had cal@@ ming down , after the power supply of the quarter had ceased functioning .
I crossed the silence , by I cried several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house @-@ roof .
I heard my voice through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt enough to gather together .
I was not alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many friends , true friends came to me , we ex@@ iled us to a beautiful image that fulfilled my expectations and all filled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in such a moment you know that you delivered the spirit from the lamp , but it is not interested in the rest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make you ready to meet us at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : how much honey you can swal@@ lowed up - nothing can return to you your voice , after you have made it all the way up to the office of security from the body .
I came there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear me , as you cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are crying out &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are cour@@ ageous enough to cry if we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
its h@@ asser@@ ate eyes rose up on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you do not trust what to look in your eyes , and do not trust in the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did , did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity : perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure , when I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think I never stopped to look at your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest conversation which had such fatal consequences for me , but I don &apos;t regre@@ t the word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in single , and his father equally with them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father equally with them . &quot;
the pro@@ sper@@ ity of this pro@@ w@@ ed proposition is up to me today in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an se@@ cular torture that I was exposed to monthly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cried to the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
thereafter again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a speed to the individual cells .
I contempl@@ ate all details exactly before I spent the room .
different than otherwise they have assigned a larger cell in this time .
I must share them with only one other prisoner , and must immediately place myself without their permission .
after a couple of minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell , and I fell back on a well @-@ proven communication method : with his f@@ ist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my bus@@ h@@ or was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; easy det@@ ain@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long time he answered me in the end .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells found a prestigious man middle age who looks similar to me and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the perfect darkness , there is no distinctive com@@ po@@ ets , and doctors there are not here ; we are all numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone , whose voice does like my sounds like my sounds ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all responses are connected to a existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells .
maybe he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had covered me , they would be glad when I stay .
Lü@@ g@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to distribute a bird @-@ birds in order to distribute all these cro@@ ws which lab@@ s in the garden of my head lab@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I hear it still &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black saw the color of the verb , until I saw the yellow light , which set us up in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Donn@@ er , &quot; calls on 13th S@@ ure des Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to stop . &quot;
this was the secret revealed : to protect the state security before us and prevent the terror@@ ists and the terror@@ ists , they speak in al@@ a@@ funny dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ essional record card and conf@@ essed the close view@@ point of their world view .
here is no house , this is no country ; it is a curse to whom it call Ko@@ exist@@ ence to trans@@ form the crimin@@ als of their cl@@ ans into a hero .
I cared about the audi@@ ble and tre@@ ach@@ ute at Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and st@@ em@@ blem@@ ish man ; at least it comes to me so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; con@@ sign@@ ation , despite the facial expres@@ sions that get to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My boy , you are still young , you can protest as far more important with your life than you to protest this day , so soon you &apos;ll find an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I answered not .
I have not acc@@ ust@@ omed to answer me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can really tell more exactly what kind of ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches after a friendly talk to me are become a ordinary communication &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when and how it happened , was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to be punished , or be punished , though I had done nothing to earn this punishment .
to punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to rip me as much as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; conf@@ ession &quot; .
it starts with a plastic tube , probably from the clo@@ aks .
your Hen@@ ker tru@@ sts in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you will not return your terr@@ ors .
my cry did not wor@@ ship@@ ed him enough , because they inter@@ changeable the pipe through a cable .
in my first arrest I asked if the investig@@ ator had been working as a gar@@ bage he@@ dges , or if it belonged to normal working equipment .
they had four cables attached to each other , to present us from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable .
within a single hour , three of them are rarely changed , while I still was still in row .
I have lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , why I list@@ ened to cry .
the Hen@@ ker noted the cooling down and found no pleasure in any case , which is why it is as a next to an electrically loaded rod .
electricity flow@@ ed my whole body , enough to supply my whole district .
my semi @-@ cra@@ cker body , which lay out on the ground , was the perfect current conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his obligation for this night .
that must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep back again ; let &apos;s say , that was my only option .
some hours forget that came to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning .
the door opens and the morning light meets the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am looking forward with the voice of a exhau@@ sted young people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet and keep away you , you will be transferred . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ bar@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression of expression and resistance
Em@@ bar@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ bar@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b gets the majority of its time inside ; times he moves to his screen , next to his computer , and again to his couch .
what one can rely on , is a cigarette between his fingers or his people with nicotine stain@@ ed lips .
he lives in the chief of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel had forced his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs were forced to escape from their village in Palestine , where she lived as fel@@ lows ( about : Farmer ) .
for now six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is an passionate active activ@@ ist , who has transferred the conservative majority mut@@ ing and their old proven opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression of opinion by art and rap@@ es@@ music .
with his music that deals with topics such as Orient@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian ge@@ pl@@ ough@@ ing , but also demands the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues will not only be found in Amman &apos;s home town , but also in cities , from Damascus to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as someone who is not restricted by borders , and he can feel according to their own statement with the people who have suffered under the devastating consequences of foreign inter@@ ventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he did not open it , he compl@@ ain about US American foreign policy , a special ascent .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in a studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b doesn &apos;t believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , anything that was to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian ge@@ aring of the second generation &quot; - as he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own living circumstances , &quot; emphas@@ ises H@@ d@@ ai@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he sm@@ ashed into two cups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . in this time it is fore@@ seen for Muslims from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moreover , the Jord@@ anian law also states that the consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ adan .
apparently , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for it to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ su@@ ous was called little with protest against Islam .
fundament@@ ally speaking the pieces of warm coffee and the buck@@ les of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky , especially if one raises a look into the neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan water - to do not work in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan published a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some parliamentary elections that support the Muslim Brotherhood - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front@@ al Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ dic@@ ts the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country and is the main reason for the concert .
in an interview with CNN , the dep@@ uties and former spokes@@ man of the Islamic Coalition DI@@ MA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN , said the concert &quot; just because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world may be dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m , which provides the old legitim@@ acy &apos;s author@@ itarian reg@@ imes in the entire region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a public statement issued M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supp@@ orters of human rights , &quot; which still decided to use for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not easy @-@ to @-@ be @-@ silk rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but actually a clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zed reality in Jordan is clearly reflected in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs work .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional sex standards in the body by which he formed his vision by the fate of Arab women , the vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex have formed .
the picture shows the Skel@@ eton of a apparently un@@ familiar woman whose arms and legs stretch back to the corners of the canvas .
she is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of in@@ numer@@ able women who lost their lives by the hands of those who should actually trust .
over the past few years in Jordan , the number of &quot; Hon@@ mor@@ ing &quot; has increased - the in@@ official outside left .
according to human Rights Watch , human Rights Watch reached its cli@@ max in 2016 ; however , Jordan was still missing that Jordan was missing the institutional infrastructure to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence to provide appropriate type .
according to a law for breaking control in 1954 , women who are exposed to danger of domestic family violence , &quot; and for their release , often an annual bureau@@ cr@@ atic expense as well as the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will not happen .
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs makes a great popularity and is known to be known as we are not afraid of themes as tab@@ lo@@ u in his country .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b suggests that his work is polit@@ ically , however , is that he is able to split his music that is full of exp@@ iry regarding sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of expression , cannot be split by politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was di@@ stra@@ ined politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; there is a focus on poverty .
the list of the songs that are polit@@ ically in the core of polit@@ ically .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is often repeated :
&quot; you are free , and any other is it too . &quot;
in the other course of the song , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , in which one can get what you want , &quot; - is faith or non @-@ believe , hetero@@ gen@@ e@@ ity or homosexu@@ ality .
he noticed that hardly any man speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans , and that comments for the gender equality of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were strongly cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b led an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an On@@ line@@ age program Ro@@ ya in order to note that his comments from context was torn , rot@@ ates and his opinion was cen@@ sored .
&quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded to Youtube without cuts , but only a modified version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b said openly for the Arab L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance against homosexu@@ als dis@@ agree with Islam .
he menti@@ ons Abu Nu@@ vo , a po@@ ets of the eighth century , who still remained in memory thanks to its hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : when Abu Nu@@ vo , which later should work on the order of the pot@@ assi@@ um , in the eighth century should write openly about homosexu@@ ality , why do Jord@@ an@@ ians cannot do this ?
the actual problem , such as H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , or the fact that the concert has been cancelled .
in the fas@@ cist kingdom there is nothing new , that the government is sanc@@ tion@@ ed to free expression , and that progressive votes will be put to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service held several former government officials and members of the teaching association , with the grounds that they had critic@@ ised their problems in social media , linked to the deeply in the country .
in view of what is the concert of H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs , only the top of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to work a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ier .
for him , progress is a representative and take . Jordan has promised a@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a now for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - so it sees H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - is of slow , afflic@@ tions and in@@ tra change . it is sure that these changes will be held in the heart of the Jord@@ anian Society .
finally , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arab@@ s also , from an Arab world without inter@@ ventions from abroad .
he dre@@ amed not only to bring his work until Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region , through music , art and literature , is a real and basic open@@ ness , and not through bombs , war@@ fare , and on artificial way to run demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least , he hopes it .
even so far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to continue and therefore resistance can also be resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these big , ex@@ travag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festivals .
it is thought that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many opponents . another theory has been delivered and come from one time , in the armies from the west of Japan in the Nor@@ theast , to for@@ cing the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , into the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could give us a few great seats , so we have a great view .
you can only imagine hard , how large these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital city , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again for long time : two pa@@ ge@@ ons are just visible .
nevertheless , for many people , who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival will be the only tru@@ e - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , external appearance and body care so important as in this history , because it help them to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from the crimin@@ ality and to promote a legitim@@ ate profession as the hair@@ dres@@ ser .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street rau@@ b and illegal drugs are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 was that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region should not feel certain .
at the same time , Peru - how many other food and South American countries - an increasing demand for men &apos;s aesthetic services .
the trend , the appearance , and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has resulted in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers to form the complex hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the ultimate borders of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event inspired by the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there are experts each other to show , who can create the ec@@ centric L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos about current competitions there is on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to discuss their weapons against hair@@ dres@@ ser tools and to obtain a training in the hair@@ dres@@ ser art , which makes it possible to find work .
motiv@@ ated by this activity and the potential opportunities , dozens of young people saw that they can sei@@ ze a profession , which is currently in fashion .
at the beginning of March , the school offered special educational workshops and reported about some of their achievements :
in 1995 we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud , because of love to the children we have built this education community .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the revised version of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; love messages to gu@@ err@@ illa strug@@ gles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contribution is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people who we know ?
is there not much more important , people who feel extinct , aff@@ ection the aff@@ ection ?
exactly this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activists of the Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os by the Young @-@ Youth Foundation ( letters to Re@@ conc@@ iliation ) , young people encouraged to write gu@@ err@@ illa fighters letters .
only before short , their country was the scene of a historical event , and they wanted to help their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace agreement with the gu@@ err@@ illa Movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was considered the sign@@ atory of the peace agreement as it was so important that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize .
however , in front of the colum@@ n@@ ern there is still a long way until one can speak of real conc@@ iliation and peace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ err@@ illa mur@@ ders who lived in illegal camps for many years were subjected to a war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and around the clock their weapons had to settle for the life as civilians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in turn , the Colom@@ bian society turn to life in perpet@@ ual fear and in some cases of deep hat@@ red compared to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , and now have to support them into their rows , and support them when creating a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian convinced that the young colum@@ n@@ ist would have to close together and help the integration process .
and exactly what did they do : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them again in society .
the Camp@@ a@@ ign of Camp@@ a@@ ign are 6@@ 900 letters - one of each former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who will then be handed over personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the Camp@@ a@@ ign
the idea for Re@@ conc@@ iliation was created at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize , who took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there were Leonardo and Crist@@ ian the opportunity to talk with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this stated that we love the people who love to write on Valentine &apos;s Day of thousands of love letters , but those who need to need them much more necessary .
he said he continued , in this year , he told his love with people who needed the most ur@@ gent pru@@ dent .
thus , the plan , letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , which now have to find their place in society and create a new life . &quot; the letters are ready to make the dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
up to date , more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ I never thought that someone would be forgiven &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art traveled into the camp to transfer the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC rely on how they had done earlier in order to meet the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no commands , but letters full of entrepren@@ eur@@ ial people from all over the country .
it was a very event@@ ual moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything that was between &quot; , telling the political science student Manuela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Govern@@ ors of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after having passed the letters , a former fighter hit by the camp of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ book &quot; ( a kind of hut , who live in the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who wrote something .
I was afraid to enter , because in addition to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ egran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the village .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi , what do they just do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will answer a letter which someone has written me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life , someone has something like something so nice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran my tears upon the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I embra@@ ced him completely , and set me beside the pom@@ egran@@ ate .
perhaps he was sorry for war , I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful fellow of this struggle , and to help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life as war . the F@@ ARC joined him , the only possibility to store him and his six brothers before the star@@ vation . &quot; I have never thought that someone would forgive myself for my mist@@ akes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now I know that there is a company without a society that awaits us with the open arms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now I have learned about how I have to handle weapons .
but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and dig@@ nity in dig@@ nity . &quot;
new voices
for the start of students , students and some of the F@@ ARC joined a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as war and the F@@ ARC already formed in secret .
therefore , the leader of the F@@ ARC the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views over the peace process : &quot; many years have experienced , how we have the opportunity to develop us to a political party , we can help us to promote the society in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this order , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
these people had never found but never found hearing , and know that people who have seen often seen as monsters , and even so hate people with beautiful poems , who were shot through their hab@@ itats and their environment , was very pain@@ ful for me .
the reality , where the country lives , is hurt to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it comfort me that all men , who killed and have done so much harm to us , and give us a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many former fighters have answers to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the arch@@ bishop of the city Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the column was made that after the dis@@ armament would rule peace .
but this is not the case .
as long as it gives in@@ equality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are prepared to hold weapons and protest@@ ing for their rights . this is also entirely justified ( ... ) .
we are at the F@@ ARC now on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call every def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ide@@ ology belong to them - to rise over all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , our contribution and bring victims , because we know of our own experience that nothing is simple . of those who defend itself as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be forth@@ coming .
on our way we will give it many obstacles , but we will overcome them together .

it follows the translation of an article , which was written by our partner A@@ ida Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ owa and its first publication on the OC Media website .
homosexu@@ als and qu@@ e@@ ere people who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a large bandwidth of haz@@ ards - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and fatigue .
with fear have experienced the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but the threat that depends like a D@@ amo@@ k value on the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q community , is not only about night .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of their experiences with us and talked with us about what has happened in the republic .
the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q &apos;s legal situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines after several months , after reports that the failure , torture and murder men were in the republic of them@@ atic areas .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ y Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , suspected men and took them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a transaction , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
she felt in her childhood for her childhood , she felt a woman in reality .
when she was growing , it was aware of that Che@@ chn@@ ya was not a safe place for it , so that they moved to Moscow .
after a group had learned from the sexual activity of their land@@ lady , hunting was opened on Sab@@ rina .
in fear of her life , she moved to the US last end .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day was told me that someone needed my help .
it was a messenger from Da@@ gest@@ an , a Trans@@ woman who put in difficulties .
she had no money , so I took them without delay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while I tried to help her , he thought a friend of my documents and spread them anywhere in the internet , with my phone number and a picture from me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there are no men more in Che@@ chn@@ ya , who can eliminate these shame ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made by all W@@ hat@@ s@@ app the round .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was just trying to get a few impressions from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned back , I felt anything in my body , but I did nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time I cri@@ mp : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you honor the family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t recognize the person .
I know only that there was a young man , no more than 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and the last end of the hospital was again .
apparently , some women had to get everything and scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two stit@@ ch in my right lung wings .
OC Media : in which hospitals were you laid - in whom are men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is still my male name ; but the physician got up and put me to the women .
for this I am very grat@@ eful to him .
when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got it with the fear ; it was a mus@@ li@@ fic , a Cau@@ cas@@ ian name .
but he turned himself as a good man .
I am grat@@ eful to him that he has respec@@ t@@ fully with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I got thre@@ ats .
they called me , and wrote me - relatives , stranger , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ life .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
they demanded that I would send me to Che@@ chn@@ ya , in order to prove that everything was a lie .
they set ab@@ sur@@ d demands : some said to me , I would prove it to prove it up without through the streets ; others wanted that I did not change my sex , that everything was just bad , and Photoshop .
I have a grain size C - what should I say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for them .
some older people spoke to my mother at the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the entire Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t touch you because you &apos;re a dev@@ out woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother was too much and she laid a snare around the neck .
the neighbours therefore came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window a car with dar@@ kened window discs and a number plate with a 95 windows .
after it happened for the third time , it was clear that there was something la@@ zy .
my human rights @-@ makers checked the number@@ ing boards - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how are you fled ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons , I don &apos;t want to give her name , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something unbelievable .
I still cannot realize how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought it , without registration , without identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw her into the gar@@ bage .
got on and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moment , when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ app , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe that you &apos;re in safety , just because you have left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people know , in which hotel you can use . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only in order to prove you : it is the number 115 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
this actually was my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about sexual activity , but this is a tobacco theme .
I always bear some traditional cas@@ ian elements in me .
so much i wish I to overcome this se@@ el@@ ic barrier can &apos;t be overcome .
I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to viol@@ ate them .
if we work with the camera , I actually give me effort to look like the person who reminds us of their past - so to my male shape .
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : know something about the current situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed ?
Sab@@ rina : I have submitted a report in Washington last week .
for whom I needed more information about the situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
I spoke with someone who fed into Ar@@ gun in one and a half months .
he told that during Ram@@ adan have no humans arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he completed a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that , I probably un@@ load the relations , they take care of the problem with the concerned person and in the end request a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has experienced by blood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : are now imprisoned in these secret places now ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says , it &apos;s not very many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or left out of their relatives have dropped to Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s court .
as far as I know , they will be held there , so that they can present later as terror@@ ists .
say : should they be slain , they will show their bodies in television and asser@@ t them to attack any village or military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply van@@ ished , but specifically under@@ di@@ pped themselves to re@@ loc@@ alize .
OC Media : is this now only a mut@@ ation or have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just hit someone who was one and a half month in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people had disappeared in this prison after their growth had grown .
there was nothing new of them .
they simply have taken away .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was not taken away when these people were taken away .
however , until now they were not introduced as band@@ its , there were yet no reports yet . however , we suggest that such actions are possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why should it not allow this man to sh@@ ave to sh@@ ave ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you know if this tra@@ ce@@ ability and de@@ duction of people who have a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already found in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always contributed my hair .
in Che@@ chn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I believe before 2003 I was already known throughout Gro@@ z@@ ny when I still lived there - and I never had problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria had applied , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much more secure than now .
Russia originally wanted to introduce ourselves to the &quot; civilian &quot; , but finally thrown us into the Stone Age .
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were f@@ aded , I had dy@@ ed lashes , carried out tube je@@ ans and short tail .
the Ministry of the Sh@@ aria has never seen me only a hair .
before the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met with me .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew it . they knew why men , young people met there .
we never were ins@@ ul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a spe@@ ech@@ ing : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; sp@@ otte is not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
they often say often to children , if they are talking about sick people .
OC Media : so did they simply shut up their eyes before you , because they believed you would be sick ?
Sab@@ rina : Yes .
they never ins@@ ul@@ ted me , never f@@ ails , and never struck .
OC Media : how long kept this Gn@@ ad@@ ens@@ ing time ?
Sab@@ rina : so long , to Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about Mor@@ al in television .
he spoke not over us by se , but above the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel like people in the city started to change .
those who had wa@@ ver@@ ed and prosp@@ ered , looked at once with suspic@@ ion .
in the time I left Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I was able to feel like the situation in the republic .
OC Media : which activities are you going to go after ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ iter .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the United States .
apart from that , I am still active as a activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I commun@@ iti@@ ers with them as a sort of psych@@ ologist .
we organize Te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , together , I gi@@ fted her to the hospital and help them to get food cards .
I have no p@@ enny for this .
I discovered those people themselves , when I flu@@ ked refuge .
I am Musli@@ ma and would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Cameron ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ ant .
so is the nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is exactly the same as the Che@@ chens who prophesied before you with foam in front of the mouth that there is no weakness in them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who have those who have Kab@@ ard@@ in@@ ers who have the Rus@@ sians have also known ; on the whole planet it is - but not in Che@@ chn@@ ya . &quot;
I am coming from there , so it &apos;s not pleasant to hear some kind .
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practi@@ cing Muslims who go into the mosque and fast@@ ed during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
know , many think of tran@@ sid@@ e@@ ity to men who love men , and they believe that man changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but this is a Tru@@ ste@@ er .
these are two different things - two different kinds of sens@@ es to be exact , different living settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin , and don &apos;t be ashamed for my body .
not if I don &apos;t have a partner or not .
do I &apos;m sorry that I am here so personally , but my last in@@ time relationship is already longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad about that - I don &apos;t know that I am now myself .
local groups were warned against an increase in self @-@ mor@@ nings within the pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suff@@ ers under an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate inside the native Arab population .
since the last months there is a strong increase in self @-@ mor@@ nings .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .

the self @-@ combustion of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on the 27th of August , the des@@ per@@ ate situation of the Arabian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Sou@@ thwest of Iran .
he suffered under anxi@@ ety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own help to get the in@@ ability to his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who are working in Ah@@ ra@@ z and anonymous .
a video on YouTube played the moments after he had already kindled himself .
some people were able to delete the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
the local sources according to local sources were so strong that doctors could have nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only self @-@ committed suicide in August , within the Arabian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists have warned about that more men could take the life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights told that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - executed this month .
their stories have one thing in common : there were all family v@@ ans who refused to pursue persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and unable to spend their families to nour@@ ish and safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , most of which is located in the Iran @-@ living Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community , was severely sh@@ aken by a pro@@ found economic crisis that makes it difficult to cross the native Arab population to conquer their hab@@ itat .
in front of a century , the Arab A@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi mon@@ archy took over power and received great efforts to finish the ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran in the next oil and gas fields as well as some of the most valuable and most valuable use areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite this valuable resources , the regional economy continues to grow slowly , and the native population gets only little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and emp@@ ties .
Iranian regime ref@@ uses A@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ Arab@@ s systematic jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government has also built a variety of dem@@ or@@ men , the water of the Arab areas into the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and Gh@@ om are to be moved .
these dem@@ umes have only led to destroy the devast@@ ation in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local agriculture and fish and palm trees .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi @-@ youths rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian director for cooperation , work and social welfare , told that 5 % of the ancestors of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who finished in primary school , completed 55 % a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , said Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment , and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; which leads to a &quot; high increase in the number of self @-@ mor@@ nings under the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Doh@@ im@@ i said that particularly unemployment is worse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ ra@@ z from the upcoming ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the officials and institutions pre@@ preferred the Arab labor force , the local Arab c@@ w@@ az@@ i will run access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic politics of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arab@@ s and to force her living outside of her home Ah@@ ra@@ z .
there are people who had to change their names and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the ancest@@ or so , because the Arab name will not be toler@@ ated , because the talking of the Arab language or Arabic clothing .
given the given circumstances that have to bear the Arab c@@ w@@ az@@ i , the human rights activ@@ ist , before the position of explo@@ sives .
it remains to wait if the world is awak@@ ening and having knowledge .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why don &apos;t I identify with the femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion that was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was object of several discussions in which many different positions were printed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
if I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who refer to themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ str@@ ating femin@@ ists .
you wonder why I am not part of the movement .
she even thought well thought scientific and social arguments from me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , women today still earn less money in spite of equal education .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that women are still under str@@ ingent observation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are doing so , what they are doing with her body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social nor@@ ms still ensure that women so@@ jour@@ n or later in various areas of life on a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on gender is still across the many different countries and belie@@ fs .
all this is aware and known .
I am convinced that I am sick of twice and twice among them .
I am a black woman .
and nonetheless , if I have to talk to skin color , on black C@@ is women , on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I say that we have been physi@@ cally affected by rac@@ ism and discrimination , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists have been abandoned .
however , all agree that women - all women should come together to raise &quot; their voices to &quot; their voices and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing the equality ( some ) of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t want to speak that it is in addition to sexu@@ alised violence an institution@@ alized form of assi@@ mil@@ ated violence , which we are exposed to black women on two times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or about that , black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ities and origin are less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background to the school are regarded as a white girl , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black sp@@ y@@ ars and women have been exposed to a higher risk to suffer from domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women .
in one hand , I want to have all the women , all the men , and at all the same rights , nor any skin of skin . on the other hand , I cannot consider myself as a black woman ; in whose centre the white woman is to consider , un@@ just to consider un@@ just to do justice in their mind as well as to the skin color of a person .
I &apos;m exhau@@ sted and I will not fight any more about my affili@@ ation in a white femin@@ ist @-@ orient@@ ated spre@@ aders that always refused me and rejected the other black women and always rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ eh@@ ner , in 1851 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am I no wife ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also feed myself , an ide@@ ology , in which the black woman in historical respec@@ ts a de@@ cent and mar@@ g@@ inal being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refused me to join group@@ ings , which also absor@@ b our customs and customs , in order to drive their eg@@ o@@ centric program .
I am not trying to establish white women to raise the importance of the cutting of skin and gender . since some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to honor them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different approach to benefit from the white femin@@ ism , still the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is still in its name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will draw it to resol@@ ve me full and completely from femin@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as wife , instead of me for a white femin@@ ist par@@ a@@ dig@@ m , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever , that we can define the black women to our own ideas and give us into the sphere , which will be created for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ an@@ ism ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism ) says that we can defend ourselves to our own kind . and not only that - black women can be hon@@ our@@ able in this way , in which the cultural , mental , se@@ el@@ ic , physical and even the spiritual elements can be hon@@ our@@ able , which make the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are immediately called separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion , after they have read these lines , I think about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contra@@ dictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift up black women and women from other cultures , because in this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m I exist .
I will be recognised as part of this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m due to my dark skin and my life as part of this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can bl@@ oss@@ om in a environment in which my life is neither deser@@ ted nor ig@@ no@@ red , nor rejected .
p@@ addle against pollution : the mission of a man who protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ b@@ old was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports in@@ special about international efforts to resol@@ ve environmental problems .
in the context of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again .
again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled to Nab@@ il Mus@@ a in the past 7 years - usually with a special offer by the Kurdistan region in Iraq . his mission aims to make the importance of clean waters of present and future generations .
in this documentation of Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of contamination to His church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to do something for the river we had lost than a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dust , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ ke@@ e@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ keeper Alliance - which works to protect &quot; rivers , streams and streams in Iraq , as well as local communities within the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of its work in a question : &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced for En@@ sia by Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq , based documentary film@@ making and multi@@ media journalist , filmed and published .

Paraguay : women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The weeping women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to express their pain on the women &apos;s mor@@ nings in the country and in the region and show her re@@ jection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; from Kur@@ dish . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # St@@ ich@@ ein@@ e@@ fr@@ au@@ am ) , who reports on violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed for the protection of persons affected .
a police officer said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , who had become a violent man who had been violent against violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since the end of her relationship had been past time and the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her testimony would be put to the files , but more could not do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a further wife Bal@@ sam@@ ena because of mist@@ re@@ ation , the acute display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was not useful .
a few days later , the second woman moved to her ad .
to break the devil against women , it is difficult .
in general , if women shall be reim@@ bur@@ sed at all , they do not receive any support by the State .
in many cases , women are also fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent of men , which they har@@ assed . this explains why only 20 % of all women to ad@@ mit victims of violence to be victims of violence at all .
in@@ lay 1 B@@ utt@@ ings and Statist@@ ical In@@ jection Meas@@ ures and a Legal system that nothing sub@@ ordin@@ ated 3 of the laws : good approach , faul@@ ty implementation s@@ lows and st@@ ats
it is difficult to determine how many women are really har@@ assed , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for Gen@@ der@@ eries in the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports that indicate the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; explained them .
but the above numbers are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , there were 9@@ 600 ads in the District Prosecutor of 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence . 70 % of them went round violence against women .
86 % of ads come from women .
there were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence in peace . here , 86 % of women came from women .
in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physi@@ cally har@@ assed , 55 % of women said from psychological abuse .
this statistics show not the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ard@@ i will actually be displayed only few of these stra@@ ins . &quot; on every woman who will not do in Paraguay for mental mist@@ re@@ count , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman who are reim@@ bur@@ sed for physical failure , two women who do not do this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as women &apos;s murder in Paraguay , no propri@@ etary criminal off@@ ences can not be appropri@@ ately documented , as many women are murdered by their current or former partners every year .
by August 2016 , journalists killed at least 12 cases of women in the country .
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator of Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , every ten days a woman dies due to violent crimes in Paraguay .

invisible mis@@ ery and a legal system that has nothing
before Mariana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z , the fixed gir@@ l@@ friend of Carlos Vera , was in@@ si@@ sted that she called his name of all their former friends .
but at the beginning it wanted not to do this , but then . however , it should always regre@@ t them .
today , Mariana is 28 years old and not with Carlos together . for two years she brought the psych@@ ic violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time most recogni@@ z@@ able :
I have never thought that I would be victims of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I have read previously read , I thought that only women happens to submit themselves to violent men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mariana used social media to report on the mist@@ re@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had isolated it .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic if he ever lifted up his hand against it , and refused to settle , that his behavior was also a form of abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other Facebook users asked Mariana , why they had fallen from Carlos and not left it before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it seemed almost like that they wanted to say that victims of mist@@ re@@ mun@@ eration had at least some alleg@@ ations about it .
Victoria Santos , which is not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner it har@@ assed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o C@@ RE@@ O Network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think you &quot; &quot; &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group , they can speak with others about their experiences to listen to each other and support each other .
they do that which many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ tor@@ ias case everything began with psychological abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your we@@ al@@ thy partner managed to convince her to convince her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ tor@@ ias ads with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , they received no support .
she led a trial against their former partners , who developed into an un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able judicial battle between Paraguay and its home country , mainly by money , power and the influence of their former partner .
Paraguay : good approach , defective implementation
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws , which are very good but not applied .
the display of mist@@ re@@ mun@@ eration is a way full of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen E@@ ch@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , looks great problems when applying the laws in the country .
on August 10 , 2016 , a bill was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , who became known among the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ El@@ las ( # Inter@@ read ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ im@@ a@@ Men@@ os movement ( # Non@@ In@@ e@@ Less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law looks like Fem@@ izi@@ d to explain and har@@ der criminal off@@ ences such as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
so the legislative text was changed in some points , in order to win the dep@@ uties for the law , so that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are currently forbidden in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill planned , most of the ( bureau@@ cr@@ atic and economic ) process cost , which have to bear the victims of violence to themselves , if they simply want to reim@@ bur@@ se yourself and maintain a safe accommodation to store the state .
E@@ ch@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not have sufficient financial resources for this purpose :
in Paraguay , mist@@ re@@ ation is seen as part of human relationships .
here one needs to take place , that violence doesn &apos;t have more than a little appearance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not keep silence in the face of these facts , he ple@@ ases and contributes to that the perpet@@ rators of the offen@@ ders come out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reim@@ bur@@ se so long ad to mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment no longer than normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the Act was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the Act had been changed . among other things , a passage was kn@@ itted , who called the partners in cases of domestic violence .
opinions on the changes go apart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the section regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor , its victims &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the string of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law is considered a big set@@ backs . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman a year exposed to prohibition of a newspaper still exposed to attacks
&quot; this website was locked in due to a decision of the Information Minister &quot; on the Homepage of the prohibited Newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
more than one year ago the om@@ an@@ an authorities made an independent Arab newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he was involved in prison .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , were also arrested and returned to court later .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power since 1970 when he had to power his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a state of state .
since then , he has been clothed in addition to his role as the sole Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the reign of Sult@@ ans is characterized by the har@@ sh efforts of security forces , especially of domestic liber@@ ties , including press freedom , restrictions and human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , B@@ logger and other activists .
the authorities restri@@ cts peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in the field of human rights , systematically activ@@ ates their opinions on the public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions for both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the detention three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for freedom of movement in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported on corruption in Oman ( an absolute mon@@ archy ) since its foundation in 2007 , until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , signed an article entitled &quot; high @-@ level parties bound hands of justice &quot; was published . in this way , corruption in the judicial system and the interference of high @-@ level officials accepted in court decisions .
in the report , government officials were accused of raising the judge of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a verdict in an inheritance .
issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ level parties bind hands of justice . &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , Member of the Edit@@ orial Committee , was invited by the ISS before the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS drew Chief Apostle You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who was appointed Chief Editor as Chief Editor for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed on un@@ certain days after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and dissem@@ ination of the newspaper on every way , including online , from 9 August 2016 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial in Mas@@ k@@ at court found the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court sentenced the three journalists to jail and ordered the final closure of the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convicted among others because of distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; Ab@@ or@@ atory of the State of State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of infr@@ in@@ gement of a publication of publication and sl@@ ander@@ ing .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year cust@@ odi@@ al pen@@ alties and fin@@ es in the amount of 3,000 gen@@ an R@@ ial ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , an annual profession was imposed against the two journalists .
al @-@ Ab@@ ri was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 R@@ ial ( 2600 US dollars ) after the use of &quot; an information network for spreading material that could represent a risk for public order . &quot;
on 22 August 2016 , for Al @-@ Ab@@ ri was set a damage deposit of 5000 gen@@ an R@@ ial ( 13@@ 000 US dollars ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Appeals Court said Al @-@ Ab@@ ri on 26 December 2016 at a hearing on 26 December 2016 , sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was dismissed on 10 April 2017 in accordance with his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he was involved in prison .
in addition to the decision of the Information Ministry , the Court of Appeal began to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper sees itself after attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order to pro@@ lon@@ gs the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information has personally signed a further statement which was extended by three additional months , in which the minister had extended another time against the decision of the Court of Appeal , the publication of the newspaper .
the continuous closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases , in which Oman was viol@@ ated the press freedom in recent years .
for example , for example , the closure of the web site of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ at@@ ine and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country , can be put into operation .
due to the continuous closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the authorities still are not willing to prepare an end to the extensive violation of the press freedom .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the Cuban authorities :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately post@@ ing and un@@ conditi@@ onally released ;
2. a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n to create their journalists in their work ;
3. to protect the press freedom in the country and
4 . under all circumstances , human rights def@@ enders and journalists must be ex@@ iled to the legal human rights of human rights , and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory work , including judicial k@@ ic@@ ans .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights ( also independent journalist , B@@ logger , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and the right to gather peaceful , supporting peaceful , supporting and protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is only rarely or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that addresses one of the most ur@@ gent needs of the continent .
for the necessary medical research , there are two reasons : for a lack of medical research , many medicines and vacc@@ ines , which cover the special medical requirements on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ culosis and malaria in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries of Africa far more gra@@ vit@@ ate consequences than elsewhere , and lack of investments in the investigation of these diseases are a great problem .
secon@@ dly , research , which is carried out by African scientists , organis@@ es its own research capacity in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Central Center of Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic , first engraved on the national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched on HIV virus before being decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
global Vo@@ ices discussed Dr. War@@ rier about the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media about these research .
( Dis@@ cla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ ri@@ rier talks to a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ ri@@ RW : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic national programme for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just rigid a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion about important current scientific topics in your country and general in Africa ?
how do they distinguish themselves from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we are only able to rely on solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always remain the receiver instead of ourselves .
the solutions that we get , are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here .
g@@ v : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it enough ?
just how easy or difficult to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from USA and Europe .
the projects are funded differently well .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or draw here , for financing and development chances are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : basic infrastructure is not equal to the standards in developed countries . it costs lots of money , a continuous supply with electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
g@@ v : how is the opinion of public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interested , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how big is your opinion according to the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I &apos;ve seen great students of all age classes .
there are need for special scientific training , beginning in every age .
social science , computer science , big data , research in the cos@@ mop@@ olitan , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa from western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often there are limited speed , things to do , and the resulting access to scientific expertise that represent the challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) is limited to the amount of available information and speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers produce global food production
this contribution of Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the site En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank M@@ orton has already been active in the USA for the 1980s .
his company offers 114 types of varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant , cultivated by NASA Astron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been consumed .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ ons work only through its own influences and the question as many sal@@ at@@ eries can be set .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more sal@@ ads were patented , and that he could not continue to use it .
the patents are not only for individual types , but also for certain properties like resistance to diseases , a special red or green or glued sheets .
over the past few years more such patents have been filed for ever more plants such as cer@@ eal or cart@@ ons . due to this trends , plant breeding and experts for food security ensure food production in the future of food production .
as a passionate representatives of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition , M@@ orton always loved ads , but he now needs longer , because his work will always be worth further restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , when a rock m@@ ugs should lie in a river where I must w@@ ishing them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore we have to do this now , but it is a fra@@ ction with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents are to go far away . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they keep court here , no one can pass a new oint@@ ments , because all features are already patented . &quot; he makes so good as possible and try to find those features which he wants .
however , it is very careful and ende@@ av@@ oured to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
he also joined one movement , which is always greater in the USA and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Room station ISS have red Roman sal@@ at the Sor@@ te Out@@ red@@ dish in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; station , and eaten . there we tested whether plants be cultivated in space .

it is not a co@@ incidence that this name sounds like that the movement from the IT field would come and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copyright protected software .
she was founded in order to ensure that some plant types and gen@@ ic are not protected as intellectual property and are used for plant breeding .
in the context of the initiative , a short Oss@@ i called Oss@@ i , US bre@@ eder can also under@@ take that others can freely use them from them .
however , this does not do that they can &apos;t make business with their seed into business and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ e@@ ders allow only others to prevent their seed , and not ex@@ h@@ end their own varieties - two aspects which are forbidden and prescribed by many plants .
dozens of bre@@ e@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
sc@@ aff@@ ed prospects
in the emer@@ itus Professor of Wisconsin &apos;s Madison and Oss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seed and the possibility to make new plants , both important for nutrition security as well as for environmental protection .
seed also plays a role in larger relations such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ e@@ ders would try to use the latter , not only little to use by being seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; Open Source &quot; movement does not work with genet@@ ically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , Cor@@ n , genet@@ ically modified or not , from ecological farming , and not to buy our goal of ecological sustainability , as such as it is offered on farms , should also know that the way is cultivated , like this vegetables , is threatened .
dietary change without seed so@@ vereign is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative do not under@@ take to provide other seed solutions to others . thus , their occurr@@ ence in contrast to seeds , seed and plant features are to be patented .

Oss@@ i supp@@ orters argu@@ ed that the future of food supply is vulner@@ able because the available pool due to the increasingly popular property rights of property rights , which is always restricted to limited , un@@ ab@@ duction cas@@ ual .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of Oss@@ i , has involved in her PhD with genetic variation in carr@@ ots and their availability . it found out that approximately one third of all box features are protected as intellectual property which is either not only usable for plant breeding .
for other plants , such estimates are not yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by gu@@ ards that measure resi@@ ded plants such as wheat into even greater style are patented as a salad or carr@@ ots .
a Question of Vis@@ ions
plants become so far@@ med that they have targeted traits - of such that their taste or their color improves up to such , due to them in certain environments , and thre@@ ats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ e@@ ders caused by ever more patents . genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever before , as the changed conditions caused by climate change much worse than ever before .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokesperson Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to know that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four co @-@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States set itself the company for the conservation of genetic diversity .
however , you contra@@ dic@@ ted that intellectual property may promote other bre@@ e@@ ders , since &quot; patents and the protection of plant varied innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken out , once the patent is expired .
often these instructions help others to come with another method for the same result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such a protection has been in@@ hib@@ ited to innovation , but promotes the public more material and know @-@ how are provided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ orton requires the different : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires , leave certainly no innovations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if they have been waiting to wait for plants that are adapted to plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the main argument for M@@ orton is that genetic resources have always been a common good , and it should remain even better : &quot; independent plant e@@ ders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ical inc@@ en@@ tives are not attractive to us .
we want to make farmers work easier .
this is what makes us ant@@ it@@ ement , and it is impossible to use it , if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
in total , M@@ orton def@@ aults to the concept to pat@@ enting the plant features : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics .
the plants form them from and as a gro@@ wer , we finally have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and Oss@@ i @-@ board , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who calls for care of his own values in them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large courts and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , which are needed for the cultivation of her@@ bic@@ ide , needs to be found in his varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is perfectly ge@@ ared . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents are able to survive the most smaller seed companies , even without patents , or keep it too expensive or so it is not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant breeding Frank M@@ orton is looking for sal@@ ads in his breeding garden Sal@@ ad .

M@@ orton is also the view that bre@@ eder is by the Av@@ oid of plant &apos;s innovative , &quot; it looks like that I can produce new efforts to produce new , stronger than companies .
I need a new material for my catalogue , since I know that my compet@@ itor will be able to sell my varieties in a couple of years , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent one is 20 years before competition , with which one makes it very nice . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the U.S. seem to be leading to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the concept has now spread quickly around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture , &quot; ) , which is itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed organization co@@ operate with farmers and helps them to combine new varieties that fulfill the specific requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed to come and sell their own .
the German Organization Agre@@ ates works on an &quot; open source &quot; license which ultimately takes a formal and legally binding form of the Oss@@ i obligation for bre@@ eder in the European Union .
( requirements for the breed differ from country to country , for the Oss@@ i obligation not simply could be taken over one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conventi@@ onally cultivated plants should not be patented . thus , they are against the present practice of the European Patent , which permits patents in the conventional plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no law nor the law ; now it is to bring to the governments of the Member States to implement the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , based on the farmers , non @-@ governmental organisations and seed companies from the whole East Africa to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards Pat@@ tern of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for the H@@ iv@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems that the organization is currently establishing a worldwide alliance to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , which will be scheduled to fall next year by the official start .
a merger of environmental and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development organisation US@@ C Canada and concentration - Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Ess@@ ential - a Verb@@ und from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation , and others - represents the opportunity to share and improve the seed policy that provide a stable care with food products .
in the report , the importance of a diverse , local supply is emphas@@ ised for sustainable food systems - a connection , from the Lu@@ by of Oss@@ i , hopes that it will soon be able to recogn@@ ise him soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food , especially on it , and how something has grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to procla@@ im men that even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
even more un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column .
on the weekend of the 5th of August , the Egyptian government dismissed the website of the First Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world , and documents about that time .
in August , the network published a position on Facebook in which it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region .
the Com@@ Network for Human Rights Information Con@@ trac@@ ts - despite this attack and the exp@@ ulsion of the Egyptian law and the constitution , to defend the law , to continue to overcome this targets , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I was not so important that all technical options have been exhau@@ sted , in order to overcome the sperm , and not to ad@@ mit it . we hope to meet our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blo@@ cked 21 websites of 21 websites , such as the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ language issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web offset against victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language h@@ tt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / N@@ IZ@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , in addition to the blog of the column , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt &apos;s blog .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for spread of Columbus and articles that he did not access in Egypt for Web sites and media .
now the blog which he set up in order to b@@ yp@@ ass the government of the Egyptian government , even goal of an attack .
B@@ logger , which is home to Canada &apos;s blog , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while working on the student protests and received a video like the police physical violence against two students .
his article turn mainly around politics and the human rights of human rights in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment Zi@@ ada expressed himself in the lock through the government and reflected the reflected this means :
the blo@@ gs is very old , however , has priority priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is , however , it is of two reasons for me :
1 ) It is able to give me the feeling of a siege to me ; an arrest , an attempted murder , un@@ loading at the national Security Council , the sperm blo@@ gs , and any other web page , for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I wrote not in vain . in other words , my words have an effect if also only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was a archive for me .
first , I used it to the post of articles to handle the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
now , after they have blo@@ cked him , and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the bra@@ ve go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities of 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this showed technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( IS@@ P ) , including orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers by clicking on paper c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday the 12th of June we knew how the sperm of web sites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such a such practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and filter to access the Egyptian users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is divided in addition to that the tick @-@ decisions behind the closed doors , thus making the Egyptian population does not have a legal basis because they can proceed in court against these actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government to go with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
fighting the inhabitants .

day for day reports in Brazil with huge head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard moti@@ fs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro murdered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; th@@ ieves from military weapons &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8500 troops of the Army , Marine and Air Force to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a forced financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio was the highest level since 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice had called for the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports about these are everyday and this is in@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; you will find at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the report published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra Day on August 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced , a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in town are now published there .
the moti@@ fs for their decision declared the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report on a crime that happens in each capital of the world , such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything that happens in Rio , will be published in the category &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our kind to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we didn &apos;t close our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video which was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ ede@@ an , chief editor of the newspaper , told that this decision was no occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper in all over the world with a war ru@@ in in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper was declared that according to the Institute for Internal Safety in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas , a journalist are controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial department the newspaper writes :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deliber@@ ately aware that a war @-@ dis@@ course , if he is distor@@ ted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police , the police , who sho@@ ots only and then asks questions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but we defend the war on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and their partners .
is the term &quot; war &quot; more than they profit ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bras@@ il argu@@ ed the journalist in Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , the violence as &quot; war &quot; to describe the media and could make it har@@ der , responsible for the police to the police .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - such as Extra at the analysis of the military rates in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investment in personnel , En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment and a historic and self @-@ counter@@ f@@ ading of public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital .

according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , the Rio de Janeiro is false : &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are located according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most recent available data .
no such cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
if we view the M@@ ord@@ rates per state , Rio is on position 16 , &quot; writes them .
an extra of the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company South America , is emphas@@ ised as Cec@@ í@@ lia , has repeated the security policy of the Sta@@ ats for years .
one of these security policy measures also belonged to the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ora ) , a police unit , which was set in 2003 by deployment of a massive police bed for a Fav@@ ela of police and to station@@ ing a unit permanently .
at the beginning of this fact , the U@@ PP has actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . since some years , the U@@ PP was forced to protect against milit@@ ants and repression against the poor municipalities that actually should protect the N@@ eo @-@ created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux origin@@ ates from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; Civil War . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this demands the state to go , means and paths , which are typical for a war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and the object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ation damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ locked balls &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the Fav@@ elas will remain in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a week it is now that the police seized the mountain by Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ emen .
in the midst of all these violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit juice died as a result of shots , which had fired the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieged Syrians to plant mushrooms

source : Can@@ Do@@ action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime .
according to victories World@@ watch , a common initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute , The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus , Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b currently about one million Syrians in a state of siege .
the Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly strongly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons requested the lives of hundreds of civilians in the 21st of August 2013 .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition , are based on the basis of research on the UN and other human rights organisations that the massacre was administered by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these reb@@ els were carried out under siege under siege under siege , which led to the evacu@@ ation or vic@@ tu@@ ated food by tun@@ nels and control points .
traditional food products such as flesh are become im@@ able to become too old for large parts of the population .
in contrast , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can produce their own mushrooms as &quot; food @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ man@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not belong to traditional , in Syria and are only very rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , it makes her food to become an attractive food source for many local residents of the besieged Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ tion of the Project , subscription Nab@@ il , said to the French News Agency AFP :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate the cultivation of pilgrims , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organ@@ izers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years , this project is well @-@ known and pressed his intention to gain more and more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Human@@ itarian Crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is planned to mediate 125 families of knowledge to plant pilgrims , Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this writing , they reached over 100 % of their expected target of approximately 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations in Can@@ do until Monday 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is based on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the fuel scar@@ city , they are used locally manufactured using plastic , to feed the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production from the regions of the fung@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before they checked their quality and if they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they planted a small mush@@ room yard in a tub . when this managed , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Teacher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the fung@@ us of various reasons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Re@@ breaking of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;

he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world , so that our success and fight against hunger and siege is visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to insp@@ ire our experiences in crisis areas and we can help mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese ur@@ ges justice for the victims of the season of 2017
several hundred people were protest@@ ed on 21 October in many district conferences in Portugal and called justice for the victims of fires , which is in the north of Portugal .
two and forty people were killed and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this took the government last week of solidarity with the victims of the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks , which spread themselves in the northern and central regions of the country , and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European Fore@@ stry system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite , are burned in Portugal by around 500,000 acres of forest - an area of the area of Lisbon .
so you can make a better picture from the Ernst of the location : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the se@@ eable tragedy
the goal of the protests of Saturday was the requirement for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the State .
the people survey@@ ed why civil protection was not able to destroy the extent of the tragedy so far as possible .
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al of the State of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
according to Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated to all and nothing .
these Sunday they did so somewhere . there are dozens of reports from open roads which were surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
in addition , construction permits in furn@@ aces with a high level of Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko asks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a far &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ra@@ ging &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Wal@@ tin , which the government had brought to severe fires in 2003 and 2005 , was carried out by the commun@@ es that saw the new rules as obst@@ acle for investments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the applicant &apos;s case permit a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; performs in the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Quer@@ cus tran@@ cus made known that large areas with Eu@@ cal@@ ypt@@ us , trees made from slightly combust@@ ible wood , like in a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ aya , according to the walls of this species continue .
to these problems , the website of the civil protection from Portugal on the 15th and 16th of October , as a resident of information , sought to contact persons , who was to contact offline .
it was an initiative that provided the population with information provided : they used the own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by developers Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of the Fire Brigade in October so that the server met the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users that followed the fires , not able to withstand more than half a million requests .

in a night in the autumn of 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began in the Taliban .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings that had defeated the short @-@ lived per Soviet government . Afghanistan had become a land of terror and desp@@ air .
at this time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ ha@@ zn@@ i in Central af@@ gh@@ istan , for the last time with his family , together .
even if his mother didn &apos;t say it then , she knew that she would not see her son very long - maybe even more .
in dawn the boy was breaking .
his un@@ cle would take him , and bring him to the fl@@ ail .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ election , was killed by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly on himself .
the Taliban met for their hat@@ red to the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country toward Pakistan or Iran .
days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
a few years he worked in a coh@@ ort . the work was difficult , and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his low wage , and went into Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and towing sacks with mort@@ ars , which were he@@ avier than he himself to earn his life .
at that time , the life of Afghan refugees were character@@ ised by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the site where we worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no heating there , no heating . we hanged nylon in front of the open window , so that we do not tum@@ ours at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran , and made for the trip to Europe .
at the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited island .
after the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af returned to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ k hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , close to parks and went to a church that divided twice a day in help@@ fulness .
it is true that Italy due to relatively high reference quot@@ as is a kind of chance for asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that conditions , asylum seek@@ ers can be found in the country , cat@@ ast@@ roph@@ ic .
the human rights organisation of Civil liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system is suffering from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special recording centers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; there is impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ skilled and un@@ prepared staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian Law , asylum seek@@ ers only can be assigned to a recording center , when it officially set an application for asylum - what you can go on after the registration of the asylum request .
until then , people who have no money to have accommodation , either to the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the road .
so it was A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ w@@ ron@@ ged way of life helped A@@ shar@@ af to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions .
after having made several years working in construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af moved his entire creation in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that after a while still a second hostel and a sn@@ ak@@ e@@ iss opened .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is &apos;s success story is now on the topic of the handic@@ apped Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind the Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wah@@ id@@ i .
the film received the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureau@@ cracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
in the past few years some of Afghanistan are driven companies , including tail@@ or , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants have even been awarded in the Italian press for its excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea to give birth to his restaurant Orient Experience , in which the cellars and the kitchen staff are mostly part of refugees from various parts of the world .
the lum@@ ber menu is told by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts to the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afghan business@@ man Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the p@@ izzeria Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s are far enough to reach Italian restaurants and retail , and aim to the land which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happy when I know that my people are suffering .
I have a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and have to get the same options as all others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af schmi@@ es also plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can sell packaging and preservatives in the market . &quot; so , they can sell their yields on the market and improve their financial situation . &quot; he says .
the development of successful entrepren@@ eurs was a journey through un@@ certainty and doub@@ ts , but at the end there is stability and pro@@ sper@@ ity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this trip himself . now he would like to help others to Afghanistan in this way .

the Egyptian Parliament reviewed a bill , which shows that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration in government authority .
users would have to use social networks to use social networks , within six months after the most successful legisl@@ ature order on the website of the authority referred to their full name as well as their identification number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imprisonment or the final payment of a criminal deposit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law , which was designated by sixty @-@ members of the members , is currently present to the legislative and constitutional committee of Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
another member of parliament filed a legislative proposal in May , in the har@@ der pen@@ alties for the interests of the President or a high civil servants .
under Egyptian law the ins@@ ul@@ ting of the President and state facilities have already been stra@@ pped . under the law there would be such a such case with prison and money @-@ pen@@ alties , as right @-@ wing of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law should be adopted , this can mean to three years imprisonment for the convicted .
in addition , this would have been a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom has been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud subscription Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated Egyptian police officers to demonstr@@ ating military coup led to the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 Protestant participants who were arrested by the same incident , four years in prison for a trial date .
recently , his trial was post@@ pon@@ ed to the 20th of May , because the prison term failed to stop the def@@ endants with the def@@ endants of the prison in the court hall .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to a , so many human rights groups agree , head@@ light from among others arms , illeg@@ itim@@ ate assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court acquitted G@@ iza the two journalists of H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indicted for their reporting on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalist Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who also had been detained at the previously mentioned incident , aged 25 to 5 .

this document , which was published on April 21st at Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website , raises a light on it , such as the presidential plans for the support of the legisl@@ ature .
by Ben G@@ har@@ bia , the nam@@ ing of his sources under indication of Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press does that journalists sec@@ ures the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , in the District Court in Tunis on 09 May , he entered the case as a witness .
will China for@@ cing social media to submit their identification ?
according to new regulations of the Information Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require a permit before they write messages into social media .
in addition , the registration is indicated that the registration is necessary to the full @-@ full name .
anal@@ ysts toler@@ ated that this is supposed to be achieved by the elimination of anonymous comments in entertainment within social networks . it is now un@@ clear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese network citizens proposed in social media to protect this regulations just sel@@ ective to protect the journ@@ alism and independence .
