<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My dear to America is extraordinarily big.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American movies, American writers will be read and operated in American music.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a great profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When I was 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Granite in The Pelican letter, a fearful reporter, who covered the former Federal Court with judges who wanted to take his interest to his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "It's the absolute truth, forget everything I want to do with my life" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, I had only strengthened my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "I always said," "" "America is the only country where I ever lived, whose variety is so welcoming that you're always" "" "you're always that you are, and it is easy to accept people in a community of equal people." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very narrow love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me, how he moves to its uncleanness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as you says so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he considers, as a former colleague it express, and proclaimed publicly contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afrode and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his testimonies and agreed in pairs for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, which he won with the Republican election, was the highest number ever reached by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this biguous person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I was able to bring Trump and his electors in accordance with men, which I learned during my time in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalist, destroys people from around the world, a deep guy of believing, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps did not agree with the "Cincinnati Inquirer," which is the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Acolerance is also in contrast to the fundamental movement that I experienced by Sandy Bahr, who struggles for life to the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is still adapting to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always with patience and suffering from me and my colleagues helped us to reconcile us to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser counsel helped me much with my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those caused by embored values deepened my love in America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump in his way to the nominated republican presidential candidate, they call me a halt and the counterpart of his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they shared either its racism and fanaticism, or because they were prepared to overtake these things, almost the heart brake me.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to describe the Trump-voters as a racist.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "people" "" "people said," "" "said one of my friends, exactly what has led us to this situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectless and indicates an inability to understand those who act on a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that its worries and fears about the hectic changes in their churches are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters have voted for Trump, because they would like to re-win control over a country, which does it be disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">With other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">But you hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting the cruel decision to rise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (o. agape).: as much as "rejection of the White against all Other Ethics"; The word game made of white at the White and whiplash, which means the great Van Jones, did it exactly what America did so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background you can always have, America is called every welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">Because this country chose his president twice the son of a Kenyaners, whose history, how he himself says that somewhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America's promise and says: to Hell with frequent, religious freedom and the entire term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the America after 9 / 11 the white man will say again at the Ruder, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">At all that I have to remember Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, would have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The people responded with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"had Muslims a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" roaring the amount.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they called them and their voices." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone, who isn't like you, has a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received an impressive and loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan ended with the words: "thank you, Mr. Trump, is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Country, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who like Mr. Khan, could not find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And mine heart breaks me.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero congregation in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguaische City Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music that is played on both places, not only the life of children has changed, but also a close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the trash</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular among tourists, but worlds of the nearby rural ruins and its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">Since some years now the La Banda de Música (Musikbande) is now playing in the municipality: one of the children and adults of existing Symphonie Orchestra, which has found its musical instrument a possibility to overcome them surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs-abuse and the Banden violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilots who started a musical project and offered a rare hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young members take their obligations towards the musical group, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch, they run through the dusty streets to meet her great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always come to and play with shiny eyes and play in the Trusteels Day for Day Trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village which lies practically on the largest garbage dump of Asunción in the capital city - on instruments that are made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with recurrent instruments made of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling line conducted by Favio Chávez thus started to transform parts of the waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violin, frying, celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all of which have been made of garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan, Latin American music and music by Beatles, Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez recalls a local ecologist and musical teachers of the children of Cateura, to the initial time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place where parents didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something that he had never seen before: a violin made out of trash.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a complete orchestra which plays on instruments made of recovered material and is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary section "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) draws the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and live by him are the poorest - like people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they walk in a little beauty.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectacle from garbage-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra recorded music even before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These eastern African countries show how technology and teamwork can fight the illegal fishery</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing fought.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine published specifically for international and practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The recovery occurs in the context of a deal with Global Voices to the common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa it was known that this ship had already run illegally fishing waters in Liberian waters before the other coast of Africa had sought.</seg>
<seg id="101">The Eastern African countries have been associated with this correspondingly and slightly inclined, to be called a lawyer for this species to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comintern, Mozambique and the Seychelles, quickly towards the ship. they refused to serve one of its harbours and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the premier was surrounded by countries which you simply refused" "" "Benect Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan Fisheries Authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship and persecuted this time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not managed to catch the fish.</seg>
<seg id="105">At the end, there was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia, due to pillaging the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which protects and protect resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar on the six countries who had driven out the Premier of their waters back then.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries and work together and are going to work together." "" "Tony Long, Head of Pv Charitable Trusts project" "" "says Tony Long, Head of Pev's Ending Project Ending illegally Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition, which is taken captive, is hidden, essential because of it is extremely difficult. therefore, the Illegal fishery is a main cause of the overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By clear abuse of existing laws, by which certain habitats and types are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems which have a deliciate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, during the actions against the illegal fishing once caused by bureaucratic hurdles, these actions happen in real time with the information between individual countries and traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries, for example, lists existing licenses to exchange licences, news to digest activities or details that you notice during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships even very attentive when they move around the open lake, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows to characterise ships to know ships in banned areas. so, they can discover that a ship grooves to other ships, so that a ship invites its caught fish on other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the involved ships have a fishing licence, where they were on the way and perhaps, whether they have an offfreister.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fish catch, can be found on the basis of such ships in their ports. what means that the ships could not sell their charge, and that they could even be forced to numbers of penalties, as in the case of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there is significant financial losses for the owner, meaning that the illegal fishing catch is no longer worth." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Chief Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a mountain company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to rewin estimated 20 million USD on lost sales, giving the eight members of the HISH network each year due to illegal fisherman, penetration in Eastern African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish plants, in the way which the region attracts commercial fishing around the world. among these also invaliated the illegal fisherman.</seg>
<seg id="122">Other practices include actions like the sailing under false flag, fake license documents, indication of phasiencies, fish protected species and fish in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "you have targeted the lack of international cooperation and the weaknesses of a non-bridge control system," "" "said Long." "" "a ship was illegal to fishing and a country could then say 'You must not run my port." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Komm to me'. "and exactly this legal gorge tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks to spread the counterfeit Licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found it trips and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its collaboration with Interpol, the international authority for combating crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations bring us quite far in the networks of organisational crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i, suspected ships to be precise.</seg>

<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which has always been developed continuously, helps to hide the illegal ships that would like to hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "the illegal fisherman use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NRO as well as FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn on for example their automatic identification systems, which they can no longer be tapped by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that connects different information levels. it should help FISH-i help to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">One model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's Team African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened together with Google and the Maritime Organization Oceana "platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of each of the traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with neighbours, to get a better picture of it, those who do - that's just what makes sense" "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to join forces and to bundle their resources for the study." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project, where a global system must permit the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only sad, but also abstain from locusts.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously exploited without license and hardly have to calculate with consequences, know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i took a 33% increase in fishing net sales, since then fishing boats more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia, Greko 1 opened up, the inspectors took place on board towing systems whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also realize these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that us now also include other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "in West Africa vanish several hundred million dollars annually by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">There will be six countries together in 2015, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. Moreover, they fight also the Illegal fishery, according to exactly the same model such as FISH-i. "with security, even more such initiatives and structures will also arise in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member country took part in his first major triumph: in October, Greko 1, a ship which was under a false flag. and not only the ship was used without a license and were used to use towing networks.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also included in banned waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "take a strong character that they proceed against illegal fish catch," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>

<seg id="163">Within the framework of the social, political and economic crisis, the inflation rate is among the highest in all over the world (the inflation rate is considered to be 500% at the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine is considered to give the chance to pursue its institutional structures and a new government alliance.</seg>

<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to view the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult husband said Quijano in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Cordoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial which ended on 24 August 2016, a crime was examined, which were committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano is not looking for his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting at the Bürde, the same name as his father carry up to the brutal military operations in the La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years, he retained the family secrets for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation then I believed that was in order.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, you don't notice that one will be manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I was not able to know that my father was a thief, follower and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeriebeamter. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Prime Minister 141 in the prison of La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>

<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressed, which is charged with abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in nearly 100 cases and abduction of a 10 year old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos Son, a man who had experienced the magnitude of the atrocities which he had experienced as boy, and who told his own father against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">Its history shows what great power has a parental part over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father began to take me to the military base, I often went with us into the sports hall. there I had always made me with a boys, the martial sport.</seg>
<seg id="217">All they called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black-and photo and urged me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are a shole, you have been rounded to you with one of the ERP.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide prevalence of translators are diverse.</seg>
<seg id="377">For example, you need two important abilities: passive language skills to understand the output text and are active language skills to transfer him to the destination language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active rule of the target language - something that is in the case of the native language. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the language language - native language.</seg>
<seg id="379">This should not be a French native language for example from English to French - not from the French in English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ employees with English as the native language that could justify translations into English. this may be done in lack of understanding for the overweight, quotations or the relatively small number of English speakers that can learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have not have any foreign employees, yet have translations firstly. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered to be the best in English - no matter how good or bad his language knowledge are truly remarkable.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrents and rigmatic sentences created by mechanical translations will show that this technique may replace long no human translator. this applies to some languages very particularly.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the most strange English formulation in Japan, among them the smoothest prints, often used T-shirts or pockets, are used only from stylish reasons - not to be read or understood even.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr-users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors like beauty are still acceptable or at least harmless. but by major companies or from the government, which have funds to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The City of Kyoto uses a serious source of their translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="503">If he is accepted by Parliament, users of social media must register in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law then it would be set up a place that was commissioned to use Citizens, citizens and citizens to share social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with acceptance of the law, users would have to register for users with their right name and staff numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it is failed to do this, this could bring a penalty of up to six months of imprisonment or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs, and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt independent, defines social media as "jedwede application, which is going through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video messages and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is accepted if there is no indication, as Egyptian authorities cannot order the registration that the Egyptian government is not able to register that the Egyptian government is currently not able to guarantee the regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, Parliament and promoter of the Law, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and user received a user name and a password "to come through the firewall, which blocks Facebook."</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shvaccine, the progress made in the North East of Japan have been achieved to rebuild the life of those who had been reformed by the "" "" three-fold catastrophe "" "" of March 2011. the disaster was triggered by disaster accident in Fukushima. "" "</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung is located in Thai, which is located in Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi prefecture - Miyagi prefecture, had to experience the earthquake and the tsunami prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbor of Fukushima and Iwate were forced evacuated, because the tsunami had vanished whole coasts of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Fukushima Prefecture still experienced a nuclear accident, already around 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Shimpo is reflected in the local vision of the progress made six years later to rebuild the life of local farmers.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of Japanese re-building authorities as well as survey results of the data subject.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing estate in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">In December 2015, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that 77 per cent of the planned spare homes (s) (s), saigai kouei juutaku) were finished in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi's largest success was achieved by Miyagi's three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned spare buildings were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has finished 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima happened at 70 percent the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Even six years after the catastrophe, still six years after the disaster, evacuated from accommodation (s), casetsu juutaku) had to be moved to definitive replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-fold catastrophe, almost 80 000 people were forced to live in Behaviths.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated from Fukushima still living in notices, whereas Miyagi had more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuated people were evacuated after the disaster in the home of accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is below 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of works and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by the disaster, opened its doors to December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction is far more difficult in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are again put into operation, in Fukushima only 30 percent of fishing ports are regenerated.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident, have moved in the three prefectures of agricultural land in partnership.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed arable farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that only one episode of the nuclear accident is, because only 690 hectares are destroyed out of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land of Fukushima, in the "nuclear area."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered extensively, but also Fukushima remains far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist pay in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 percent on the same stand as before the disaster. Fukushima can only be 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it seems more difficult to earn their habitat.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a complete picture, the newspaper introduced many surveys under local population and evacuated under evacuation. she asked them about the state of rebuilding, and how you'll find our receiving directly opposite the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey conducted by more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of the resident population have seized measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in Catastrophes prevention has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">How about those who had evacuated from the Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has increased their attention to the situation of evacuated Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima did not only experience the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture Fukushima happened also a witness of the worst, catastrophic accident in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 people evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were some more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima still live outside their country prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">Most of the evacuated areas, most of the evacuated areas, which are still in Behaviaries, are known as 50 years old. it is necessary to compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. this is about construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games, which will be held in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="627">The Municipality of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the Western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is widely known as a Central - on Spanish Sugar mill - known, regardless of what there is no significant sugar harvest.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were produced in the sugar tube plants.</seg>
<seg id="629">Following the proceeds, the sugar cane industry in the region still lost, and the factory lost after and after its plants, until only the rumours of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to find themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changes the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and commences every day on the factories which still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a solo veteran who resists every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry is smoked to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are in the East of the Suggestion factories that have been in operation after a long-active time, because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">It was something that he was not expected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds himself that in MañalI would receive the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resistor the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the Inephering, the poor administration decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for the country some decades ago, but the bad conditions have been no more realism.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the church already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was a economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane mills were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive they were untracked for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories that produce sugar for up to 4 Centavos (0,03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs that led to these measures were low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the care rise in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again before a decade.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the cost of unrefined sugar is to remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published by the OECD and FAO, the Agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the crude sugar would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything ran good</seg>
<seg id="652">"today's Day is going to enter into history," these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From then, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, a total of 98 sugar cane factories came out, over 65 million people received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same thing happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14. may 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about the closure of the factory, the word that he is most repeated, "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Nearly all respondents are of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to get the place, they set a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">In front of the first phase of the year, the first letters started to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">"" "" "" "it was officially declared documents that would be removed only concerning the parts that would be removed, the address and the date." ""</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ultimo Rosales del Toro, but the minister was able to approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From there, the responsibility was overlooked, and the letters came increasingly more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut-down factory for two years, and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money covered for the still in operation."</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years waiting for retirement in another plant, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the standstill of the factory, whose construction he helped, was involved.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each portion which he removed, he disassembled one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The most developed industrial sector in Cuba and most important work of work was deleted.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, no alternatives for the employment and services that were generated in the municipalities were generated, in which they found themselves.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know whether during the Mammalogy address of 21 October 2002, the time president in the eyes of those present people saw, when he guaranteed, whose factories was not in operation for five years, everything would run well.</seg>

<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory completed, or better, when they began to disassemble it, they also heard on asphalt road that disadvantaged other companies.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy other factories had to look.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording a song of "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with the approval of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities in all Canada are dealing with topics that are important for them. they do with hip hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N 'we Jinan Tour, since 2014, workshop manager for mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres, to offer youth groups songwriting, photo, audio and video production and live appearances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogue David Hodges who lives in Montreal and in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with Cree Hip Hop Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is thus that young participants in conversations topics such as "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self-acceptable" or whatever is found in mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na acsa' yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a street section in Westcanada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were killed or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely implemented.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemkhi Cree First nation uses the motif of a video player to mediate, as important from the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences through globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people have not always rule the languages of First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation have recorded, the refrain is sung in Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people took a little help from Gary Jolly by the Northstars Hip Hop Group who gave them a strophe in the dialect of Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebookpage of N 'we Jinan, the strophe is available in writing, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel, no one would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on earth for my days</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day that you will take our scream</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will raise us a day</seg>
<seg id="710">I would not like to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So you can grow and are as well as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So you can do it, for what it is determined by the Creator</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see almost every restaurant of plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, what exactly are on the menu, will be exhibited in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (Fig.), "Plastic Models of the dishes") of each food is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers can see these plastic geries and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to manufacturing these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Kappabashi's district, there is a variety of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes, which documented the German filmmakers Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these are these plastic grounded so usually that they are not even more to all. a new trend turns it today in remarkable cell accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">In Naver Matome, the Bataloginii series of social media links and photos, show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanlet.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic shredded mobile phone tapes, as shown in Kichijoji Tokyu purchase house.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed to kitten collection objects, as in this case, refrigerant magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shores refrigerated refrigerated for a new exhibition at Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of the essence becomes increasingly difficult.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) is transformed into a mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="730">For these triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="731">Also this part we have produced for the exhibition at the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple, using your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like a apple, with a score for the mobile phone, this is a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing arrival.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile-stand and mobile-designer allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case, icura or salmon are used, a popular topping, served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter a few users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "there is someone who say," "" "Wow, cool, now I can strip my mobile phone with salmon?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic geries can also accept a less appetite form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">Furthermore, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and handybands of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other skurrile plastic dishes can be seen under: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # 2. it's very smooth.</seg>

<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reading of Animal Político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in the state of Guerrero.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that one should never consider that violence should never be considered normal, in which form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I know disease and sensation journalism now for some years.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come every day to newspaper kiosks and see the cover pages with images that are actually only from a textbook for criminology or from files by specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me from the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I have the feeling when I am the only one who is wisted or sad. it acts as a lack of respect to the person who was once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be usually valid or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10 year old cousin think that he is big. and it's not normal that people listen to the "helmets" of the offenders "when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, it is that, when would they lose those who have lost someone, and those that fear them, even something happened.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories to blooming numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The facts of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified by it. "</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to agree that they are spared out of such tragedies when they are not stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of pressage in the main city area: as a family with threats were looted." in this, she describes how the armed crime month of her business was not only destroyed by the end, but also her family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you lost, and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>

<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega released the article "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a Generation of Violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions on how: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by the organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it possible to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of her.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a Waise and he tells us that he needed himself, how to make a egg coiled, potatoes broth, tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">It tells of the nine folks on his left hand side - one for each year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and had to learn to live thereby.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, one told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years before, when he was just a few blocks from his home, the bloody suffering of his father, who was shot by armed men from an exemplary car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez saw that:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was organized through the organized crime and fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of citizens according to the Council of Public Security and the Government of the United States government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor was 3103 Morde. this is equivalent to 8.5 Morning per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some of thousands of thousands of stories which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate it into the country's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories still live in view of the new headlines. this project is reminiscent of us that we must not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" in 2015, the data journalism project Narcoco has established the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tortured the country over the past four decades, in intelligible way.</seg>

<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and carcases in streets and bushes.</seg>

<seg id="841">"" "the numbers could not be confirmed." "" "no one stayed back to count the dead," "" "said a people to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were zoned, shot, or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only from satellite images the follow-up time could be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack remained unexplained, but the army-based in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of the Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here's the picture from the DR Congo again, when it was a proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>

<seg id="931">Religion understood and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is necessary to investigate how images can be used in connection with these efforts.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to enter here and now despite a language barrier with somebody in connection?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling Initiative (TLS), is the count of stories in their original language a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently over a new initiative by Steven Bird, the Inaugurable Blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but in the spoken word. this is an attempt to get language variety of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in the United States, where TLS has already been carried out since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages are not given to the native children.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world can be avoided, if we do cities ensure disparity - safe spaces, in which inhabitants must not forget to belong to them.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening to what often is connected," "" "do these events instead" "" "listens to appreciate, to make." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers create their history first in their own language and translate or tell them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "even if the participants are not a professional storytellers, their devotion, and the representation of the fact that the listeners were interviewed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions, unless the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">For example, the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou consulates also the opportunity to clarify the land of typical customs of war.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the fork from the bunnies and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after having declared the importance of his ring, John Nyamusara is asked:" "" "how is this to speak to an audience that your language does not understand?" "" "with a broad Grinsen, he divides his feeling of incomprehensivity:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">They have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of the Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can be organise with TLS in order to organize their own levels.</seg>

<seg id="1185">At this year's re: publica, the annual conference on digital culture, organised in Berlin, devoted an event to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>

<seg id="1187">The book which was published last year and is licensed here, includes a number of attachments which deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction there is:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to educate how to create movements for free knowledge and what are the true cost, with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, engineers, researchers and authors, involved in the movements of free knowledge, have been working on page to view over the fog, who gives our newsfeeds and create something sense of our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was knitted from the directory of the Adra prisons in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current condition or stay.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that wanted to release his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel has paid a high price for his participation in a free culture, has to begin many of us to think about their own destinates, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we now here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process from time-time extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">Since March 2012, the webdeveloper of Open Source and digital activity has been detained by Syrian government agencies.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military installation, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police on the basis of a" strictly geheim "had taken prisoner of the military court of his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that it was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, who then presented themselves as a Insider of the Assad government and asked them of an alleged death sentence against their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His residence and condition remain still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a decisive role in it to expand access to the Internet and to know the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, Technologist and currently supervise the ladder of New Palmyra, a project that formed Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of the bass-cultural prototypes, perhaps, was a work that he began to work with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually design the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilizations and are merging Greek-Roman architectural types with hiesful traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel was not yet able to know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS would set everything that architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but the world embodies.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strapping into the digital archaeology and the preservation has created a time capsule which will be to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of uninvaluable value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not conclude this project until now.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life to dream of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I was overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English by, even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read and speak English to speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">"" "he always has his knowledge with everyone, who asked," "" "he has taught others to read, write and speak." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened me the gateway to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also brought others to others, as they are using computer, at least theoretically, without knowing that they actually held in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (waiting), a prosabotary, which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was imprisoned in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for a year.</seg>

<seg id="1249">Those who have been arrested or executed under violence through the regime, were tortured or executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">By 2016, according to the International Human Rights Organisation, Amnesty International died at least 17.723 Syrians in prison since 2011.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mosambique: due to corruption corruption and dismissal back to previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">The Mozambique reacted with anger on a corruption of corruption in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus at which the corruption has been committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is a Diodino Cambaza, which was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison for a serious dispersion of 54 million metical (about 800 000 Euro) for 22 years.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds at the airports of Mozambique, whose council Cambaza was from 2005 to 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and demanded immediately his resetting into the company, what happened on April 19 then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the General Prosecution of the Republic, which granted the request, there was no obstacle course for Cambaza, back to its old position, as the company had no disciplinaract after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants have not called the action.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Budade Pública, shortly CIP), a local institution that sets itself for public transparency, condemned in an interview with the German wave the decision of the company to redefine the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step in terms of the efforts of our legal system, so CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">"" "" "" "what we have knowledge, that the company should have a disciplinaract process against the incorruptible would have." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company was silent, however, and caused no appropriate legal steps to use the respective functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the mosaic social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as "resistible":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would have been a consultant after he was sentenced to one prison sentence and half of which have eaten half.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could have paid lectures and motivating words, he could consult and his image polishing.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, it has distilled to be reintegrated into the company which he helped damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is like to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Respiratory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil says the director knows no morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">The state of Cambaza was rewarded by the State because he didn't believe him, that someone has been rewarded to such a massively in such manner as well.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the morality to return and serve the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but only served only on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza was used to state the state, when handlebars used to get an exhaustible money source and state itself, this man became tired, the previously loaded and finally sentenced to a long sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honest, I don't know why this guy was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte, it preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel that a thief belongs to the prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves do not belong to the prison Samora Machel the Mozambique will not only be remembered as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, slitting and - by saying - prophetic Redner.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was, when he affirmed that "an ambitious man was to be able to sell his own individual interest, to sell his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said, "I don't know if a ambitious man change that my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactics, but he doesn't turn from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious man is a crime. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also rejected:</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known Social Network expanded its postal order from the net, because they abstained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although it is still discussing the source of the word, it is normally used to refer to people east Indian origin or generally used as an adjectively. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or it. it was a part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate crimes in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the ascension of radical nationalist movements was given an extremely abbreviated loan.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly used for ultra-nationalists as an event of hate Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the effort, hate in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of practical content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism in connection with racism, but the word does not call themselves from Hasselt.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that, in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed in doubt for the purpose of its use, censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are several burmese words with fundamental different meanings that have the same accounting sequence like 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, stool is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (Spellbse), 'Kalar oat' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookneaded Aung Kaung Myat declared the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today, because he contained the Word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a spiritual way, whether they could wanting to linch his back pain, by making a word game.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The set ku la - "healing" (ku) + the questioner (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win HAD is the opinion that, in Hassamical, radical nationalists, however, stressed that Facebook analytic would be divination before it deleting all the Posts that tries to spread Rassismus in suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook deletes the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The Automism will not understand what you can write to factions.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead, to analyze the post carefully and check it by using the same words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar pae "(Spell bsen).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that this dreadly nationalists, the Hassler spread, a rather good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the promotion has a strong signal to everyone, the hate language may spread, the efficiency of this strategy may not be long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proved that the censorship of keywords often have a cat and mouse game, whereby the users can simply start social networks, a new word or alternative writing of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author of Aung Kaung Myat described as Facebook began to delete his posts when he would only communicate his friends, that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attentive to this new guideline of Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and me, the liken, post and share of Content for 24 hours is prohibited because the post "Facebook community standards did not escape."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a great number of Posts from people who have no negative intentions or that simply try to show their opinions against the Hasselt radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed, who has nothing to do with hate language:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without Hasselt from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author told his opinion, why extreme nationalism and religious Fundamentalism are poorly poorly in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more on the beginning of the initiative, for example, the Burmese Internet community asked for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a beneficial intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words will be censored only more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition, it seems to be allowed to have this without a local context or technical support, as" "" "chair" or "" "" inheritance "" "" or "" "" pesencurry "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found that they have made mistakes, they didn't try to report the actual postal order.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits would have a great turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorable has provided for a lot of fun among the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of serious, users can now take advantage over Facebook and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hasselt to see if their Posts will be taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook Posts, which were not found in Hasslanguage, but nevertheless removed:</seg>

<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to eat and watch an Indian film on a chair and watch an Indian film.</seg>

<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious Fundamentalists, social networks have used to expand their voices and their impact.</seg>

<seg id="1338">On Facebook, Facebook has been criticised for his failure to have criticised Hasselt to his bursenticular pages under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than simply failing the word 'Kalar', it would have better been better to see context than on the code of concentrated initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1391">On 18 January 2012, the English-language Wikipedia page was endowed with the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA Copyright Act.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than one month, Turkey has now been the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for day is more significant how important the platform is for users to find helpful staff as well as reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students as well as reporters and fans of TV-series watches themselves against the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques are used, Internet users are used to use locking tools for blocking websites (a current article from the New York Times that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been published articles from Wikipedia, as recently as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, will find regular blocking of the Internet since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most important country in the world when it goes around the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, there are now several MirrorPages (pages, reflected the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator computer connections), which is not based on the system of domain name and thus making a complete censorship.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "" "" "the content is activated despite legal prohibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogger IPFS reported about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the messages (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we were able to complete everything, snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, the opportunity to read the contents on decentralized and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content, even if it can't reach the website www.wikipees org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also demonstrated that this step was done independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it just was screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to handle the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consunny from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiknopedi.org, a mirrorside of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to do similar mirrorsides, when in the respective country Wikipedia is brought forth.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consoli reported subhashish Panigiri - Global Voices, as well as employees at Mozilla at the Panigiri's Open "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">If one gets to another URL, which is not the original. that what you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server will continue on the right Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are blocked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server, which is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women with greatest care is to discuss the names of their husbands or even by older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a Pronomen or tell the father of my child. "</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chendisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women that they should respect the husband of the husband, as well as fear of the consequences, they should consider the norm.</seg>

<seg id="1475">"" "" "" "the tradition of her wives are not common in the name, is also common among men. however, they have much less access to fear if ever, they should not follow these practice." ""</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health staff, and maids, a unique club, and were thus quickly became the main meeting of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">There is a place only for them alone, in which they discuss the hostility of the patriarchate and discuss.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which exists in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community video Volunteers and is involved in the dismantling of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera to the discovery of practices, such as children's up to the exile of HIV- and AIDS patients, and guides this club.</seg>
<seg id="1480">They reported how this club created a safe place for this women and made them at the same time at the ambassador of the mural.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini showed in its discussion round, made women who call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">It has decided on this topic because they wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem where women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not according to the names of their husbands, it is a fire that pleaded not guilty to all the obligations and have never been questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't hold this will be regarded as a herlistened, as woman without Moral.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never made ourselves up to that discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning of the Rohini, the husband, who had never called her husband, had never tried to try at home at home.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother in law and my husband still weigh long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me, and said," "" "I should call it from now on his name." ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in Baggage, Rohini started its first discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that it would be a good thing, because it meant the younger members of a family, especially girls and women.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women tried to bring discussion with an exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini requested each participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoys, sadly, lovingly, affectionately and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then they asked them," "" "If we cannot say the name of our husbands," "" "But they can call us as they want," "" "does that they have not respect us?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent to it? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of those women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom she brought the name of her husbands on lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra, in which women married women the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that, during the whole exercise, they did not go ahead. another decided to leave the whole incentiful frustration against him and his family until they cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ekstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the Adrenal-frenzy, with an ancient fires broke, the women decided that they were actually trying to call their husbands in the name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days, Rohini received a number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"" "the husband of a wife called Rohini and asked what ideas they put on women in the head," "" "his wife could not cease to say his name." ""</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-mother murdered her, she got afraid, and told that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini meant, I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in violence was less understandable and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women tries to stop other practices, such as the example of the zinnored score on the forehead, which shows the Eheststatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why must only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would bear the zinnored point when he was doing it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I listened to bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"" "" "" "the other women have not heard complete, but I think they are now in a better position to choose from it on some days." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion group is a safer place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make an excursion on each discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want to make sure that women could do," "" "says they." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the past months, they celebrated their own birthdays with Cake; they danced and sang and spoke about things that they had never made.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working for so many years to these problems and yet, I also have more about some things, such as our identities are linked to our husbands, never as honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say that certain things can say, quite no matter how small it occurs.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we have underlined ourselves on the concept of honor and is connected to the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been born only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Most of them is okay, but some wanted to bear a ointment-Kurta, a wide shirt on a trousers; they didn't have.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much argument and discussion about the advantages of the own coat-selection, the morals associated with Saris and much more, tastes its own pair of Kurtas (Obershirt) in a discussion round, so that women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they now decided to plan to plan a trip to Goa where you can wear Jeans and Rohini is sure that they will create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months since their first discussion lub have changed something, Rohini confirms that things get slowly into the roll:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then heard it again to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, me not included, but only if they are alone and not other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to write the names of their husbands; one or two women now bear interest rates at any time Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in discussion lub know that the changes that they would like to reach them in their lives - like the Feiling to be more freedom of movement or your own clothes choice - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To give each other self-confidence, realising them that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a Victims of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives everyone of us the hope that something is changing.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if every woman goes home to the club and other people, what we speak and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may appear dumm, since Singapore is recognized as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has caused a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State Association of New York, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>

<seg id="1696">It is that volcanic, it had the form of a flight before the responsibilities, a mandatory breach.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons of Shanmugam were not very Nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of whose, it appeared uncertain undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">However, however, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>

<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls Shanmugam to illustrate his opinion, since they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally think it is a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so to which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Shortly, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">"" "" "" "I would be very grateful if our" "" "K Shanmugam would take on the effort to clarify this point, if he was highly paid to be part of the government of Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1709">By declaring his commentary on the blog, he refers to the critics that you should begin to understand the entire title of the conference, so that you could understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam better, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the title.</seg>

<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes it right and aware of what he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek review crushes the weaknesses of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Lord Shanmugam "committed a mistake," or was it a friend spokesman?</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrant who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, he is located at the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is directed by a 59th year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a corals-pink Brillenframe and gold colored earrings in teddy form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a target for Afrikaners and Haitians, who are on the passage.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For approximately $2.50 the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with grinding, sloping walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the entrance hall, there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the Hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants join here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells the people in full scale buses and off the upper part of the coast they begin to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment, it is rather quiet but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She wants to refuse to refuse.</seg>
<seg id="1913">They also helps them, and bring them to the hospital if they are sick, they buys them medicines that they can't pay them, they massage them with a balm who exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, is arrived at a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui who has a joghty person) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"" "Yes, yes," "" "He answered with a smile." "" "I really feel that there is very nice women because African women are very nice." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very lovingly affectionately.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the heart of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very well here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels to Boston with his sister who hopes to return to Boston, to find out there their husband and three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans, who are on the way into the United States, normally a first stop in South America and then move towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other way accompanying them by Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He told that Haitians and the Africans often travel to the route and that Afrikaner is already talking to Whatsapp by Ms. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">How many of his journey did Michelet lived in Brazil, and worked as a construction worker in construction sites of the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weakened, he started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been guest in Mama Africa since months: it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will contact Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our Mother and we never let them go back," "" "answer he smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells us that their guests are often sending its often text when they continued to report them, or to report their journey over the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It explains that you be Christian faith of the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but their guests have taught you to prepare chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. Ramírez is perhaps well-known, but it is not the only sparks hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, a cul de sac leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Valenzuela and his family was included in this winter.</seg>
<seg id="1938">"" "he is policeman and has found that the Bustets are sold to a lot of African migrants." ""</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleeping on the ground, but at least they have electricity, washing machine and cooking outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I have lived in the United States," "" "he tells." "" "I have experienced what she experience." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I have crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was deported to a raid on his work place from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels across Tapachula, comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that in Honduras with his wife and his three children fled to people who wanted to press money without a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked for a accommodation, and an unknown, a sole drawing, has offered him a roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives and try to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the corridors consume the traveler quietly their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A small bus has arrived today and has 20 new guests, most of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. Ramírez seems happy about that her house is full, but they are nostalgic, because of those who went away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she blossoms her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair braids, which you made a customer, some photos of their grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and elderly.</seg>

<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the mobile users of the Tianshan District of the City of Urumqi received a mobile phone, where she has to install the District government, a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web purification").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message is said that the app will" "" "get access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But unfortunately, the authorities also use the app for more than combat terrorism.</seg>

<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is the blocking of pornographic websites, from online fraud, trousers and Phishing pages to make users attentive to you how much time they spend online, and to control the own home network.</seg>

<seg id="1971">An app with these features can be used in a variety of course.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote actors or even hacker could be able to tamper the home network of a person or steal it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While the news about digital censorship in China are mostly concentrated on the experiences of users in the major cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote, oppressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme poverty and surveillance measures as well as routinely Internet connection.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media-based media outlet "images from the China" (b), the censored news published in China, showed photos of a Checkpoint, at the policemen who had been randomly checked if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you arrive at a Checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Embarallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, free expression of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Embarallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Embarallam Hdaib gets the majority of its time inside; times he moves to his screen, next to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">What one can rely on, is a cigarette between his fingers or his people with nicotine stained lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the chief of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year, in which Israel had forced his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs were forced to escape from their village in Palestine, where she lived as fellows (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For now six years Hdaib is an passionate active activist, who has transferred the conservative majority muting and their old proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and free expression of opinion by art and rapesmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music that deals with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian geploughing, but also demands the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues will not only be found in Amman's home town, but also in cities, from Damascus to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted by borders, and he can feel according to their own statement with the people who have suffered under the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he did not open it, he complain about US American foreign policy, a special ascent.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in a studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib doesn't believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, anything that was to do with his identity as "Palestinian gearing of the second generation" - as he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own living circumstances," emphasises Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think," "" "I think a man," "" "while he smashed into two cups," "" "it is the holy month of Ramadan. in this time it is foreseen for Muslims from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">Moreover, the Jordanian law also states that the consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Apparently, Hdaib has a certain weakness for it to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sensuous was called little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Fundamentally speaking the pieces of warm coffee and the buckles of the Kent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky, especially if one raises a look into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan water - to do not work in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan published a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary elections that support the Muslim Brotherhood - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontal Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">In an interview with CNN, the deputies and former spokesman of the Islamic Coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, said the concert "just because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"" "many" "" "in addition, the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world may be dangerous activism, which provides the old legitimacy's authoritarian regimes in the entire region." ""</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement issued Mashrou'Leila, the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," which still decided to use for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not easy-to-be-silk rhetoric, but actually a clear-crystallized reality in Jordan is clearly reflected in Hdaibs work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib traditional sex standards in the body by which he formed his vision by the fate of Arab women, the vorehelichen sex have formed.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the Skeleton of a apparently unfamiliar woman whose arms and legs stretch back to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">She is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of innumerable women who lost their lives by the hands of those who should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years in Jordan, the number of "Honmoring" has increased - the inofficial outside left.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to human Rights Watch, human Rights Watch reached its climax in 2016; however, Jordan was still missing that Jordan was missing the institutional infrastructure to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence to provide appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law for breaking control in 1954, women who are exposed to danger of domestic family violence, "and for their release, often an annual bureaucratic expense as well as the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs makes a great popularity and is known to be known as we are not afraid of themes as tablou in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib suggests that his work is politically, however, is that he is able to split his music that is full of expiry regarding sexuality, freedom and expression of expression, cannot be split by politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I was distrained politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed", Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" there is a focus on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of the songs that are politically in the core of politically.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is often repeated:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and any other is it too."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the other course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, in which one can get what you want, "- is faith or non-believe, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that hardly any man speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and lesbians, and that comments for the gender equality of LGBTQ + individuals were strongly censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib led an interview for the popular jordan Onlineage program Roya in order to note that his comments from context was torn, rotates and his opinion was censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded to Youtube without cuts, but only a modified version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib said openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals disagree with Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuvo, a poets of the eighth century, who still remained in memory thanks to its homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: when Abu Nuvo, which later should work on the order of the potassium, in the eighth century should write openly about homosexuality, why do Jordanians cannot do this?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The actual problem, such as Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila, or the fact that the concert has been cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the fascist kingdom there is nothing new, that the government is sanctioned to free expression, and that progressive votes will be put to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service held several former government officials and members of the teaching association, with the grounds that they had criticised their problems in social media, linked to the deeply in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of what is the concert of Hdaibs, only the top of the iceberg - the real challenge is to work a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanier.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a representative and take. Jordan has promised aashrou'Leila now for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - so it sees Hdaib - is of slow, afflictions and intra change. it is sure that these changes will be held in the heart of the Jordanian Society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He dreamed not only to bring his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region, through music, art and literature, is a real and basic openness, and not through bombs, warfare, and on artificial way to run democracies. at least, he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Even so far, Hdaib will continue to continue and therefore resistance can also be resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was supported by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belongs as a student Fellow.</seg>

<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta Festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many opponents. another theory has been delivered and come from one time, in the armies from the west of Japan in the Northeast, to forcing the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, into the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could give us a few great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can only imagine hard, how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint centre in the capital city, Meguro Gajoen, organised a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been watching the Meguro Gajoen again for long time: two pageons are just visible.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people, who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival will be the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, external appearance and body care so important as in this history, because it help them to keep the Peruvian youth from the criminality and to promote a legitimate profession as the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important port, located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic centre of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street raub and illegal drugs are daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 was that 51.5 percent of the population of this region should not feel certain.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - how many other food and South American countries - an increasing demand for men's aesthetic services.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance, and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has resulted in the experienced hands of hairdressers to form the complex hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the ultimate borders of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event inspired by the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts each other to show, who can create the eccentric Looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos about current competitions there is on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to discuss their weapons against hairdresser tools and to obtain a training in the hairdresser art, which makes it possible to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the potential opportunities, dozens of young people saw that they can seize a profession, which is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">At the beginning of March, the school offered special educational workshops and reported about some of their achievements:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district, which we are very proud, because of love to the children we have built this education community.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the revised version of" "" "love messages to guerrilla struggles," "" "published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is there not much more important, people who feel extinct, affection the affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question went to the two young Colombian activists of the BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios by the Young-Youth Foundation (letters to Reconciliation), young people encouraged to write guerrilla fighters letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only before short, their country was the scene of a historical event, and they wanted to help their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had closed a peace agreement with the guerrilla Movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered the signatory of the peace agreement as it was so important that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, in front of the columnern there is still a long way until one can speak of real conciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "" "" "Guerrilla murders who lived in illegal camps for many years were subjected to a war rhetoric and around the clock their weapons had to settle for the life as civilians." ""</seg>
<seg id="2190">In turn, the Colombian society turn to life in perpetual fear and in some cases of deep hatred compared to guerrilla fighters, and now have to support them into their rows, and support them when creating a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian convinced that the young columnist would have to close together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly what did they do: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them again in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The Campaign of Campaign are 6900 letters - one of each former guerrilla fighters who will then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for Reconciliation was created at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize, who took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there were Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to talk with Kailash Satyarthi who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This stated that we love the people who love to write on Valentine's Day of thousands of love letters, but those who need to need them much more necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He said he continued, in this year, he told his love with people who needed the most urgent prudent.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, which now have to find their place in society and create a new life. "the letters are ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to date, more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought that someone would be forgiven '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camp in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation BogotArt traveled into the camp to transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC rely on how they had done earlier in order to meet the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no commands, but letters full of entrepreneurial people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very eventual moment for all involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything that was between", telling the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governors of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After having passed the letters, a former fighter hit by the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambook" (a kind of hut, who live in the guerrilla fighters), I saw a guerrilla fighters who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to enter, because in addition to him on the bed was a MGL-pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the village.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said," "" "Hi, what do they just do?" "" "he said," "" "I will answer a letter which someone has written me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "" "" "never in my life, someone has something like something so nice," "" "therefore I answer it." "" "I ran my tears upon the cheeks." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely, and set me beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for war, I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful fellow of this struggle, and to help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life as war. the FARC joined him, the only possibility to store him and his six brothers before the starvation. "I have never thought that someone would forgive myself for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">"" "" "" "but now I know that there is a company without a society that awaits us with the open arms." ""</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned about how I have to handle weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and dignity in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the start of students, students and some of the FARC joined a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as war and the FARC already formed in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leader of the FARC the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views over the peace process: "many years have experienced, how we have the opportunity to develop us to a political party, we can help us to promote the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this order, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people had never found but never found hearing, and know that people who have seen often seen as monsters, and even so hate people with beautiful poems, who were shot through their habitats and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, where the country lives, is hurt to me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">"" "but it comfort me that all men, who killed and have done so much harm to us, and give us a smile and a hug." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answers to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the archbishop of the city Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The column was made that after the disarmament would rule peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it gives inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are prepared to hold weapons and protesting for their rights. this is also entirely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We are at the FARC now on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call every defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology belong to them - to rise over all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, our contribution and bring victims, because we know of our own experience that nothing is simple. of those who defend itself as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be forthcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way we will give it many obstacles, but we will overcome them together.</seg>

<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had to get everything and scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two stitch in my right lung wings.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which hospitals were you laid - in whom are men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, there is still my male name; but the physician got up and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">For this I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office, I got it with the fear; it was a muslific, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned himself as a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has respectfully with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, and wrote me - relatives, stranger, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightlife.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded that I would send me to Chechnya, in order to prove that everything was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They set absurd demands: some said to me, I would prove it to prove it up without through the streets; others wanted that I did not change my sex, that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have a grain size C - what should I say in television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people spoke to my mother at the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world, not only your family, but the entire Republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we can't touch you because you're a devout woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she laid a snare around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">The neighbours therefore came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window a car with darkened window discs and a number plate with a 95 windows.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it was clear that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-makers checked the numbering boards - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons, I don't want to give her name, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I still cannot realize how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it, without registration, without identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw her into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Got on and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "in the moment, when I wanted to call my mother by Whatsapp, I got a message:" "" "you don't believe that you're in safety, just because you have left the country?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know, in which hotel you can use. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only in order to prove you: it is the number 115" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This actually was my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about sexual activity, but this is a tobacco theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I always bear some traditional casian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much i wish I to overcome this seelic barrier can't be overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to violate them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">If we work with the camera, I actually give me effort to look like the person who reminds us of their past - so to my male shape.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I have submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For whom I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke with someone who fed into Argun in one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan have no humans arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he completed a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"" "" "" "with that, I probably unload the relations, they take care of the problem with the concerned person and in the end request a proof that the so-called" "" "honor" "" "has experienced by blood." ""</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now imprisoned in these secret places now?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says, it's not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or left out of their relatives have dropped to Kadyrows's court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be held there, so that they can present later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be slain, they will show their bodies in television and assert them to attack any village or military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply vanished, but specifically underdipped themselves to relocalize.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now only a mutation or have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just hit someone who was one and a half month in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people had disappeared in this prison after their growth had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new of them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was not taken away when these people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">However, until now they were not introduced as bandits, there were yet no reports yet. however, we suggest that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">"" "" "" "why should it not allow this man to shave to shave?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if this traceability and deduction of people who have a so-called "non-traditional" orientation, already found in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always contributed my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I believe before 2003 I was already known throughout Grozny when I still lived there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia had applied, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much more secure than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia originally wanted to introduce ourselves to the "civilian", but finally thrown us into the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were faded, I had dyed lashes, carried out tube jeans and short tail.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of the Sharia has never seen me only a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met with me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew it. they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We never were insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a speeching: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "spotte is not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say often to children, if they are talking about sick people.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so did they simply shut up their eyes before you, because they believed you would be sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: Yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never fails, and never struck.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long kept this Gnadensing time?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long, to Kadyrow came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about Moral in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not over us by se, but above the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel like people in the city started to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had wavered and prospered, looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I was able to feel like the situation in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: which activities are you going to go after?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waiter.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communitiers with them as a sort of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize Teacreffs, together, I gifted her to the hospital and help them to get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no penny for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered those people themselves, when I fluked refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and would like to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Cameron?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is alant.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So is the nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">"" "this is exactly the same as the Chechens who prophesied before you with foam in front of the mouth that there is no weakness in them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2385">Those who have those who have Kabardiners who have the Russians have also known; on the whole planet it is - but not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">I am coming from there, so it's not pleasant to hear some kind.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque and fasted during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know, many think of transideity to men who love men, and they believe that man changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but this is a Trusteer.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of senses to be exact, different living settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin, and don't be ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I don't have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Do I'm sorry that I am here so personally, but my last intime relationship is already longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad about that - I don't know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2411">The region, most of which is located in the Iran-living Arab Ahwazi community, was severely shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to cross the native Arab population to conquer their habitat.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In front of a century, the Arab Awaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took over power and received great efforts to finish the ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>

<seg id="2414">Despite this valuable resources, the regional economy continues to grow slowly, and the native population gets only little of this wealth.</seg>

<seg id="2418">These demumes have only led to destroy the devastation in the region by dryness, and to destroy local agriculture and fish and palm trees.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi-youths rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian director for cooperation, work and social welfare, told that 5% of the ancestors of Ahwazis who finished in primary school, completed 55% a secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>

<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I'm not a feminist, many women - especially white women who refer to themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustrating feminists.</seg>

<seg id="2441">"" "" "" "that women are still under stringent observation," "" "if they are doing so, what they are doing with her body." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sojourn or later in various areas of life on a glass ceiling, and that discrimination based on gender is still across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I am sick of twice and twice among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And nonetheless, if I have to talk to skin color, on black Cis women, on black women from the Diaspora; if I say that we have been physically affected by racism and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists have been abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, all agree that women - all women should come together to raise "their voices to" their voices and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing the equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">"" "" "" "but they don't want to speak that it is in addition to sexualised violence an institutionalized form of assimilated violence, which we are exposed to black women on two times." ""</seg>

<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background to the school are regarded as a white girl, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spyars and women have been exposed to a higher risk to suffer from domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">In one hand, I want to have all the women, all the men, and at all the same rights, nor any skin of skin. on the other hand, I cannot consider myself as a black woman; in whose centre the white woman is to consider, unjust to consider unjust to do justice in their mind as well as to the skin color of a person.</seg>

<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever, that we can define the black women to our own ideas and give us into the sphere, which will be created for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism (about: Africa-Womanism) says that we can defend ourselves to our own kind. and not only that - black women can be honourable in this way, in which the cultural, mental, seelic, physical and even the spiritual elements can be honourable, which make the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately called separatism and exclusion, after they have read these lines, I think about the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can lift up black women and women from other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognised as part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and my life as part of this paradigm.</seg>

<seg id="2487">In general, if women shall be reimbursed at all, they do not receive any support by the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent of men, which they harassed. this explains why only 20% of all women to admit victims of violence to be victims of violence at all.</seg>

"there are different information and reports that indicate the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," explained them.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is only rarely or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">For the necessary medical research, there are two reasons: for a lack of medical research, many medicines and vaccines, which cover the special medical requirements on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in the poorest countries of Africa far more gravitate consequences than elsewhere, and lack of investments in the investigation of these diseases are a great problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists, organises its own research capacity in Africa. a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the Central Center of Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic, first engraved on the national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched on HIV virus before being decided to go back home to support the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">Global Voices discussed Dr. Warrier about the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstanding of the media about these research.</seg>

<seg id="2599">Ranjit WarriRW: at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results. I support the samic national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just rigid a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>

<seg id="2602">How do they distinguish themselves from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we are only able to rely on solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always remain the receiver instead of ourselves.</seg>

<seg id="2610">The projects are funded differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or draw here, for financing and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>

<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: basic infrastructure is not equal to the standards in developed countries. it costs lots of money, a continuous supply with electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: how is the opinion of public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interested, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how big is your opinion according to the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I've seen great students of all age classes.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are need for special scientific training, beginning in every age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social science, computer science, big data, research in the cosmopolitan, healthcare (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa from western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often there are limited speed, things to do, and the resulting access to scientific expertise that represent the challenges here.</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers produce global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This contribution of Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the site Ensia.com, a magazine which reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has already been active in the USA for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 types of varieties, such as Outreddish, the first plant, cultivated by NASA Astronauts in space and has been consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Mortons work only through its own influences and the question as many salateries can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more salads were patented, and that he could not continue to use it.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual types, but also for certain properties like resistance to diseases, a special red or green or glued sheets.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years more such patents have been filed for ever more plants such as cereal or cartons. due to this trends, plant breeding and experts for food security ensure food production in the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representatives of a millennia old tradition, Morton always loved ads, but he now needs longer, because his work will always be worth further restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is, when a rock mugs should lie in a river where I must wishing them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "therefore we have to do this now, but it is a fraction with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents are to go far away." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they keep court here, no one can pass a new ointments, because all features are already patented. "he makes so good as possible and try to find those features which he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and endeavoured to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined one movement, which is always greater in the USA and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Room station ISS have red Roman salat the Sorte Outreddish in the "greenhouse" station, and eaten. there we tested whether plants be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is not a coincidence that this name sounds like that the movement from the IT field would come and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open Source" seed) is inspired by the movement for free "Open Source" software, which provides alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">She was founded in order to ensure that some plant types and genic are not protected as intellectual property and are used for plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, a short Ossi called Ossi, US breeder can also undertake that others can freely use them from them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not do that they can't make business with their seed into business and sell it. "open source" breeders allow only others to prevent their seed, and not exhend their own varieties - two aspects which are forbidden and prescribed by many plants.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Scaffed prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">In the emeritus Professor of Wisconsin's Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seed and the possibility to make new plants, both important for nutrition security as well as for environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed also plays a role in larger relations such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter, not only little to use by being seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "Open Source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, Corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological farming, and not to buy our goal of ecological sustainability, as such as it is offered on farms, should also know that the way is cultivated, like this vegetables, is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Dietary change without seed sovereign is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed initiative do not undertake to provide other seed solutions to others. thus, their occurrence in contrast to seeds, seed and plant features are to be patented.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argued that the future of food supply is vulnerable because the available pool due to the increasingly popular property rights of property rights, which is always restricted to limited, unabduction casual.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, has involved in her PhD with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found out that approximately one third of all box features are protected as intellectual property which is either not only usable for plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates are not yet, but experts such as Luby guards that measure resided plants such as wheat into even greater style are patented as a salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visions</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants become so farmed that they have targeted traits - of such that their taste or their color improves up to such, due to them in certain environments, and threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders caused by ever more patents. genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever before, as the changed conditions caused by climate change much worse than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto know that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsantos activities. with a total of four co-banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States set itself the company for the conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, you contradicted that intellectual property may promote other breeders, since "patents and the protection of plant varied innovations." "a patent is basically taken out, once the patent is expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method for the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such a protection has been inhibited to innovation, but promotes the public more material and know-how are provided." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton requires the different: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, leave certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">"" "" "" "and if they have been waiting to wait for plants that are adapted to plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the struggle." ""</seg>
<seg id="2669">But the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good, and it should remain even better: "independent plant eders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetical incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what makes us antitement, and it is impossible to use it, if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton defaults to the concept to patenting the plant features: "we do not really create the characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them from and as a grower, we finally have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and Ossi-board, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who calls for care of his own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large courts and monocultures, which are needed for the cultivation of herbicide, needs to be found in his varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is perfectly geared. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto are) patents are able to survive the most smaller seed companies, even without patents, or keep it too expensive or so it is not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeding Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden Salad.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeder is by the Avoid of plant's innovative, "it looks like that I can produce new efforts to produce new, stronger than companies.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need a new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitor will be able to sell my varieties in a couple of years, "says he." with a patent one is 20 years before competition, with which one makes it very nice. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">"" "although the U.S. seem to be leading to the" "" "Open Source" "", "the concept has now spread quickly around the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture,"), which is itself as a professional organization in the area of resources, is a "open source" seed organization cooperate with farmers and helps them to combine new varieties that fulfill the specific requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seed to come and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German Organization Agreates works on an "open source" license which ultimately takes a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeder in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(requirements for the breed differ from country to country, for the Ossi obligation not simply could be taken over one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally cultivated plants should not be patented. thus, they are against the present practice of the European Patent, which permits patents in the conventional plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">"" "" "" "there is no law nor the law; now it is to bring to the governments of the Member States to implement the Patent Office to implement this new line." ""</seg>

ANHRI was not so important that all technical options have been exhausted, in order to overcome the sperm, and not to admit it. we hope to meet our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites of 21 websites, such as the independent news page MADA Masr, arabic-language issue of the Huffington Post and the Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2733">His article turn mainly around politics and the human rights of human rights in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment Ziada expressed himself in the lock through the government and reflected the reflected this means:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs is very old, however, has priority priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is, however, it is of two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It is able to give me the feeling of a siege to me; an arrest, an attempted murder, unloading at the national Security Council, the sperm blogs, and any other web page, for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I wrote not in vain. in other words, my words have an effect if also only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was a archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to the post of articles to handle the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, after they have blocked him, and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way up to the end.</seg>

<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday the 12th of June we knew how the sperm of web sites that VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a such practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and filter to access the Egyptian users.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day for day reports in Brazil with huge headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>

<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a forced financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio was the highest level since 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice had called for the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports about these are everyday and this is inacceptable & # 8212; you will find at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "so the report published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio" "" "Extra Day on August 16," "" "This is not normal," "" "in which she announced, a new section called" "" "war in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on a crime that happens in each capital of the world, such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything that happens in Rio, will be published in the category "War in Rio." (...) This is our kind to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we didn't close our eyes before the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video which was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedean, chief editor of the newspaper, told that this decision was no occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper in all over the world with a war ruin in a country that doesn't recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper was declared that according to the Institute for Internal Safety in Rio de Janeiro 843 areas, a journalist are controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial department the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">"" "" "" "we deliberately aware that a war-discourse, if he is distorted," "" "the police, the police, who shoots only and then asks questions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and their partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Is the term "war" more than they profit?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argued the journalist in Cecília Oliveira, the violence as "war" to describe the media and could make it harder, responsible for the police to the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - such as Extra at the analysis of the military rates in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, Enlightenment and a historic and self-counterfading of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">According to Cecília, according to Cecília, the Rio de Janeiro is false: "22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are located according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the most recent available data.</seg>

<seg id="2780">An extra of the company Globo, the largest media company South America, is emphasised as Cecília, has repeated the security policy of the Staats for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">One of these security policy measures also belonged to the founding of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificora), a police unit, which was set in 2003 by deployment of a massive police bed for a Favela of police and to stationing a unit permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2782">At the beginning of this fact, the UPP has actually led to a decrease of violent deaths. since some years, the UPP was forced to protect against militants and repression against the poor municipalities that actually should protect the Neo-created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux originates from one of his articles from 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "Civil War."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for men.</seg>
<seg id="2786">"" "for this demands the state to go, means and paths, which are typical for a war." "" "this is an unsharp point in the landscape and the object for" "" "collation damage" "" "and" "" "unlocked balls" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2890">At that time, the life of Afghan refugees were characterised by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really hard," "" "Asharaf recalled in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the site where we worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no heating there, no heating. we hanged nylon in front of the open window, so that we do not tumours at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Ashark left his life without papers in Iran, and made for the trip to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">At the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum request, Asharaf returned to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Ashark homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, close to parks and went to a church that divided twice a day in helpfulness.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy due to relatively high reference quotas is a kind of chance for asylum seekers. it is true, however, that conditions, asylum seekers can be found in the country, catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation of Civil liberties Union for Europe writes, the system is suffering from a general lack of transparency.</seg>

<seg id="2900">According to Italian Law, asylum seekers only can be assigned to a recording center, when it officially set an application for asylum - what you can go on after the registration of the asylum request.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money to have accommodation, either to the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unwronged way of life helped Asharaf to liberate himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having made several years working in construction industry, Asharaf moved his entire creation in the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while still a second hostel and a snakeiss opened.</seg>

<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates, approximately 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
