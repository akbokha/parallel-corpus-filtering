this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him maybe because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times in New York Times .
long before som@@ ebody had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen , wrote a book in which he is spectacular that the N@@ SA have illeg@@ ally heard of the Americans of the Americans .
but there is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression .
in this he describes a disast@@ rous US intelligence operation , in which the CIA was literally over for a nuclear bomb .
if the crazy sounds , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know what the chapter doesn &apos;t like at all ?
the US government .
for nearly 10 years the government filed under R@@ isen and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he became the symbol for the design of the government , W@@ hist@@ leb@@ ars to condemn and journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to use this right , if media do not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the bra@@ ve , they will be priced .
so when the government disp@@ at@@ ched with R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ ageous repor@@ ters had already done before him : he refused , and said that he would rather go into prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was so with the risk to go to prison .
but then , only days before the process , there happened something unusual .
suddenly , though they were important for years , it were essential for their case , the government demands were dropped to R@@ isen .
reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the repor@@ ters and sources can always hide .
instead of f@@ ailing and ra@@ is@@ ans , they could carry out his digital foot@@ steps for him .
and so the investig@@ ator have , without his understanding , to be concerned his telephone approach to his phone ,
equally as its e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his l@@ ending information , and even travel information with the list of its flights .
among those information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , the CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and ris@@ ens .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower at his presence , but the justice voted more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how to be a problem , especially because the government wants to take much of their work as a home .
since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of which a W@@ hist@@ leb@@ ars went to a journalist .
so we have to set the press work to the game that is to be protected by the first constitutional complaint , because the government has more possibilities to make any more .
but just as technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of repe@@ ats , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
and indeed , they can take advantage of the moment in which they contact , rather than in the night , in the witness level .
today , there are communication software that has not been written , as R@@ isen his book , and it is much more secure than ordinary E @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such technology is a Secure@@ Drop , an open source open system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet &apos;s most famous , which was developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , please go to a news website , such as the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send documents , as with any special contact form .
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the relevant news agency has access .
so the government cannot order any more information , and many of the information that would like it would not be available from the out@@ set .
Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole that protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments in all over the world are always new sp@@ ying technologies , who are all dangerous .
it is necessary to ensure that not only technology services such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to give abuse of abuse . it &apos;s just important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ ars ,
the more ab@@ used ab@@ normal@@ ities in the supply of soldiers who wants to report about survived hospitals . or to the next environmental workers , the alarm to negoti@@ ate water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a pilgri@@ m @-@ Insider , who war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies have not only been taken for those who want to un@@ cover crimes but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you for .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the largest data le@@ ck of the story was published . &#93; &#91; What does this mean , reveal that the rich and M@@ ighty &#93; have been hiding &#91; enormous money sum@@ s in tax ha@@ v@@ ases . &#93; &#91; What does this mean ? &#93; &#91; What does this mean ? &#93; this week we were signed by messages about a rectangle of 11 million documents of the Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca .
the publication of this documents have a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we will get an impression how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you setup this ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works .
this has led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has withdrawn .
also there are reports that a ban of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad bo@@ xy companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens has .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars on Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin will lead over a close friend from children &apos;s days , a famous C@@ elli@@ sts .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others , who are nervous to the next release , and to the next revealed documents .
now sounds like the plot of an agencies or a John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ ROM .
it seems that cri@@ es away from you , me , ordinary men .
why should us do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and mighty are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all of their taxes , then this means fewer funds for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ en@@ al .
in all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ases are used by a few few , to hide their wealth and to make sure what we have been discus@@ sing for ten years and un@@ veil .
I think , many people will be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how this tax ha@@ v@@ ases work .
I always imagine a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u .
so , one company has a firm in another company , in a further company which makes it nearly impossible to understand , who &apos;s behind this prayer .
it may be very difficult for prosec@@ utions and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what thing is .
I think it is interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
probably because there have been no prominent Americans that previously appeared in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not so that there is no rich Americans that you hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by the principle , after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
we would have a data le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands , or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States .
in fact , it is so that in some U.S. States less information needs to specify less information to set a company than to make a li@@ br@@ arian identification .
this kind of transparency in the USA allowed it to cut school children , school children .
it is allowed to zoom particularly vulner@@ able investors .
it is this kind of behavior which concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a covered investig@@ ator in the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as a afri@@ can minister , who wanted to bring money into the US to buy a yacht to buy a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked it , that all up to a lawyer made our investig@@ ator &apos;s proposals , how he could transfer his money .
these were all pre@@ pre@@ pre@@ tions . none of these lawyers received us as a client , and of course there was no man committed to that money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider that not as individual cases .
it is not going to have a single advoc@@ ate , who has exposed to our discovered investigations .
it is not about a single leader , wrapped in a sc@@ andal .
it &apos;s how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we must change the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must change the rules to make this type of behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is very well @-@ known , as if we could do anything , as if nothing could have changed ; as if there is always the rich and mighty .
but as bor@@ row@@ ed optim@@ ist , I really see that a lot has started to change .
in the past few years we have seen pre @-@ bre@@ aches to more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies .
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has been recorded in central regist@@ ers at national level , who is really behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US has left off .
representatives of both parties have contributed a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this makes no progress that we would like to see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would really like to see how this Panama &apos;s revel@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , as a means used to ensure greater transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who are mad when they see how other people can hide their real identity behind head@@ lights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need exec@@ utives in the economy that rise up and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need the leading politicians that recognize the problem and deplo@@ ying themselves through laws this type of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , we can finally quit the in@@ transparent , which allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing , finally finished .
this is the story , as I had almost kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das would be .
a day after I completed my design studies , I made a back@@ yard .
one type in the red Maz@@ da remained and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . after that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the invoice , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are you going to pray today ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just didn &apos;t know him ! he says he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I don &apos;t have been kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
that &apos;s a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Save how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
night I was in bed , I got stuck to the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what was I b@@ lown up ?
a wild sleeping in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fri@@ ght that I rose from the bed , on the ti@@ ff at the door , and my sleep door closed .
but he was not mad .
we are still in touch .
the artwork , which he bought from me today is now on his class@@ room . he is teacher now .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my viewing angle .
perhaps the people who were sold in childhood as stranger , actually friends who were waiting for waiting to be discovered ?
people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
we make a short jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ a , my roommate attrac@@ ts and the rent is increased .
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe , creativity can make it possible to trans@@ form it in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new co @-@ inhabit@@ ant Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I &apos;ve found something to earn something . our apartment is equipped with a designer bed @-@ and @-@ Breakfast . young designer can lodge with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we created a website and so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it great , and we also .
I &apos;m sure that we tast@@ ed our cheese @-@ ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ amine completely different because we made it for our guests .
we t@@ oured them through the whole city . when we had ended our last guest leaving the door into the castle , Brian and I joined us .
we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and we &apos;ve been able to pay our rental ?
things came to the roll .
my former roommate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out whether you could make a business concept .
so we presented ourselves to the investors : &quot; we want to create a site in public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms , their doors one closes when visiting .
over the Internet , they can then invite all alien people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the miss@@ ile would have been kindled .
but did not do it .
no one who is still at consol@@ ation would invest in a business that allows a foreig@@ ner to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we all have learned children , strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you have to know about things that you can do well . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the whole experience .
we had learned objects , how to design objects , but now we wanted to create confidence , between humans who had never met before .
can design be so anything ?
is it possible to create with Design Trust ?
I would like to give you a sample sample , which degree confidence we asc@@ ended .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will en@@ force you out of your comfort one .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ lock mobile on your left seat .
this silent flight of pan@@ ic , which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door .
for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in the hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so do most guests feel when they are somewhere else .
only from this reason our company can exist .
only so , who now has Al Go@@ res mobile phone ?
could you declare to Twitter that he was president for the President of the President ?
you can now return the phones now .
they have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I want to tell you some discover@@ ies .
what if we have changed a small detail in this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor could only be presented with his name ; if he tells how he comes , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine , you have 150 Be@@ aches that all say : &quot; he can really hold a very well @-@ locked cell phone ! &quot;
how would you feel when using your mobile phone ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a well @-@ called feedback system strengthens confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was difficult for the people , negative faces .
ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest published their convic@@ tions , before we set them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined , as probably it is that people trust each other , depending on how they are in terms of age and housing .
little surprising we trust the people most , which are most similar .
the more differences we find , the less trust we trust .
this is a natural social Vo@@ re@@ engineers .
it is exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by Be@@ ur@@ ity@@ .
if one has less than three issues , nothing changes .
however , one has more than ten , changing everything .
a good call of simil@@ ar@@ ities .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted suburbs .
in addition , we discovered that confidence is dependent on how much one is in the price .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if one tells little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
tells you much as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &apos;s -- -- the request is also not accepted .
so there &apos;s an optimal level of open@@ ness , for example &quot; Great art works in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing with my family vacation . &quot;
how to create it with design , to produce this degree of Open@@ ness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics should be something to write .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces from a strange woman .
with which we did not reck@@ oned , the great amount of people who were more than ready to lay these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people are entitled to take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
secon@@ dly : the un@@ ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a demand that was not covered before@@ hand .
the shop is running very good for us .
of course there are times , if not everything is smooth .
there were guests that allow un@@ lawful part@@ ys celebrated or dwellings devast@@ ated .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly on my mobile phone .
I stood in front of the front when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than this calls . it &apos;s already hurt if I only think .
the dis@@ appointment that one hears in the voice of the bond , and will always be our biggest motivation to improve our further motivation .
fortunately , only a fra@@ ction of 123 million had only a fra@@ ction of the nights .
for people confi@@ ded to right to right .
when confidence works , it is possible to emer@@ ge .
one of our guests enjoyed vacation in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his hosts drove him into the hospital .
he even sp@@ ends blood for the necessary surgery !
here is its assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers that tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra is genuine protected gel that save a life even though they don &apos;t know it properly .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass .
because they don &apos;t want it to be sol@@ itary , they bring books over .
you can even stay longer without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , of course not every stay .
but these relations behind the pure cash transaction are exactly what you want to reach with the share economy .
when I stum@@ bled on this concept for the first time , I asked :
how does the idea of the partial with monetary transactions combined ?
it comes to a economic market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to call it just . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade and human relationships promises .
people create a part of itself , and that changes everything .
if one travels nowadays , it is efficient with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what would be if travelling a rich buffet from local single press ?
what would be , if in each place you visited , a group there would wait there , a group there would be a thoroughly complete and one at a circum@@ cise area of which one has never heard ;
or if you want to learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to make apartments of reason to participate ?
what would that look like ?
what would be if cities would assume the common part of the common share ?
I set up cities which allow us society and relations , instead of sol@@ itude and dis@@ closure .
in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . lots of parking places , which belonged to the government ,
were now offered to residents . students who were looking for a stay ,
were medi@@ ated to people whose children were gone out . the incubation period were launched ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even hosting .
so the idea seems to be so crazy , as it was brought to us .
we have not invented the wheel .
hospitality also gave it before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why has just done our works ?
apart from luck and timing we knew that one can find the right design with the existing trust .
design can help us to overcome deep@@ ening advantages .
I think that is amazing ,
ideal for overwhelming .
I have to think about it if a red Maz@@ da goes on me .
we of course , that design can not solve every problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for design shortly .
thank you for .
what do you think if you watch me ?
a bel@@ i@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , a brain under@@ wear , a terror cr@@ ist ?
or just a delay in the airport of safety at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the debt for your negative impressions .
so the media represent the media , so look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans mean , most would not know Muslims .
presumably the people don &apos;t speak with their u@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never learned a Muslim : it &apos;s great , you know .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- two es@@ pres@@ so , with wh@@ ipped cream extra .
I am married ,
a Mö@@ ch@@ te@@ ous @-@ Fitness fan@@ ati@@ an ,
and I am a practi@@ cing , spiritual Muslim .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so .
I decided to decide .
when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual man , as some of my friends , but as the Muslim . I decided to bear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
my femin@@ ist friends were un@@ composed : &quot; why don &apos;t you handle yourself ? &quot;
the L@@ ust@@ y was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , namely , compared to the print that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , I felt a perfect and un@@ achiev@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have del@@ ays with the Quran .
I read it , thought to question , doub@@ ted and believed finally .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was confidence and slow dev@@ otion , which deep@@ ened together with every reading of the Kor@@ an .
the beauty of rhyth@@ mi@@ k brings me sometimes to weeping .
I know myself . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that som@@ ebody takes you to perc@@ eive you completely , and som@@ eh@@ ow love you ?
so it feels .
later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was sitting in my kitchen , looked at the end , looked at the screen and looked at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eil@@ aling &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flo@@ ated in buildings , people don@@ ors from the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock walked quickly in emp@@ t@@ ance .
why should one do anything ?
I switched to the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists &quot; ... , &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ hadi@@ st ... &quot; ... &quot; K@@ ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; st@@ icky M@@ ec@@ ca ! &quot;
O my God .
it is not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u related to me the works of others from a civil war into a susp@@ ects .
the same day we had to go through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new town and begin with the post@@ graduate course .
I remember , as I was silent -- when we were silent -- then deep things went into my seat , and I feared the first time to be recognized as the Muslim .
we moved to our apartment in this night in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ye be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lead in well lit up &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week in indoor .
then there was Friday in that week -- the day , on which Muslims are gathering together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not work on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage of coverage .
the feelings were un@@ mist@@ ak@@ ably about , and I heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who had stayed for Muslims , and struck in free .
there were really bran@@ dan@@ ces to mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt really wrong .
because the people who had attacked this land had attacked our country .
I won the anger of the people on the terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
they are the ap@@ ologies that are hard .
today , we can actually hear people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when are we going on ? &quot;
some people want to compare Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as a tumor in the body of the United States .
only the question arises : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or good ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor just under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are like all the other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are inventor and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ el@@ fer and Olymp@@ ias .
will there be safe deposit of mos@@ ques in America ?
there may be a few parking spaces , but not stop the terror .
the regular visiting of a mosque leads to people other faith toler@@ ant , and greater participation .
and as a director of the police in Washington , DC recently told : people actually won &apos;t be radical in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ ated in their cellar or in front of a computer .
at the Radi@@ cal process you &apos;ve found that it starts out of their congregation , even by their family , so that the person believes the terror@@ ists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and their ide@@ ology , is a tra@@ itor or belief .
if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ ization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some are still asser@@ t that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS formulated its breeding with the Kor@@ an .
as the Muslim , as a mother , as a man , I think that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would then add to their pre@@ ference , if one recognize them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups announce their ide@@ ology , on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when you cast a look at her , she does not drives what they are in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Im@@ am told me a amazing story :
a girl came to him because they pre @-@ use to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radi@@ al religious leaders .
he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every gh@@ ost , with whom she spoke , brought her to silence , and said , her wrath , their sense for in@@ justice in the world , to bring it into trouble .
inspired by nothing , and something that had given birth to their rage , she was a main goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ ization by extrem@@ ists who promised to have a solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Im@@ am introduced the connection to God and their church . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead , instead of accused her rage , he showed their construc@@ tive paths for a real change in the world .
what she lear@@ nt at the mosque , kept them to join the IS .
that was a insight , as the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and my family affects .
but how does it work on normal Americans ?
how does it work on any other ?
how is the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day to our democracy on our freedom of thought ?
a study -- actually , several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear us , there will happen at least three things .
we rather accept an authorized government system , conformity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows : if you consider test persons messages which were reported negative on Muslims , they voted more military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
when you look , when the mood against Muslims moved up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terror attacks .
it happened in the ap@@ ron of Iraq and during two election periods .
so , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not just the natural reaction to the Muslim terror , as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool for manip@@ ulating the public to pay the foundation of a free society , the sensible and well informed citizens .
to deal with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear of us all .
in the assignment of collective education , it is not only thing to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both of them went to school .
de@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the most sweet man , that she knew her .
she visited him there , and he showed her cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um . she was bl@@ oss@@ om and said :
&quot; when is such an experienced young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne , her brother and his wife , her neigh@@ bor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , murdered her in the afternoon like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was born in the afternoon . he did it in her home , as opposed to Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times at De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism cannot be mor@@ ally mor@@ ally , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we passed to the mosque , or stayed safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not a slight decision because it went to America to let us do our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in whom we can freely prac@@ tise our religion .
we decided to join the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we drove silent , with high @-@ pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , my shoes went out , went into the building hall , and what I saw that he left me .
the hall was rest@@ less full .
then the Im@@ am made a announcement , because the half of the meetings were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but in order to attack us .
in that moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there , because they had courage and compassion on pan@@ ic and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism at the moment ?
are you going to go safe ?
or are you to connect my : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you beautiful !
Helen W@@ alia : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a Ner@@ ve .
but I ask myself , what do you say that you might claim a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a monument with dr@@ au@@ ght , so there is an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say you don &apos;t need . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
if you look at Muslims in all over the world , and I did that with the biggest ever carried out by Muslims in all over the world , people want to be normal things .
they want to be pro@@ sper@@ ity for the family , they want to work , and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way any exception .
if people appear like an exception , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : many thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what began as a platform for handic@@ ra@@ fts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands shortly before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . possible in research institutions around the world .
before the air package in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of air@@ crafts used in Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting you can reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space .
you can also build self @-@ loaded structures .
they learned to carry loads to deal with tur@@ bul@@ ences and are generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our goal is to exceed the bound@@ aries of the possible flight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so a system autonomous work , it needs to know collective sh@@ aving , where the mobile objects are located in the room .
at our lab at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alis@@ ing technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , calculations on board which should do the machine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available on the highest image . for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight device that tries to beat two flying with a f@@ lap .
like other star@@ ring , it is efficient , much more efficient as helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most powerful men , it can be flo@@ at , and thus has great advantages with start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a swe@@ eping page .
a limitation of rear devices is that they react sensitive to tur@@ bul@@ ences such as wind turbines .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it , it doesn &apos;t matter what position is able to re@@ att@@ ain the optimal position and improves performance through practice .
okay . okay .
during our research , we often provide basic abstract Questions that are led to the core of the matter .
one such question might be , for example : what is the small number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are about as machines , known as machines with a thousand movable parts that are to viol@@ ate you to viol@@ ate you .
decades ago , educated pilots could fly remote @-@ controlled flight devices , which only had two movable parts : one propeller and a stern th@@ ru@@ ster .
by far , we discovered that flies can work with just one .
this is the Mon@@ bu@@ inner , the mechanically sim@@ pl@@ est flight device . it was invented in a short time .
it has only a movable part , a propeller ,
no s@@ orts , hin@@ ge and trans@@ verse lines , no further positions or controllers , only one propeller .
although it &apos;s mechanically simple , it happens very much to fly in the interior , so that it can move stable in space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to flying , I must throw it exactly right .
the probability , to throw exactly correctly , if all see , is small , so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the Mon@@ bu@@ inner is an exercise in pleasure , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in over@@ flow .
what do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ rical .
therefore he is an ambi@@ val@@ ent in his orientation .
thereby he receives the most commonly accepted capability ,
in the room to move all directions , no matter how he rot@@ ates , or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot is shown in models , the rest is lear@@ ns directly at the fly .
let us see that .
when flying machines will be part of our everyday use , it must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate twin @-@ propeller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates in clock@@ wise
and the other against the clock@@ wise .
when one builds them , they are like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , a bit wrong -- a engine or propeller is falling apart , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine even if limited .
we will now demonstrate this , making a half @-@ air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic shafts .
the great number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a pallet on aesthetic expression .
we took usual micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and out@@ fit them with loc@@ alis@@ ing technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hop@@ efully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to reflect new revolutionary ideas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the particularly safe machine there is to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course it is difficult to predic@@ ting the influence of this technology .
for types such as us is the reward in development and work act .
it serves as a memory , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , wise @-@ wise to form them to shape this spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive and economic potential , the bag is on the i .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago in a very far distant galax@@ y two black holes each other in a very far distant galax@@ y , they walk the mass three times in a tenth part of pure energy .
this short moment is brigh@@ ter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe .
it was a very big kn@@ it .
but their energy they were not in the form of light free --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into space @-@ time ge@@ an even and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
arrange the events initially tim@@ ed .
1.3 billion years ago , a multi @-@ star life was created on Earth .
since then the Earth has brought quite a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Sau@@ rier , people and -- God stand up at -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly cour@@ ageous -- R@@ ai Weiss was decided by the MIT , K@@ ip Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- a huge laser detector that are searching for gra@@ vit@@ ic@@ ating black holes .
most people held it for crazy .
but enough people knew it as mad gen@@ ies , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after the decade development , design , conception and extremely hard work , they built the Det@@ ector L@@ IG@@ O : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ res of Gra@@ vi@@ ation Ob@@ servatory .
in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of L@@ IG@@ O was significantly increased , which significantly improved the detection performance .
therefore we call him Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
at the beginning of September 2015 , L@@ IG@@ O started to clari@@ fy some minor , persistent problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ation@@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ous black holes through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hug@@ hes : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the good@@ bye to my death sick .
it was basically the fruits of my life .
all this , what I worked , is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hug@@ hes , theoretical physi@@ cist at the MIT . he studied Gra@@ vit@@ ation@@ waves from black holes like L@@ IG@@ O meas@@ ur@@ able signals since 23 years . but what are Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ation wave is a cr@@ us@@ ement of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its whole content will be stretched in one direction and stretched out into the other .
at the illustr@@ ative theory , lecturer in courses for the rel@@ ativity is often a correct dance .
&quot; stretching and dust , stretching and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , are ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
on the 14th of September , for example , each of us stretched out the waves and stretched . stretching of an average human being was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st of this way , the L@@ IG@@ O members is mad for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , and this is already ab@@ sur@@ d , the length would have to be measured at less than an thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear core . that is neutral .
at the end of his classic text on grav@@ itation
described by K@@ ip Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , hunting after the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties during the construction of such detectors are tremend@@ ous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cist are fin@@ der@@ ive and with the support of the public will overcome all obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was published in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott claims , L@@ IG@@ O would be more an ear than one eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavelength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phones .
that &apos;s quite practical . for so , you can just@@ ify a picture or a map of things by taking the of several points that you can perc@@ eive you .
if it is different , it is different .
sounds tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
therefore , it is very hard , actually impossible to produce a picture of things which are particularly much :
the face of your child approximately .
instead , we wait for certain characteristics such as clay and level , rhythm and volume to close to the history behind .
&quot; now Alice &quot; speaks just Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob she breaks out . &quot;
&quot; stup@@ id Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ation waves .
we can do with them no easy pictures of objects in all .
but having regard to changes in am@@ plitude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least , the measured frequencies are at least for L@@ IG@@ O .
so if we can convert wave pattern in Sh@@ all , we can hear the universe .
the grav@@ itation of gravity can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , where my colleague Scott has already busy very long .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , zir@@ cons simply : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two body very quickly , you hear the same pair of cir@@ cl@@ ings with an additional tone change . this sounds like : W@@ u @-@ proof @-@ read @-@ highlights !
it is a type of movement pattern , shaped in the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that I never forget -- heard L@@ IG@@ O the following : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des Sp@@ ush &#93; ) heard this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 times of solar mass , which are about as fast as the st@@ aves of your sh@@ aker .
AA : we over@@ lay ourselves short what this means .
two black holes , the di@@ ch@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns revol@@ ve per second , before they were col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these powers .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
this is the remaining meaning of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O is net a completely new way to expl@@ oring the universe , as it was never before .
in this way we can listen to the All and the invisible .
we can &apos;t see much in all , -- practically , or in principle --
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ole stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . of them we have learned about all things .
the exciting physical processes are done , but in the core , the behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon hidden .
we will never see , because these op@@ ak are .
engraving waves of iron , as it would be transparent glass . the Ur@@ th@@ ora : I would like mad about the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see that the jung@@ le is covered by his own neigh@@ bor .
thanks to gra@@ vit@@ ation waves , it should be possible to re@@ location up to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that we have never seen that all things we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of whom we &apos;re not able to discover that we can only discover that we listen .
in fact , L@@ IG@@ O was right in the first attempt of things that we had not expected .
my colleague at the MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says to this topic : ME : the kind of stars that watches the black holes , such as L@@ IG@@ O observed , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so@@ iling for our archaeological work .
L@@ IG@@ O enables us to make a completely different viewing angle to the events in all , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be so cour@@ ageous as you can only be possible .
thanks to L@@ IG@@ O we know how to create great Det@@ ectors , and the lar@@ v@@ ae of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new ob@@ servatory -- a brand new generation of ob@@ servatory on Earth and all .
for what could be more beautiful than the jung@@ le himself ?
now the time of great dreams .
dreams with us .
thank you for .
some time ago I tried a experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one year long I would say to all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of whom I feared me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter whether it got me nervous that brought me into un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me &quot; Yes . &quot;
would I speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
wanted to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
would I start playing with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly that to do , w@@ ov@@ or I feared me , I think my anxi@@ ety .
my fear , talk to me , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , weg .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; Yes , my life changed .
&quot; Yes , changed me .
but there was a certain Yes , which changed my life to an un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly art . it started with a question of my youngest ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett , and Emer@@ son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for un@@ explained reasons all &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she would be a wa@@ iter from the south .
&quot; estimate , I need milk for my nav@@ el @-@ asse . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked them , if I could play with her when I was straight on the go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes , I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from there I swe@@ ars to play always with them , as soon as you go on , or wh@@ i@@ ther I go , I say always Yes -- each single time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family .
but it also has an amazing side effects : just before short , I actually did that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play back to play with my children my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a dream job .
I am author . I think of things , set up a life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create it TV . I create television .
I &apos;m making TV in large style .
in this TV @-@ season , I &apos;m responsible for this , 70 hours of program into the world .
four television programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
every shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV screen can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
one new episode every nine days of time four shows , including all nine days 20 million dollars , four TV programs , 70 hours of TV , three broad@@ casts simultaneously , 15 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series running on Thursday night .
all over the world , my series will run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I myself have created , and not only produced , so even ob@@ serving . I must find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires to burn around the world .
do you know who still makes it ?
nobody , that is why I am a titanium .
dream job .
I would not like to im@@ press it .
I say it , because I know what you think if the word &quot; author . &quot;
I tell you that all of you who work so hard if you say a company , a country or a class@@ room , let me know if I say good@@ bye to work , and it &apos;s true if I say : I understand that there is no dream job during a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all swe@@ at -- no tears .
I have been working much , hard and I love it .
if I have been deep@@ ened into work , there is no other feeling .
my work creates a country out of nothing .
it is when I set up troops , I painted on one screen .
so as they dre@@ amed a high tone , lie@@ ve a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work it .
she is creative , mechanically , demanding and l@@ ump , clin@@ ically and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and fri@@ gh@@ ty , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing it is the sum@@ s .
there is such a change in me when working well .
a sum@@ s starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s sounds like a busy street , I could always go for you .
many people take on if I send them the sum@@ s that I persu@@ ade my writing to help you .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it .
but the sum@@ s -- when I started working with television production began to work and work to work and work together , I discovered this thing that sum@@ s to create this energy . the sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s is more than the writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s of God is his voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , you can &apos;t go differently than to size .
the feeling , not unlike any size , no matter , no matter what price is .
that is called the sum@@ s .
or maybe it means to be a work@@ piece .
maybe it is gen@@ ius .
maybe it means E@@ go .
maybe it is the fear of the failure .
I don &apos;t know it .
I know only that I am not made for failure , and I know only that I love the sum@@ s .
I will only say you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it into question .
to make a clear : the more successful I will , more episodes , the more superior borders , the more work there &apos;s more , the more things I write , more about I write history , so more expectations are available .
the more I work to be successful , the more must work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country , which I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I am the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , ex@@ ag@@ ated .
the sum@@ s stop .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth , that her m@@ um is a single employee .
Har@@ per tells us people : &quot; my m@@ om will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ ald says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to go to Sh@@ onda @-@ country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the children of a titanium .
they are Baby @-@ titanium .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s ceased .
the sum@@ s of the engine is silent .
I loved my work anymore . the engine was out of .
the sum@@ s came not back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Titan@@ conditioning work , 15 hours @-@ day , ended weekends , no Reu@@ e , nothing deleg@@ ating , a titanium sleeps , is not available , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a preview Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun more .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
so , if you do , what you do , do the work that you love , suddenly f@@ ails ?
I know , some may think : &quot; h@@ ay you out , bl@@ asting the author of titanium . &quot;
but you know , you do , one works , one loves to be a teacher , a painter , who knows how to know the sum@@ s when you knew the sum@@ s when you stop the sum@@ s , who is it then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a titanium ?
when the song of my heart does , I can survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m looking forward to outside , late and she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ om , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say , when two things are aware of :
first , I must say Yes to say and second , she called me not &quot; prize . &quot;
she calls no more &quot; prize . &quot;
when did that happen ?
I miss it when I am Titan and my sum@@ s , and here will change everything before my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and thus she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ om , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
it is nothing special .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and their sisters , we laugh too much and I was dramatic from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my pan@@ ic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of the Sum@@ mary , I can do nothing but can beware .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land I create a weapon , the marathon , I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they do no longer exist .
everything that exists are st@@ icky fingers and hum@@ id k@@ isses , tender voices , wax pins and the song , in which it goes , or whatever the girl is going to release in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly bre@@ athe .
I can hardly believe that I at@@ me .
play the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a ment@@ ale door goes down and an energi@@ ub comes in .
and that is not immediately , but it happens to happen .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s comes slowly .
no full volume , hardly exists , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel when I know a magical mystery .
but let us remain in the case .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the work@@ men , the titanium dioxide which is only the replacement .
if I ask you who are you , if I tell you if I miss my brain by using broad@@ casts and TV hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot something that is true sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s is no strength and it is not working specific .
it is dependent on joy .
the genuine sum is dependent on love .
the sum@@ s is the river which comes from the way of life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ conscious and peace .
the real sum@@ s ign@@ ore the printing of history , which can be used to accompl@@ ish the expect@@ ation and pressure .
the genuine sum is simple and original .
the true sum@@ s is the voice of God in my ear , but perhaps I whis@@ per@@ ed to God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a titanium ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I am doing this to the firm , so that I can free myself as work@@ ah@@ olic of any gu@@ ilt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be as easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
play me not a little bit as working as working .
the truth does hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play .
I always work , because I love it .
I rather am at the workplace than at home .
this conf@@ ession is pain@@ ful , for what a man works rather than to be home ?
well yes , I .
I hon@@ est , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed , is none of them .
we stopped in the garden , before and back , go back and forth .
we do little dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we grin@@ d soap bub@@ bles .
so I feel predominantly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and conf@@ used .
I always go to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe met me .
I play and play , until I ask myself : why did we ever hear with the games ?
you can also say it ! Yes , if your child want to play with you .
perhaps you keep myself for n@@ ai@@ v , for a day dre@@ aming .
you probably have right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you also know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes with me until they have something else to do something else . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes you will replace a Marien@@ cheese or bis@@ cuit .
and speaks my teen@@ ie @-@ daughter all 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more needs not need .
everyone can carry 15 minutes a piece , even on a bad @-@ mood !
15 minutes at a time !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no off@@ ence .
the day is short : dinner , ready for children .
but 15 minutes are dr@@ ine !
my children are my welfare lo@@ ase , my world . it must not be the children . it is true to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for his soul fri@@ ght .
it &apos;s not going to play with your own children . it &apos;s about Joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Games &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
enjoy the 15 minutes !
find out what you do good .
find out and store it .
I am not perfect in it . I don &apos;t fail and I will meet friends , enjoy books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself anymore and more .
15 minutes on a piece , why not yet full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my free time . the sum@@ s seems to return to return when I do not work .
work doesn &apos;t work without playing .
it needs time , but after a few months opens up a door that flow@@ ed off and I find me into my office . I hear a unknown mel@@ ody , she met me and my soul . they lead me to new ideas . I use it in full gro@@ wers and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I love it not .
I do not need it .
I am not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s isn &apos;t I ... no more .
soap bub@@ bles and st@@ icky fingers , dinner with friends .
now that is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just one part . and I am so than@@ k@@ ful .
it is me to think that I am a Titan . I have never seen a titanium , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything in my handle . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the lucky I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel like good mother .
the more I play , the more clear is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . I shoot the marathon , I run , the troops , the fla@@ x , the sum@@ s that sum@@ s , the other , the right sum@@ s : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more makes this unusual , remaining , naked and new feeling of life in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am an author . I think about things I got up to life .
it belongs to the job , which means to live its dream .
that is the dream of this jobs ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ aming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ sur@@ gin .
as most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies each day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a severe stroke , or after a car accident .
for us Neuro@@ sur@@ geon , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , in contrast to other body organs , a very small skill .
after a severe violation of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
that is probably the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ sur@@ gin .
what is a functional Neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a physician , trying to improve the ner@@ ve functions through various surgical measures .
surely they have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; Tie@@ fen@@ hir@@ n@@ stimulation &quot; . in doing so , we im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson , which suffered severe trembling and heavy pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon is the restoration of brain .
in my opinion we are approaching us this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was Senior Physi@@ cian and worked for day and night in the emergency review .
I often supply patients with skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma .
you need to imagine that at skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a takes a brain and the cran@@ ial he@@ d@@ pressure is til@@ ted .
to save the life , one must decrease the cran@@ ial pressure pressure .
you sometimes need to remove a piece of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analy@@ ze us with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass .
what will I do with this ?
we wanted cells to grow from this tissue .
this is not easy task .
cells of a tissue content grow , comparable with all small children who are taken out of your families .
you must find the right diet , temperature , moisture and environments to flour@@ ish .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , it was Jean @-@ François .
this he looked under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
perhaps you know of the bi@@ ologic lessons that stem cells are un@@ mature cells that can trans@@ form themselves into any cell type of organis@@ m .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to receive this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OR .
we made a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they divided slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like tri@@ bal cells , but was different .
we needed long to understand whence they came .
they are from these cells .
this blue and red cells are called Dou@@ b@@ lec@@ tic in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cer@@ eb@@ radi@@ al cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in stage of the F@@ öt@@ us , they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay for us ?
we don &apos;t know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , since we find them in higher concentrations at brain injuries .
but this is not so sure .
one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that allows the brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop a experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of bra@@ ins from the non @-@ language area and then cultiv@@ ate the cells exactly as soon as Jean @-@ François did
and then mark colour mark to track them in the brain .
in the last step we im@@ planted them at the discovery of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous tran@@ splantation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ tran@@ splantation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we im@@ planted these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ planted the same cells into the brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that she had been taken back after some weeks , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they &apos;re not needed there , so they disappear there .
in the second scenario , we had a violation of and im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now remained the cells -- it grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could see under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells , which were im@@ planted .
the proof that they show , are these small points . these are the cells that we set in vitro , in the culture .
we could not stop there .
do these cells also help to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill task .
they had to take food pellets from a tray .
they made it very well .
when it had achieved a stable dex@@ ter@@ ti@@ bility level , we had the motor @-@ motor@@ ic Cor@@ tex motor range .
then the monkeys were par@@ aly@@ zed , they could not move their hand anymore .
exactly how it would happen to people , they wonder@@ ed spont@@ ane@@ ously up to a certain degree , just like a stroke .
the patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover plastic brain mechanisms . get up to a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached the spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left hand they see the monkeys , which was spontaneous .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now , when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the maturity .
I can say you , that were very exciting results too .
since that time we have found much more about these cells .
we can fre@@ eze it and then use it later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models for example under Park@@ inson .
but our dream is still alive to im@@ pl@@ unge them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need it . &quot;
I definitely fall .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human subjects .
Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the largest obstacles are the authorities . starting from this great results you have to fill about two kilograms of Pap@@ iere and For@@ ms to run this kind of studies .
BG : under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : Yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and a very professional team .
BG : take a look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried permission to start clinical trials . if you go further into the future , how many years it takes it until someone can come into hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of clinical trial .
will it allow us to start the authority soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it already needs a long time to choose the treatment and evaluate the treatments and evaluate , whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
then you need to apply this to a multi@@ center study .
you must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and tells us that you have told us .
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
we will make a big mistake in the West as of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see Democracy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the frag@@ ile plant which is in reality , but as the inventory of our society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to consider them as a un@@ changeable ear .
we believe that capitalism conduc@@ ts capitalism to democracy .
that is not right .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have proven doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while the policy remains un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy is approaching us in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I re@@ presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was in@@ comprehen@@ si@@ fied that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- do not affect the au@@ ster@@ ing programs that were implemented in Greece .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this moment , I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , or the Communist Party of China , or some of my superior friends who would have been abolished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this point I would like to imagine an economic model for a real democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I please , together with me , believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group in an error , we could save the democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ ensive democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because without democracy , our societies are m@@ apped , our future dark and our great , new technologies .
to the topic of waste , I would like to pay attention to an interesting contra@@ diction that currently our host are threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tw@@ ins @-@ par@@ ad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt crisis , who raises its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all recognize the debt crisis ,
but only a few recognize its Di@@ dy@@ mus .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the se@@ ag@@ ility of savings and corpor@@ ations , however , could be present there , where it could be productive and income could produce , even all things could produce humanity , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the US , in England and the Eurozone , 3.4 trillion US dollars were invested in all the pro@@ sper@@ ity producers , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , equipment and so on .
a total of 3.4 trillion US dollar sounds much money , until one compar@@ es it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars , which is equivalent to the same period in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock markets and gr@@ ate the real estate prices .
so , debts and un@@ productive capital , the twin summit , which are not identical with common market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the United States , Japan and Europe are unemployed , which could not invest in a low demand , which could not invest in which they could not invest . exactly as Ö@@ di@@ pus father , who could not kill him that his son would kill him if he grow up ,
un@@ wanted the circumstances that leads to lead that o@@ di@@ pus k@@ ills him .
that is my shar@@ ks with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his very successful art &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All the un@@ productive capital should be used to develop our lives to develop human talents and particularly all the technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , which are decisive for the rescue of Earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so democracy is the solution ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; but before we continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but before we continue , what do we understand ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of social form , in which the free and the poor as a majority of the government control .
the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was of course too many - --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be an error , the job value of the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy due to these connections .
the decisive point of the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was , and that she was involved in the working arms , but not only the right to free expression of expression , but more important and crucial to them to maintain their right @-@ determination with same voting rights in question of state aid .
the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy is not kept long --
like a candle that sh@@ ines very bright , it is too fast .
however , our present demo@@ cra@@ cies have not their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the processing poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a statute for controlling .
because the liberal democracy was set up until now , when a complete separation of politics and economy was bor@@ dered by the democratic process , while the economy -- so the world of the Group -- a democracy @-@ free zone was made .
in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the date , in which the separation of politics and economy began , an in@@ inher@@ ited fight between the two , and the economy gradually mig@@ rated to politics and sei@@ ze them .
do you wonder why the politicians are not so far ?
it does not exist at a de@@ generation of its DNA .
it is about that one can be in the government today , and still not in power because the power of politics into the economy is split and the areas separated .
I mentioned my shar@@ ks with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of prey , which is so sustain@@ ably the animals , from which they nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated that she was hungry at the end .
similarly , it is similar to the economy that is so far @-@ ni@@ b@@ alized that it grows through the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of the corpor@@ ations grows , the in@@ equality is attributable to overall economic demand and the general manager of the corpor@@ ations are changing to invest in the cash of their enterprise .
depending on the successful capitalism , the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher will become the tw@@ ins , and so bigger the waste of human being and the pro@@ sper@@ ity of humanity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we must return the policy and economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control keeps the control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is no new idea .
the mar@@ x@@ ist Lin@@ ke had this idea ago 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t very good .
the doctrine from the debut of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms should only recover a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new species of breeding and waste .
but there is a solution : working the working arms !
capitalism does it , being re@@ paying low @-@ wages by automation and robots .
the problem is to be so long economy and policy separate areas , automation makes the twin apples to be higher , the waste of waste , and the social conflicts lower , as it was -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries such as China will come .
so we must implement the economy and restore the areas of economy and politics again , so that we should democr@@ ats the re@@ unified area of democr@@ ats , otherwise we will show the film &quot; Matrix &quot; like a documentation .
so , the question is not , whether capitalism has produced the technical achievements , which he has caused , can survive --
the more interesting question is to be replaced by a d@@ yst@@ ia , similar to &quot; Matrix &quot; in which the company will serve people and hide their energy into the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long convers@@ ations to the sense of life .
I believe we must be optim@@ istic .
so what does it mean , how could it look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; @-@ like utop@@ ia instead of &quot; matrix &quot; similar di@@ yst@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in brief , some examples .
in the area of companies : please ask a capital market , in which one works money , while one works and in which your capital will work from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter what you just works -- is the property of those who currently work in the company .
then all income from capital and revenues and the concept of wage work is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between them which belong to the company , but they are not working there , but the company does not hear there . no di@@ ver between capital and work , no major g@@ aps between investment and spe@@ ars , and finally did not reach twin tw@@ ins .
in the field of global political economy : please make sure that our national currencies would have a free s@@ lim@@ ming exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of whole mankind .
imagine that the entire world trade will be tra@@ ded in this currency , we call them &quot; The cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; &apos; -- and any government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country in a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; Green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment funds are ra@@ r .
this is no new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 had proposed .
the problem was that you did not implement the technical resources at that time .
today we have , in particular , in particular before the back@@ drop of a unified policy and economy .
the world , which I call you , is simultaneously liber@@ ated , in which it was privileg@@ ed persons , and Marx@@ ist , because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the Mül@@ lers of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ ast@@ ian , global key@@ bo@@ ar@@ ian .
but above all others , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
are we awak@@ ening in such a world
or are we going to drop in a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar di@@ yst@@ ia ?
the answer is based on how we decide jointly polit@@ ically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better .
thank you for .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ an@@ is ...
you bring yourself in your biography itself as a liberal Marx@@ ist Marx@@ ist .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said , Marx is relevant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we not do this , the technological development will produce a massive decline in overall economic demand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Larry sum@@ mers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long term stag@@ nation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis of a part of the earth on the next , as we see it currently , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ize our democracy , but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ ally democracy is small .
if this analysis is applicable , Marx is absolutely relevant ,
similarly , Hay@@ ek , that is why I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and how Key@@ nes , and why am I also perfect .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if one isn &apos;t wir@@ less , don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said . BG : in your talk , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the Red@@ ner you have very clearly said that you keep from the view of the West to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a big measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the Ticket of a democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited the democracy on policy , during the area where the field has occurred , -- the area of economy -- a fully democratic @-@ free zone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in some ways , if I may say the so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for -- Do you remember to connect liber@@ alism to democracy -- that is an error , histor@@ ically considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly sk@@ ep@@ tical , which affects the democratic development .
what you can see now in China , very similar development which we had in England during the industrial revolution , particularly the transition from the first to the second .
China now to propose that what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells amazing to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ eners were curious about your experiences as a finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I ins@@ ult that it comes .
BG : Yes ...
how do you look back six months after the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view@@ point , and very dis@@ appointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely , to adopt us from the self @-@ contrac@@ eption , and the den@@ ying that a solid branch line through the euro@@ zone ran , and continues to increase the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek slaughter -- the way , who was the first proposal to den@@ oun@@ ce this den@@ ial -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
unfortunately , the powers inside the Eurozone , within the European group , continues to den@@ ying the den@@ ial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if one tries to get an economic system that is not li@@ vi@@ able , by political will and authorities , it may perhaps be able to go beyond any time , but if the change occurs , he ab@@ rupt@@ ly ab@@ rupt@@ ly and destroyed .
BG : which change can you advance ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro zone has no future when we do not change its structure .
BG : have you made any mistake in your time as finance ministers ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back - seri@@ ally ...
if there is a minister of finance , or any minister , who claimed after 6 months in office , especially in a so @-@ called situation , he asser@@ ted that he did not have an error , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mist@@ akes .
the largest error was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an hon@@ est interest on the pages of the money , a common solution .
but this was not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wanted to bring only our government to fall , only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the ab@@ brevi@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to see that she had been a cat@@ ast@@ roph@@ ic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none from the Tro@@ ika of the Money , who has imposed this policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a kol@@ os@@ ano@@ int mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all , and despite the aggressive form of convers@@ ations , you seem to be quite a @-@ European despite all of the aggressive form of convers@@ ations .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro zone opposite to someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the euro zone does not survive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they do not survive , the transgres@@ sors will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not have disast@@ rous consequences for Europe , but for the entire world economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the most powerful economy in the world .
if we reach ourselves the way of a post modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will also be also able to be the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you hope you will be wrong in this point .
Y@@ an@@ is , thank you very much that you were with T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
Roy Price has never heard the most , although it is probably responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably for 22 very entert@@ aining minutes , but not for many of you .
that goes back to the decision , the Roy arrived three years ago .
Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ r@@ is@@ ure and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because it is responsible for the shows and content that will produce the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fighting industry .
there are so many TV @-@ series so that Roy cannot select anything .
he must have shows , which are very good , very good .
in other words , he must shows shows that are located on the right side of this turn .
this curve is the evaluation division of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this evaluation .
will be your show with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then one has a successful show .
these are shows how &quot; Break@@ ing Bath , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that ad@@ dic@@ ted where you have seen a season , your brain asks : &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should be enough to tell you what is left at that end of the curve .
Roy Price does not think on the left side of the turn , because I don &apos;t need special intelligence to accommodate &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he makes more thoughts about the mean har@@ dening , the average television -- the shows that neither good nor bad they are thr@@ ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so he must ensure that he really is on the right hand .
the pressure is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon has something like this , so I want to risk Roy Price .
he wants to create successes .
it is guaranteed for a guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition .
he particip@@ ates many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses eight candidates for TV Shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online where they can take it for free .
and if Amazon gives out free things , you don &apos;t feel right , right ?
millions of viewers have seen this episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know that they are observed during the watch of this shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team that take all of them .
you capture when you start the show when you &apos;re p@@ aus@@ ed , which parts you re@@ j@@ ure or look again .
they collect millions of data to decide on these data they should produce them .
in fact , they collect the data , processing these and this will be the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four republi@@ can U.S. trans@@ ators . &quot;
they did this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
Yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that many of them cannot remember this show because it was not so good .
it &apos;s only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve 7.4 is and Alpha House arrives at 7.5 -- so much on average , but not just what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time at another company has a top @-@ show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking for the search to find this a super show and it uses data for it , but it does something different .
instead of a competition , he and his team have viewed the existing data on Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews , which they give the shows , which shows that shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find this small details about the viewer : which shows them , which producers , which actor .
when they had together all the parts , they went a car , and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four transmitters , but a drama series of sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
Yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has hit a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; House of Cards &quot; gets a 9.1 rating on this turn . so it &apos;s exactly where they wanted .
of course , the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competent , data reversible companies .
they combine these many data , and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because logic has som@@ eh@@ ow that all should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision that you meet , then you should meet a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it optimi@@ zes it through very powerful computers .
the minimum , what you can expect , is good television , or ?
if data analysis is not working , this is a little effort because we live in one time we read more and more to statistics , in order to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody can ever get in contact with this software , so you &apos;re in contact with this software .
if someone is in prison here in the USA and ask for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is made or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but rather than decide whether a show is good or bad will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
central television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there are evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results . this is not that a company like Multi @-@ Health system does not know how to use data .
the data reversible companies are even wrong .
Yes , even Google does sometimes make mist@@ akes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it is likely to say by data analysis of flu , the worst way , predic@@ table -- by data analysis of Google research .
it function@@ ed wonderful and was a great news station . the success gi@@ p@@ fel@@ te in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature &quot; .
it worked just off , year around year until it didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and nobody could say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sens@@ ation , including the release of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature &quot; .
even the data reversible companies such as Amazon and Google are sometimes mis@@ understood .
despite all these errors , data in the decisions of the life is an -- at the workplace , in the legal framework , in medicine .
so we should rather ensure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted genet@@ ics -- an area where some very wise men use un@@ imag@@ in@@ able people to make serious decisions , as the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognized some samples on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be distributed .
if you need to solve a complex problem , do mainly do two things :
as a result , this problem is in his individual parts so that you can analy@@ ze the individual parts ; as well , the individual parts put together in order to set a decision .
sometimes you must do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and turn it again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how ma@@ cht@@ ful , can help make a problem to dis@@ assem@@ ble and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to merge the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we have all : our brain .
if there is something that the brain is good , it is parts and songs together , even if the information is un@@ complete , in order to hold a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have data and understanding , where they are also in process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they use the data to understand their audience , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the decision how to make all these pieces , and make it up a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was not in the data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , what meant that they went to a large personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on other hand did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first than they chose TV ideas , then called &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they always could say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions but I believe that things are wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how ma@@ cht@@ ful they are , data are just one tool , and in order to be forgotten , this instrument is quite useful .
thanks to you ...
before it was data , this was the device for decisions .
many people know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for cho@@ ices via a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- exactly here in this moment .
I will later interpre@@ t it with a technique demo .
so far I met some cho@@ ices in my life , where I would have list@@ ened to the ball in the night .
but , as you know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace this by something much compensation , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic setup .
the ball , perhaps the ball , and kl@@ ets and cl@@ assy . finally , it &apos;s possible to meet decisions , if we want to reach something unusual at the end of the right turn .
and I felt this as a very encour@@ aging message that despite the great amount of data , it is still paying off to make decisions , an expert on what you do , and risks .
because at the end , there is not the data , but the risks involved with which you have at the right end of the curve .
thank you beautiful .
