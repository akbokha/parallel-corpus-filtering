<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him maybe because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times in New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before somebody had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen, wrote a book in which he is spectacular that the NSA have illegally heard of the Americans of the Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But there is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a disastrous US intelligence operation, in which the CIA was literally over for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know what the chapter doesn't like at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years the government filed under Risen and asked him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became the symbol for the design of the government, Whistlebars to condemn and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to use this right, if media do not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave, they will be priced.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government dispatched with Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters had already done before him: he refused, and said that he would rather go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen was so with the risk to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the process, there happened something unusual.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, though they were important for years, it were essential for their case, the government demands were dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can always hide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing and raisans, they could carry out his digital footsteps for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigator have, without his understanding, to be concerned his telephone approach to his phone,</seg>
<seg id="21">Equally as its e-mail data, financial and banking information, his lending information, and even travel information with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">Among those information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, the CIA-Whistleblower and risens.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower at his presence, but the justice voted more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how to be a problem, especially because the government wants to take much of their work as a home.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of which a Whistlebars went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we have to set the press work to the game that is to be protected by the first constitutional complaint, because the government has more possibilities to make any more.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of repeats, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can take advantage of the moment in which they contact, rather than in the night, in the witness level.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software that has not been written, as Risen his book, and it is much more secure than ordinary E-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is a SecureDrop, an open source open system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet's most famous, which was developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, please go to a news website, such as the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send documents, as with any special contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the relevant news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot order any more information, and many of the information that would like it would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole that protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments in all over the world are always new spying technologies, who are all dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is necessary to ensure that not only technology services such as Edward Snowden have a possibility to give abuse of abuse. it's just important that we protect the next Whistlebars,</seg>
<seg id="39">The more abused abnormalities in the supply of soldiers who wants to report about survived hospitals. or to the next environmental workers, the alarm to negotiate water of Flint. or a pilgrim-Insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "after all, these technologies have not only been taken for those who want to uncover crimes but to protect our constitutional rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you for.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the largest data leck of the story was published.] [What does this mean, reveal that the rich and Mighty] have been hiding [enormous money sums in tax havases.] [What does this mean?] [What does this mean?] this week we were signed by messages about a rectangle of 11 million documents of the Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of this documents have a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We will get an impression how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mossack Fonseca go and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you setup this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also there are reports that a ban of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad boxy companies in tax havens has.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars on Russia's President Vladimir Putin will lead over a close friend from children's days, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others, who are nervous to the next release, and to the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now sounds like the plot of an agencies or a John-Grisham-ROM.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems that cries away from you, me, ordinary men.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should us do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and mighty are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not all of their taxes, then this means fewer funds for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havases are used by a few few, to hide their wealth and to make sure what we have been discussing for ten years and unveil.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think, many people will be very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how this tax havases work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a Matrjoschkapu.</seg>
<seg id="60">So, one company has a firm in another company, in a further company which makes it nearly impossible to understand, who's behind this prayer.</seg>
<seg id="61">It may be very difficult for prosecutions and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what thing is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there have been no prominent Americans that previously appeared in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there is no rich Americans that you hide their wealth in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle, after which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">We would have a data leck of the Cayman Islands, or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some U.S. States less information needs to specify less information to set a company than to make a librarian identification.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of transparency in the USA allowed it to cut school children, school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is allowed to zoom particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior which concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered investigator in the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as a african minister, who wanted to bring money into the US to buy a yacht to buy a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked it, that all up to a lawyer made our investigator's proposals, how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all preprepretions. none of these lawyers received us as a client, and of course there was no man committed to that money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider that not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not going to have a single advocate, who has exposed to our discovered investigations.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single leader, wrapped in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It's how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we must change the rules to make this type of behavior." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This is very well-known, as if we could do anything, as if nothing could have changed; as if there is always the rich and mighty.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as borrowed optimist, I really see that a lot has started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the past few years we have seen pre-breaches to more transparency, which concerns the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has been recorded in central registers at national level, who is really behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US has left off.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have contributed a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this makes no progress that we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "" "" "we would really like to see how this Panama's revelations" "", "this huge insight into the world of tax havens, as a means used to ensure greater transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">"" "" "" "we need ordinary people who are mad when they see how other people can hide their real identity behind headlights." ""</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy that rise up and say," "" "Intransparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need the leading politicians that recognize the problem and deploying themselves through laws this type of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally quit the intransparent, which allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering, finally finished.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I had almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazdas would be.</seg>
<seg id="97">A day after I completed my design studies, I made a backyard.</seg>
<seg id="98">One type in the red Mazda remained and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip through the whole country. after that he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the invoice, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where are you going to pray today?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just didn't know him! he says he would go to peace corps, but I don't know if he really is planning. I don't have been kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">That's a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "Save how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">Night I was in bed, I got stuck to the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what was I blown up?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fright that I rose from the bed, on the tiff at the door, and my sleep door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he bought from me today is now on his classroom. he is teacher now.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my viewing angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold in childhood as stranger, actually friends who were waiting for waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">We make a short jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost plea, my roommate attracts and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe, creativity can make it possible to transform it in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new co-inhabitant Brian Chesky: "Brian, I've found something to earn something. our apartment is equipped with a designer bed-and-Breakfast. young designer can lodge with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "we created a website and so" "" "air mattress and breakfast" "" "[AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb]." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we also.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure that we tasted our cheese-ham-Omelamine completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured them through the whole city. when we had ended our last guest leaving the door into the castle, Brian and I joined us.</seg>
<seg id="134">We just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and we've been able to pay our rental?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to the roll.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented ourselves to the investors: "we want to create a site in public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms, their doors one closes when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite all alien people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would have been kindled.</seg>
<seg id="142">But did not do it.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still at consolation would invest in a business that allows a foreigner to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all have learned children, strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you have to know about things that you can do well. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the whole experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned objects, how to design objects, but now we wanted to create confidence, between humans who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be so anything?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with Design Trust?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample sample, which degree confidence we ascended.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will enforce you out of your comfort one.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlock mobile on your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent flight of panic, which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So do most guests feel when they are somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only from this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only so, who now has Al Gores mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you declare to Twitter that he was president for the President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I want to tell you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a small detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor could only be presented with his name; if he tells how he comes, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, you have 150 Beaches that all say: "he can really hold a very well-locked cell phone!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when using your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">"" "" "" "for a well-called feedback system strengthens confidence." ""</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for the people, negative faces.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest published their convictions, before we set them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined, as probably it is that people trust each other, depending on how they are in terms of age and housing.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust the people most, which are most similar.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less trust we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social Voreengineers.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by Beurity.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three issues, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">However, one has more than ten, changing everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good call of similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we discovered that confidence is dependent on how much one is in the price.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If one tells little, like "Hi!," you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">Tells you much as for example: "I have problems with my mother's -- -- the request is also not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there's an optimal level of openness, for example "Great art works in your apartment! I'm doing with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create it with design, to produce this degree of Openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics should be something to write.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices from a strange woman.</seg>
<seg id="194">With which we did not reckoned, the great amount of people who were more than ready to lay these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people are entitled to take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Secondly: the untireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a demand that was not covered beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="200">The shop is running very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times, if not everything is smooth.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests that allow unlawful partys celebrated or dwellings devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly on my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood in front of the front when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than this calls. it's already hurt if I only think.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the bond, and will always be our biggest motivation to improve our further motivation.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of 123 million had only a fraction of the nights.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people confided to right to right.</seg>
<seg id="210">When confidence works, it is possible to emerge.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests enjoyed vacation in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts drove him into the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even spends blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is its assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers that tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra is genuine protected gel that save a life even though they don't know it properly.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want it to be solitary, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, of course not every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure cash transaction are exactly what you want to reach with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled on this concept for the first time, I asked:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of the partial with monetary transactions combined?</seg>
<seg id="226">It comes to a economic market.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but just" "" "but it is just" "" "rental industry" "" "to call it just." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade and human relationships promises.</seg>
<seg id="229">People create a part of itself, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If one travels nowadays, it is efficient with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what would be if travelling a rich buffet from local single press?</seg>
<seg id="232">What would be, if in each place you visited, a group there would wait there, a group there would be a thoroughly complete and one at a circumcise area of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you want to learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to make apartments of reason to participate?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would be if cities would assume the common part of the common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I set up cities which allow us society and relations, instead of solitude and disclosure.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. lots of parking places, which belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered to residents. students who were looking for a stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were mediated to people whose children were gone out. the incubation period were launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even hosting.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be so crazy, as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality also gave it before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just done our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing we knew that one can find the right design with the existing trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deepening advantages.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think that is amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Ideal for overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it if a red Mazda goes on me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We of course, that design can not solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for design shortly.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you for.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a brain underwear, a terror crist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay in the airport of safety at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the debt for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent the media, so look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean, most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably the people don't speak with their uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never learned a Muslim: it's great, you know.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- two espresso, with whipped cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am married,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchteous-Fitness fanatian,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to decide.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outen me.</seg>

<seg id="280">I have delays with the Quran.</seg>

<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock walked quickly in emptance.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do anything?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched to the television channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists"..., "... in the name of Islam..."... "Jihadist..."... "Kjihad..."... "sticky Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">O my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country attacked, but in the Nu related to me the works of others from a civil war into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to go through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new town and begin with the postgraduate course.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember, as I was silent -- when we were silent -- then deep things went into my seat, and I feared the first time to be recognized as the Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then I heard, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said:" "" "be careful," "" "ye be careful," "" "lead in well lit up" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage of coverage.</seg>

<seg id="311">There were really brandances to mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt really wrong.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who had attacked this land had attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I won the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the apologies that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today, we can actually hear people: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When are we going on? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to compare Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as a tumor in the body of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or good?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and malignant tumor just under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are like all the other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventor and teachers, Ersthelfer and Olympias.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will there be safe deposit of mosques in America?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visiting of a mosque leads to people other faith tolerant, and greater participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a director of the police in Washington, DC recently told: people actually won't be radical in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radiated in their cellar or in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">At the Radical process you've found that it starts out of their congregation, even by their family, so that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behavior and their ideology, is a traitor or belief.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still assert that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS formulated its breeding with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As the Muslim, as a mother, as a man, I think that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would then add to their preference, if one recognize them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups announce their ideology, on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when you cast a look at her, she does not drives what they are in" "" "Holy Scripture" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they can read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me a amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because they pre-use to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radial religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said, the problem was exactly the opposite. every ghost, with whom she spoke, brought her to silence, and said, her wrath, their sense for injustice in the world, to bring it into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing, and something that had given birth to their rage, she was a main goal for the instrumentization by extremists who promised to have a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">"" "" "" "this Imam introduced the connection to God and their church." ""</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead, instead of accused her rage, he showed their constructive paths for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learnt at the mosque, kept them to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was a insight, as the Islamophobia and my family affects.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it work on normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it work on any other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How is the 24-hour consumption of fear every day to our democracy on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually, several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear us, there will happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authorized government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if you consider test persons messages which were reported negative on Muslims, they voted more military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">When you look, when the mood against Muslims moved up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terror attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the apron of Iraq and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So, Islamophobia is not just the natural reaction to the Muslim terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to pay the foundation of a free society, the sensible and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">To deal with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear of us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective education, it is not only thing to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both of them went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the most sweet man, that she knew her.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there, and he showed her curriculum. she was blossom and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is such an experienced young man?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne, her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her in the afternoon like the sister of Yusor, Razan who was born in the afternoon. he did it in her home, as opposed to Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times at Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism cannot be morally morally, but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we passed to the mosque, or stayed safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not a slight decision because it went to America to let us do our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in whom we can freely practise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to join the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we drove silent, with high-pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, my shoes went out, went into the building hall, and what I saw that he left me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless full.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made a announcement, because the half of the meetings were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but in order to attack us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In that moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there, because they had courage and compassion on panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from fear and fanaticism at the moment?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to go safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or are you to connect my: we are better than those.</seg>

<seg id="409">Before the air package in our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircrafts used in Frac Centre in France has built a six-metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting you can reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-loaded structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They learned to carry loads to deal with turbulences and are generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">"" "" "" "our goal is to exceed the boundaries of the possible flight." ""</seg>
<seg id="415">So a system autonomous work, it needs to know collective shaving, where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">At our lab at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localising technology of Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, calculations on board which should do the machine.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available on the highest image. for example," "" "start" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device that tries to beat two flying with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starring, it is efficient, much more efficient as helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most powerful men, it can be float, and thus has great advantages with start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a sweeping page.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear devices is that they react sensitive to turbulences such as wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it, it doesn't matter what position is able to reattain the optimal position and improves performance through practice.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often provide basic abstract Questions that are led to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question might be, for example: what is the small number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are about as machines, known as machines with a thousand movable parts that are to violate you to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, educated pilots could fly remote-controlled flight devices, which only had two movable parts: one propeller and a stern thruster.</seg>
<seg id="435">By far, we discovered that flies can work with just one.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monbuinner, the mechanically simplest flight device. it was invented in a short time.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No sorts, hinge and transverse lines, no further positions or controllers, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it's mechanically simple, it happens very much to fly in the interior, so that it can move stable in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to bring it to flying, I must throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability, to throw exactly correctly, if all see, is small, so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Monbuinner is an exercise in pleasure, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight propellers, an exercise in overflow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is an ambivalent in his orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thereby he receives the most commonly accepted capability,</seg>
<seg id="447">In the room to move all directions, no matter how he rotates, or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is shown in models, the rest is learns directly at the fly.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines will be part of our everyday use, it must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate twin-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When one builds them, they are like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, a bit wrong -- a engine or propeller is falling apart, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine even if limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this, making a half-airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic shafts.</seg>
<seg id="459">The great number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a pallet on aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took usual micro-quadcopter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and outfit them with localising technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to reflect new revolutionary ideas.</seg>

<seg id="470">This short moment is brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big knit.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy they were not in the form of light free --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into space-time gean even and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Arrange the events initially timed.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, a multi-star life was created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the Earth has brought quite a lot: corals, fish, plants, Saurier, people and -- God stand up at -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss was decided by the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- a huge laser detector that are searching for graviticating black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most people held it for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people knew it as mad genies, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After the decade development, design, conception and extremely hard work, they built the Detector LIGO: the Laser Interferometres of Graviation Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time, the precision of LIGO was significantly increased, which significantly improved the detection performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore we call him Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, LIGO started to clarify some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after commissioning of the detector, the gravitationwaves of the two collious black holes through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye to my death sick.</seg>
<seg id="491">It was basically the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, what I worked, is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at the MIT. he studied Gravitationwaves from black holes like LIGO measurable signals since 23 years. but what are Gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitation wave is a crusement of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its whole content will be stretched in one direction and stretched out into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">At the illustrative theory, lecturer in courses for the relativity is often a correct dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous, are ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On the 14th of September, for example, each of us stretched out the waves and stretched. stretching of an average human being was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1st of this way, the LIGO members is mad for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, and this is already absurd, the length would have to be measured at less than an thousandth of the radius of a nuclear core. that is neutral.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text on gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described by Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, hunting after the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties during the construction of such detectors are tremendous.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicist are finderive and with the support of the public will overcome all obstacles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">This was published in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claims, LIGO would be more an ear than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">That's quite practical. for so, you can justify a picture or a map of things by taking the of several points that you can perceive you.</seg>
<seg id="509">If it is different, it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Sounds tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore, it is very hard, actually impossible to produce a picture of things which are particularly much:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we wait for certain characteristics such as clay and level, rhythm and volume to close to the history behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice" speaks just Alice. "</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob she breaks out."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitation waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can do with them no easy pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But having regard to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least, the measured frequencies are at least for LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we can convert wave pattern in Shall, we can hear the universe.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation of gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes, where my colleague Scott has already busy very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, zircons simply: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two body very quickly, you hear the same pair of circlings with an additional tone change. this sounds like: Wu-proof-read-highlights!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a type of movement pattern, shaped in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that I never forget -- heard LIGO the following: [Surrendes Spush]) heard this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30 times of solar mass, which are about as fast as the staves of your shaker.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: we overlay ourselves short what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the dichest body in all, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns revolve per second, before they were collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these powers.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the remaining meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO is net a completely new way to exploring the universe, as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">In this way we can listen to the All and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in all, -- practically, or in principle --</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why masserole stars explode in supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned about all things.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes are done, but in the core, the behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon hidden.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see, because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Engraving waves of iron, as it would be transparent glass. the Urthora: I would like mad about the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see that the jungle is covered by his own neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="541">Thanks to gravitation waves, it should be possible to relocation up to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that we have never seen that all things we have never seen, which we have never seen, and of whom we're not able to discover that we can only discover that we listen.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO was right in the first attempt of things that we had not expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at the MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: ME: the kind of stars that watches the black holes, such as LIGO observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are soiling for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO enables us to make a completely different viewing angle to the events in all, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be so courageous as you can only be possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to create great Detectors, and the larvae of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatory -- a brand new generation of observatory on Earth and all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than the jungle himself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you for.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "one year long I would say to all" "" "Yes!" "" "I was afraid of whom I feared me." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter whether it got me nervous that brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced me "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Would I speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Wanted to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Would I start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly that to do, wovor I feared me, I think my anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, talk to me, my social fear -- Puff, weg.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"Yes, my life changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"Yes, changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes, which changed my life to an unexpectedly art. it started with a question of my youngest ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett, and Emerson." "" "Emerson, the youngest, calls for unexplained reasons all" ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she would be a waiter from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"estimate, I need milk for my navel-asse."</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she asked them, if I could play with her when I was straight on the go." "" "Yes, I said," "" "Yes." ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from there I swears to play always with them, as soon as you go on, or whither I go, I say always Yes -- each single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">"" "" "" "I am not perfect, but I'm very tired." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effects: just before short, I actually did that the "" "" Yes "" "" play back to play with my children my career. "" "</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think of things, set up a life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create it TV. I create television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm making TV in large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV-season, I'm responsible for this, 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV screen can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">One new episode every nine days of time four shows, including all nine days 20 million dollars, four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three broadcasts simultaneously, 15 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series running on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series will run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I myself have created, and not only produced, so even observing. I must find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires to burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still makes it?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, that is why I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it, because I know what you think if the word "author."</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard if you say a company, a country or a classroom, let me know if I say goodbye to work, and it's true if I say: I understand that there is no dream job during a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I have been working much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">If I have been deepened into work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is when I set up troops, I painted on one screen.</seg>
<seg id="608">So as they dreamed a high tone, lieve a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work it.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanically, demanding and lump, clinically and disturbing, clinically and frighty, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing it is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums sounds like a busy street, I could always go for you.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take on if I send them the sums that I persuade my writing to help you.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I started working with television production began to work and work to work and work together, I discovered this thing that sums to create this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than the writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums of God is his voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, you can't go differently than to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not unlike any size, no matter, no matter what price is.</seg>
<seg id="624">That is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it means to be a workpiece.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it means Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it is the fear of the failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know it.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I am not made for failure, and I know only that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I will only say you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to question it into question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear: the more successful I will, more episodes, the more superior borders, the more work there's more, the more things I write, more about I write history, so more expectations are available.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more must work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country, which I create, the marathon, I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I am the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exagated.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stop.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth, that her mum is a single employee.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells us people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerald says," "" "I would like to go to Shonda-country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-titanium.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine is silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work anymore. the engine was out of.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums came not back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titanconditioning work, 15 hours-day, ended weekends, no Reue, nothing delegating, a titanium sleeps, is not available, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a preview Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun more.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So, if you do, what you do, do the work that you love, suddenly fails?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know, some may think: "hay you out, blasting the author of titanium."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do, one works, one loves to be a teacher, a painter, who knows how to know the sums when you knew the sums when you stop the sums, who is it then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart does, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern states" "" "waitress" "" "is a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm looking forward to outside, late and she says:" "" "mom, do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say, when two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say Yes to say and second, she called me not "prize."</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no more "prize."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am Titan and my sums, and here will change everything before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and thus she says," "" "mom, do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and their sisters, we laugh too much and I was dramatic from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and in the absence of the Summary, I can do nothing but can beware.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I create a weapon, the marathon, I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they do no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, tender voices, wax pins and the song, in which it goes, or whatever the girl is going to release in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I atme.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mentale door goes down and an energiub comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not immediately, but it happens to happen.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums comes slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly exists, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel when I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us remain in the case.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the workmen, the titanium dioxide which is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who are you, if I tell you if I miss my brain by using broadcasts and TV hours and how working my brain is, then I forgot something that is true sums.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no strength and it is not working specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The genuine sum is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the river which comes from the way of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-conscious and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignore the printing of history, which can be used to accomplish the expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The genuine sum is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The true sums is the voice of God in my ear, but perhaps I whispered to God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I am doing this to the firm, so that I can free myself as workaholic of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be as easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Play me not a little bit as working as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I rather am at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This confession is painful, for what a man works rather than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">I honest, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed, is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We stopped in the garden, before and back, go back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We do little dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We grind soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">So I feel predominantly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always go to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe met me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask myself: why did we ever hear with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! Yes, if your child want to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you keep myself for naiv, for a day dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably have right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you also know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"" "" "" "my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes with me until they have something else to do something else." ""</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes you will replace a Mariencheese or biscuit.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speaks my teenie-daughter all 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more needs not need.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can carry 15 minutes a piece, even on a bad-mood!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes at a time!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no offence.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, ready for children.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are drine!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my welfare loase, my world. it must not be the children. it is true to feel the sums to have a place for his soul fright.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not going to play with your own children. it's about Joy,</seg>

<seg id="760">Enjoy the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do good.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I am not perfect in it. I don't fail and I will meet friends, enjoy books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training, when I wanted to surpass myself anymore and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on a piece, why not yet full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my free time. the sums seems to return to return when I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work doesn't work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It needs time, but after a few months opens up a door that flowed off and I find me into my office. I hear a unknown melody, she met me and my soul. they lead me to new ideas. I use it in full growers and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I love it not.</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sums, the sums isn't I... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">Now that is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of me, but just one part. and I am so thankful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is me to think that I am a Titan. I have never seen a titanium, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything in my handle. my brain is still working. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the lucky I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel like good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clear is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. I shoot the marathon, I run, the troops, the flax, the sums that sums, the other, the right sums: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more makes this unusual, remaining, naked and new feeling of life in me. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am an author. I think about things I got up to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">It belongs to the job, which means to live its dream.</seg>

<seg id="793">Titanen have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgin.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies each day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a severe stroke, or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us Neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, in contrast to other body organs, a very small skill.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe violation of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I was functional Neurosurgin.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A physician, trying to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Surely they have heard of one of the most well-known, the "Tiefenhirnstimulation". in doing so, we implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson, which suffered severe trembling and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we are approaching us this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">The brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was Senior Physician and worked for day and night in the emergency review.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supply patients with skull-Hirn-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You need to imagine that at skull-Hirn-traumata takes a brain and the cranial hedpressure is tilted.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save the life, one must decrease the cranial pressure pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">You sometimes need to remove a piece of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze us with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What will I do with this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted cells to grow from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Cells of a tissue content grow, comparable with all small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You must find the right diet, temperature, moisture and environments to flourish.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, it was Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he looked under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know of the biologic lessons that stem cells are unmature cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to receive this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OR.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They divided slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like tribal cells, but was different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand whence they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They are from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">This blue and red cells are called Doublectic in-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebradial cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In stage of the Fötus, they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay for us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, since we find them in higher concentrations at brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that allows the brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brains from the non-language area and then cultivate the cells exactly as soon as Jean-François did</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark colour mark to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we implanted them at the discovery of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotrantransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we implanted these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implanted the same cells into the brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that she had been taken back after some weeks, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they're not needed there, so they disappear there.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we had a violation of and implanted exactly the same cells and now remained the cells -- it grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could see under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells, which were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof that they show, are these small points. these are the cells that we set in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We could not stop there.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When it had achieved a stable dextertibility level, we had the motor-motoric Cortex motor range.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could not move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Exactly how it would happen to people, they wondered spontaneously up to a certain degree, just like a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover plastic brain mechanisms. get up to a certain degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached the spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left hand they see the monkeys, which was spontaneous.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now, when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the maturity.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can say you, that were very exciting results too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and then use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models for example under Parkinson.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still alive to implunge them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely fall.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human subjects.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the largest obstacles are the authorities. starting from this great results you have to fill about two kilograms of Papiere and Forms to run this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: Yes, but it needs a long time, a lot of patience and a very professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: take a look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried permission to start clinical trials. if you go further into the future, how many years it takes it until someone can come into hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to start the authority soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It already needs a long time to choose the treatment and evaluate the treatments and evaluate, whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you need to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and tells us that you have told us.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We will make a big mistake in the West as of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"" "" "" "we don't see Democracy" "" "as the fragile plant which is in reality, but as the inventory of our society." ""</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as a unchangeable ear.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism conducts capitalism to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not right.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big imitators in Beijing have proven doubt that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while the policy remains undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy is approaching us in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was incomprehensified that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- do not affect the austering programs that were implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">"" "" "" "in this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew, or the Communist Party of China, or some of my superior friends who would have been abolished." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to imagine an economic model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"" "" "" "I please, together with me, believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup in an error, we could save the democracy, but that we need a truthful and defensive democracy." ""</seg>
<seg id="913">Because without democracy, our societies are mapped, our future dark and our great, new technologies.</seg>
<seg id="914">To the topic of waste, I would like to pay attention to an interesting contradiction that currently our host are threatened.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twins-paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">"" "" "" "a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt crisis, who raises its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world." ""</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt crisis,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize its Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the seagility of savings and corporations, however, could be present there, where it could be productive and income could produce, even all things could produce humanity, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the US, in England and the Eurozone, 3.4 trillion US dollars were invested in all the prosperity producers, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, equipment and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">A total of 3.4 trillion US dollar sounds much money, until one compares it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which is equivalent to the same period in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock markets and grate the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">So, debts and unproductive capital, the twin summit, which are not identical with common market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the United States, Japan and Europe are unemployed, which could not invest in a low demand, which could not invest in which they could not invest. exactly as Ödipus father, who could not kill him that his son would kill him if he grow up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unwanted the circumstances that leads to lead that odipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my sharks with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"" "" "" "his very successful art" "" "All the unproductive capital should be used to develop our lives to develop human talents and particularly all the technologies," "" "green" "" "technologies, which are decisive for the rescue of Earth." ""</seg>
<seg id="928">So democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">"" "but before we continue," "" "but before we continue, what do we understand?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of social form, in which the free and the poor as a majority of the government control.</seg>
<seg id="931">The athenian democracy was of course too many - --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be an error, the job value of the athenic democracy due to these connections.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive point of the athenic democracy was, and that she was involved in the working arms, but not only the right to free expression of expression, but more important and crucial to them to maintain their right-determination with same voting rights in question of state aid.</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenian democracy is not kept long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines very bright, it is too fast.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present democracies have not their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the processing poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for controlling.</seg>
<seg id="940">Because the liberal democracy was set up until now, when a complete separation of politics and economy was bordered by the democratic process, while the economy -- so the world of the Group -- a democracy-free zone was made.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, since the date, in which the separation of politics and economy began, an ininherited fight between the two, and the economy gradually migrated to politics and seize them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are not so far?</seg>
<seg id="943">It does not exist at a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is about that one can be in the government today, and still not in power because the power of politics into the economy is split and the areas separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my sharks with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of prey, which is so sustainably the animals, from which they nourished, decimated that she was hungry at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similar to the economy that is so far-nibalized that it grows through the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations grows, the inequality is attributable to overall economic demand and the general manager of the corporations are changing to invest in the cash of their enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="948">Depending on the successful capitalism, the "demos" [the people] from democracy, the higher will become the twins, and so bigger the waste of human being and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">"" "if this is true, it is obvious that we must return the policy and economy again, and it would be better if the" "" "demos" "" "control keeps the control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners." ""</seg>
<seg id="950">This is no new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The marxist Linke had this idea ago 100 years ago and it wasn't very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine from the debut of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms should only recover a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new species of breeding and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: working the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it, being repaying low-wages by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is to be so long economy and policy separate areas, automation makes the twin apples to be higher, the waste of waste, and the social conflicts lower, as it was -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries such as China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we must implement the economy and restore the areas of economy and politics again, so that we should democrats the reunified area of democrats, otherwise we will show the film "Matrix" like a documentation.</seg>
<seg id="957">So, the question is not, whether capitalism has produced the technical achievements, which he has caused, can survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is to be replaced by a dystia, similar to "Matrix" in which the company will serve people and hide their energy into the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long conversations to the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what does it mean, how could it look like this "Star Trek "-like utopia instead of" matrix "similar diystia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in brief, some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of companies: please ask a capital market, in which one works money, while one works and in which your capital will work from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter what you just works -- is the property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and revenues and the concept of wage work is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between them which belong to the company, but they are not working there, but the company does not hear there. no diver between capital and work, no major gaps between investment and spears, and finally did not reach twin twins.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy: please make sure that our national currencies would have a free slimming exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of whole mankind.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade will be traded in this currency, we call them "The cosmos," in units of "Kosmos" '-- and any government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country in a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in "Green" technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investment funds are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is no new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944 had proposed.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that you did not implement the technical resources at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have, in particular, in particular before the backdrop of a unified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world, which I call you, is simultaneously liberated, in which it was privileged persons, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the Müllers of history, and keynesiastian, global keyboarian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Are we awakening in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or are we going to drop in a "matrix" - similar diystia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer is based on how we decide jointly politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you for.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You bring yourself in your biography itself as a liberal Marxist Marxist.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>

<seg id="983">"" "" "" "the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... do we not do this, the technological development will produce a massive decline in overall economic demand," "" "Larry summers as" "" "long term stagnation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis of a part of the earth on the next, as we see it currently, it will not only destabilize our democracy, but also the countries whose interest in liberally democracy is small.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is applicable, Marx is absolutely relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Similarly, Hayek, that is why I am a liberal Marxist, and how Keynes, and why am I also perfect.</seg>

<seg id="1038">Roy Price has never heard the most, although it is probably responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision, the Roy arrived three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelrisure and describes himself on Twitter as "films, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because it is responsible for the shows and content that will produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fighting industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV-series so that Roy cannot select anything.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must have shows, which are very good, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must shows shows that are located on the right side of this turn.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation division of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Will be your show with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then one has a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows how "Breaking Bath," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that addicted where you have seen a season, your brain asks: "where is there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows how "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should be enough to tell you what is left at that end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not think on the left side of the turn, because I don't need special intelligence to accommodate "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">"" "" "" "he makes more thoughts about the mean hardening, the average television -- the shows that neither good nor bad they are thrill." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he really is on the right hand.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon has something like this, so I want to risk Roy Price.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">It is guaranteed for a guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He participates many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV Shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online where they can take it for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon gives out free things, you don't feel right, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers have seen this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they are observed during the watch of this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team that take all of them.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you're paused, which parts you rejure or look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide on these data they should produce them.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, processing these and this will be the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republican U.S. transators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that many of them cannot remember this show because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve 7.4 is and Alpha House arrives at 7.5 -- so much on average, but not just what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time at another company has a top-show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking for the search to find this a super show and it uses data for it, but it does something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of a competition, he and his team have viewed the existing data on Netflix viewer, so the reviews, which they give the shows, which shows that shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find this small details about the viewer: which shows them, which producers, which actor.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had together all the parts, they went a car, and decided not to make a Sitcom over four transmitters, but a drama series of senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix has hit a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"House of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this turn. so it's exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competent, data reversible companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data, and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic has somehow that all should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision that you meet, then you should meet a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It optimizes it through very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The minimum, what you can expect, is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis is not working, this is a little effort because we live in one time we read more and more to statistics, in order to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody can ever get in contact with this software, so you're in contact with this software.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here in the USA and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is made or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but rather than decide whether a show is good or bad will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Central television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there are evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results. this is not that a company like Multi-Health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data reversible companies are even wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google does sometimes make mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it is likely to say by data analysis of flu, the worst way, predictable -- by data analysis of Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It functioned wonderful and was a great news station. the success gipfelte in a publication in the magazine "Nature".</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked just off, year around year until it didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the release of publication in the magazine "Nature".</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data reversible companies such as Amazon and Google are sometimes misunderstood.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data in the decisions of the life is an -- at the workplace, in the legal framework, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather ensure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very wise men use unimaginable people to make serious decisions, as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognized some samples on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be distributed.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you need to solve a complex problem, do mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a result, this problem is in his individual parts so that you can analyze the individual parts; as well, the individual parts put together in order to set a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you must do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and turn it again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how machtful, can help make a problem to disassemble and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to merge the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we have all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that the brain is good, it is parts and songs together, even if the information is uncomplete, in order to hold a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think was Netflix so successful because they have data and understanding, where they are also in process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">"" "" "" "they use the data to understand their audience," "" "but the decision how to make all these pieces, and make it up a show like" House of Cards "" "," which was not in the data. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, what meant that they went to a large personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on other hand did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first than they chose TV ideas, then called "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they always could say:" "" "we say the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions but I believe that things are wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how machtful they are, data are just one tool, and in order to be forgotten, this instrument is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Thanks to you...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before it was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many people know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it is amazing. for choices via a Ja- or no-question you need to shake the ball to get an answer. "highly likely" -- exactly here in this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will later interpret it with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I met some choices in my life, where I would have listened to the ball in the night.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace this by something much compensation, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic setup.</seg>
<seg id="1135">The ball, perhaps the ball, and klets and classy. finally, it's possible to meet decisions, if we want to reach something unusual at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I felt this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data, it is still paying off to make decisions, an expert on what you do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end, there is not the data, but the risks involved with which you have at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
