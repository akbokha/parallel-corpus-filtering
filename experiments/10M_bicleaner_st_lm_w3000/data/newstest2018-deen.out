Munich 1856 : four maps showing your view to the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where yo@@ ungst@@ ers should meet today .
a tomb chapel , where it is under@@ min@@ ed for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ dener manage the one @-@ way foundation of farmers .
the oldest official map Mün@@ chens promotes exciting stories about days .
there are nervous when maps are not current .
this knows everyone who had to exc@@ it@@ ement himself because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i takes place a green me@@ adow .
historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlantic , an offer by the Ge@@ op@@ ort as Bavaria in the State Government , are all other than currently - but therefore very easy @-@ to @-@ end .
especially if one compar@@ es them with current online cards .
then , cities and communities in the spread @-@ area of Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ epp@@ ich , which is not equal to such as such .
in the large picture postcard , cities and municipalities were used for more detailed maps , so @-@ called urine leaves .
these were originated according to the Bavarian Authority adjustment between 1810 and 1864 and sk@@ ip the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leaders held Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
by Napoleon wanted a review of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bay@@ erns - of course for military purposes .
finally , when French troops returned to the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , February 9 , 1801 , there were the present neigh@@ bors who created the idea of an area @-@ wide Bayern card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph drove the project ahead , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian Authority &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the certificate for Munich dates from 1856 and is like all the others at the Bavarian State Library on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of early spring / today is the example of the provincial capital .
the city has expanded into all directions and has grown together .
for example , the send@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 , is still relatively isolated .
the ship@@ ling was named 21 years after the creation of the map , which is based in the Munich district .
today Unter@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses under@@ ends around 1856 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the Bavarian pe@@ as@@ ants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where the West park is , you can see nothing as fields - at first glance : in the In@@ zo@@ oming , a small @-@ part card with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten book pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; urine &quot; was derived from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small plots spread there today no farmers - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is characterized by the north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
the Theres@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 Show@@ place of the Okto@@ ber@@ fest , was in the 19th century still a me@@ adow and no concrete desert .
on the other side of Is@@ ar there is a historical map insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the jung@@ le sheet , you will not only read the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Guest House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the height &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the air &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Yes , here in the Au@@ er@@ field street one was once more people with mad@@ ness .
there was in 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; emerged in the Au@@ er Lü@@ sts . &quot;
from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ der followed the establishment of the establishment of a psychiat@@ rist who is associated with King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced for his time , and has completed the sale of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he has taught the staff to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , director of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who occupied himself for an exhibition with his arrival .
at first place for 280 patients , later was extended to 500 places .
in some point this capacity was not enough - the reason for the construction of the circul@@ atory system in hair 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ries in Germany .
in the area of former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , yo@@ ungst@@ ers now invites young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and walked in a youth center with training centres .
West is the soccer field of TS@@ V Munich East , East and east of the 1980s .
in 2015 , the Kinder @-@ Haus &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in a architectural re@@ jection to the origin of the origin of the Irish company , which had been destroyed during the Second World War .
the Marien@@ platz was located in 1856 as the main square , &quot; the name of the shopping street was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley &quot; .
a decisive variation made the Second World War also in the heart of Mün@@ ch .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies broke out in December 1944 many holes across the city center .
a large remained until today - on Marien@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a greeting from the Middle Ages , once stood at the Marien@@ hof , where this day will start the pre @-@ work and will take place on April 5 , 2017 .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich card can be compared with the air picture of today - and fill the hole at the Marien@@ hof .
Civil Rights Competition Pub@@ lished traveler for Missouri
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ es has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discrimin@@ ating policy and assistant to the State of Missouri . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri , which is scheduled to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and mis@@ ery , as a number of frag@@ ile , racial @-@ based occurr@@ ences , is stated here in the opinion of the Group .
a recent law of Missouri , which makes people he@@ avier , discrimination against discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , caused by disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate to min@@ orities , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have injuries to human rights , human rights . &quot;
they will be put together because of their skin colour , they are put together or killed , &quot; said the president of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency we have not heard . &quot;
it is the first such warning , which has issued the organization for a state in the United States .
the group cited inci@@ dents such as rac@@ ist offset against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
in the beginning of the year , S@@ anders died of frag@@ ile conditions at the beginning of the year , after having no more gasoline there , and from the police of Missouri was taken away without any crime .
the Council also refers to a recent report by the Office of the General Pro@@ pos@@ an of Missouri , which is shown that black drivers will be more common in the state 75 percent more frequently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and informed their families , friends and employees , what happen in Missouri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people must be willing to bring with us whether to bring together you or to know the relations that they are going to travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , 100 Hass@@ elt , after the latest figures from the Hass@@ ver@@ bre@@ eder report of the FBI , the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the travel is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it difficult , a company because of housing or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the American Civil liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) travel documents for Texas and Arizona , after the states of immigration authorities decided to re@@ prove people because of immigration fraud , resulting in view of AC@@ L@@ U for further rein@@ forcement agencies .
Reis@@ ew@@ ays are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , but in recent days , stakeholders were used to measure the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States .
Wei@@ fence project is Elem@@ ent@@ ar
the Fisch@@ erb@@ ach Wei@@ f@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Bundestag made a picture of Peter white and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac in front of a picture .
at the right @-@ wing of the family of Schwen@@ de@@ mann , representatives of the O@@ erb@@ ach CD@@ U local network met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ uties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann granted insights into its operations , in which he is heated by 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows , and also many young animals and houses in five dwellings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ ald milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative way for the milk of its cows , so sw@@ ing@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the table of the guests the Regional Hotel is exclusively Regional .
since he is also the BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , he described the Wei@@ fence project as &quot; Elem@@ ent@@ ar &quot; .
I can not generate on der@@ art parts .
the gre@@ y@@ land care for a lot of work , worked with the brush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the el@@ ter@@ nal operation and management this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it lead not a bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community has recognized the significance of the electric fence and is delighted with the leader promoting the leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , the farmers would have to be supported .
you hope that the review of the surfaces could be gone out of a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture , and to do thoughts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often in criticism
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the area of conservation amounts to 40 hectares , which are not allowed until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total costs in the amount of EUR 71 500 , half of the leader was funded , a quarter contributed to the Municipality of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach .
thus , the farmers stayed 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of Wei@@ z@@ au@@ n .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; declared Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not make a really good job , without farmers and farmers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter white , there are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best food produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regional Government ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state promotion of fran@@ c@@ ene .
the objective of the Black Forest is the goal of the Black Forest .
a prer@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of a funding of the L@@ PR .
in addition , an enclosed area should not be able to be per@@ me@@ able ( slope of over 35 per cent ) and thus must be threatened by the retention .
the application of eight participants will currently work with 24 plots , who want to build just under 16 kilometers of fence .
the surface area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing more holy ?
now , the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty before
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is , when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans are appreciate the same as every other - hence the def@@ aults to Saddam Hussein &apos;s fall on the Fir@@ dos Square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he was a symbolic au@@ xt in a fierce battle with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CNN on the proposal of the President to dra@@ stic limitation with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CNN .
to stay fair , Miller doesn &apos;t handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ aters and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ers would have claimed him when he had done it .
but he took their mean@@ ings in particular , and in particular the importance given to it as the famous po@@ em by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base has been added .
when Miller best@@ ed A@@ co@@ sta : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go on a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
the po@@ em which you refer to which later was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is objec@@ tively right , but as he formulated it , it is not really about history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about the contemporary response to the laid @-@ up words of Lazarus , the only , in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the trouble of the poor : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your gar@@ bage , your poor , and your oppressed , that desire to bre@@ athe free , and the poor waste of your rich coasts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ dest tr@@ ash &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller committed himself to literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps USA .
this conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who are to use their words after their death on the basis - did a very good result that they complete a high political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Repub@@ lic@@ ism by putting them in a worn classic picture depic@@ ting the femin@@ isation of freedom .
Lazarus Chang@@ ed this meaning : in its po@@ em is the female figure no more abstract - she has received a voice .
and there is a very different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ants .
the connection of the po@@ em with the picture is a brilliant femin@@ ist coffee and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed , the people wanted to re@@ change the people from the right wing .
the big cry of Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was in@@ con@@ founded , but rather an early ne@@ con@@ serv@@ atives , which bring the American flame into the converted world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes forward .
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not shine the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh left here .
the meaning of the statue is quite and a question of the position of perception .
the great imag@@ in@@ ative act of Lazarus was in fact in it to see how they had seen from the exhau@@ sted , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible travels across the de@@ cks of ships .
it &apos;s in the true sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue says to them the words of hope and the welcome that they must hear .
and this is , of course , not the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump ever would like to know .
her tor@@ ch shall not shine the way , but hat@@ red that is their only source of power to ign@@ ites .
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black lo@@ dges Scottish members of the UK
Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle remembered a time when only two vill@@ i were among the UK &apos;s team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the director of the athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent has won a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017 , which starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland something special developed &quot; and the athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom have to learn something from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome you , and we will try it , and we will continue it until we &apos;ll find out &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say with people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with the things that they have done .
British athlet@@ ics : it has something to do with the thing that they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ cher - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m , while Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team to become Captain of Captain .
&quot; Eil@@ id@@ h is quite modest .
their capit@@ ulation was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or where they are living or exercise , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motiv@@ ated .
the passion and the real feeling that Eil@@ id@@ h brought natural , was great . &quot;
the Commonwealth @-@ Silver med@@ ail@@ len@@ ess who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dles , says that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incredibly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is that 16 Sch@@ otten are in the British team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World@@ championship were seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
in the past year , there will be five British and two European records in the past year .
it will be participating in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Sch@@ otte , one of the great season to win the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle remembered her first world championships , as the only other Sch@@ otte was in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the Mannheim capit@@ alisation says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; on the fact that many of their farmers are not only belong to the team , but in some cases also in the medals and with the fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so special about the team capit@@ ulate that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour that my team mates have voted for me and chose me to make it something very special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the vill@@ i who belong to the team .
it just shows how far we came .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to rise to podium .
what are my speech as Chap@@ ter@@ in ?
Yes , I think it was good .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to set up this home support and benefit from it , we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere because without . &quot;
block from Kr@@ iti@@ ves on Facebook : don &apos;t dec@@ eive you for a public office when you do not wear it with voters .
the father of our country knew something of bad news .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of the interior policy until its political principles .
he imp@@ lied with cr@@ iti@@ que , safe .
but he has not brought his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the year 1783 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stup@@ id and silent we will be led like sheep to battles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will bring me to Governor Larry H@@ og@@ an who work to work more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans employees have blo@@ cked the contributions of at least 450 people , who have sold their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ al Union accused him at the beginning of this week .
the staff of the govern@@ ors left the law@@ suit as a fri@@ g , and the online comment was full of counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? &quot;
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it &apos;s especially important when a guy is like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state , the amazing popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ shareholder head .
he has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was also very successfully to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his voters and to debut his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , blocking of persons , which come to the side of the Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , which is officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid in public tax credits - un@@ necessarily and ultimately is dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post @-@ speaking H@@ og@@ ans spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the governor and argu@@ ed that the block@@ age of the comments are nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is too simple to use the image of elec@@ len or sp@@ ans or h@@ asser@@ ate people to use the wh@@ ip online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the post spoke with some of the real people who had been blo@@ cked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only true men who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no tro@@ ug@@ le .
they all told that their comments respec@@ t@@ fully , deliber@@ ately and not prof@@ ited .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and app@@ eals to H@@ og@@ an Catholic faith .
attor@@ ney at Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani from Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not filled with water , but she asked to Hass@@ elt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented , that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to Hass@@ elt and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary area of the news &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want this idea as a number of people on the same theme , then they will be used by some more than a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the staff of the govern@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blo@@ cked a critic or deleted a negative comment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a lot cleaner than in former times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to gather newspapers with critical leaders , and burn or demonstr@@ ators to silence or protest@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but exactly that happens now .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials to critic@@ ized Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users that blo@@ cked from his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County , last the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to the US District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , called a elec@@ tor of her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of an affordable portrait had a similar effect to the Internet .
the number of newspapers negoti@@ ated between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous stamp cap@@ tures on his lead .
and even then Washington had anonymous tro@@ ug@@ le .
the people , the pseud@@ ony@@ ms , such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
pet@@ itions that critic@@ ized his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Great Britain , according to historical documents that were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project .
but he has not brought her to silence .
speech , Expression and Dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation .
and true guide means to accept that .

this event will be his first Scottish gig since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want to make it good , but you feel like this additional pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid Golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad , as far as it went . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

scientists at the University Hospital of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) will come to this result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer accidents are tra@@ ce@@ able on passive smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Master director Hei@@ ko cup &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he moved to this issue of 1994 .
at that time , there have been 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; .
connections are considered very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Road are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lying in the period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the head of the Bau@@ x Fred Hein@@ ze &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the field of hom@@ e@@ connections , the situation is more complicated than thought , since the sub@@ strate is much more berge , which is not stated in the plans .
the traffic , which is always ob@@ struc@@ ted again the construction of construction , represents a large problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ ms of drivers in front of red lights and lock@@ ers are already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses are eligible for passage .

they even use a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Treaty of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally as a &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - right into the fireplace .
after half an hour , the ohl@@ olls will be taken with e@@ ager@@ ly , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed up .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where they can also perform their daily work , for example clothes with fro@@ st water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room is used as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of their husband , you were no fields assigned .
Poly@@ gam@@ ie is common here .
of course it can be too dangerous at work too : most vill@@ men are unemployed , and many drink it &apos;s heavy , and there are the soldiers .
&quot; no one speaks , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; says it .
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ land of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversi@@ al referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 el@@ dest had to vote before the occupying troops .
an existing movement , which touched independence against the Dutch government , turned aside quickly against the government of Jakarta that maintains control of foreign journalists and foreign journalists or legal observation .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided in Papua and West of Papua , whereby the independent part of Papua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so located as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive to the car .
there are no public transport .
the city with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by b@@ am@@ bus@@ hes , and from corrugated ro@@ ofs , which have been converted into various yellow tones by rust .
only very few Indonesia have made their journey here , because journalists and practically no foreig@@ ner .
before the Christian mission@@ aries , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans was a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not acc@@ ust@@ omed to bear these clothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , and indicates their lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , its dar@@ ker shirt and its bright coat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; previously we had only leaves on our body . &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s most popular province , where 28 % of people live under poverty line and some of the worst &apos;s inf@@ ant and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia Gold@@ land .
the biggest and most profitable gol@@ mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land of New Jersey , with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was removed from 3.1 billion US dollars and copper .
in addition , there are over wood resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
but this wealth is a source of affliction for the Papua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s strong military preser@@ ves a military presence .
a study of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort &apos;s local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 had paid almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars on a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anian demands thre@@ aten by bigger autonomy , this golden go@@ ose and will be treated .
according to milit@@ ants , more than 500,000 inhabitants have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 by the Indonesian military , tor@@ tured and detained .
mass@@ ages in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s family @-@ highly country in the 1970 @-@ 60 years were conducted in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for genocide .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we lose all things &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arch@@ di@@ ec@@ z@@ ese Brisbane &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; report in the year 2016 , including un@@ healthy exec@@ utions and torture - rape and con@@ tests are particularly popular - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the bolts are reinforced , because Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development is changed , as Muslim economic migrants come from the popul@@ ated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra , and Sul@@ awes@@ i .

&quot; it has the native Papua - the m@@ um Mama &#91; the women &#93; from Papua - their market cost . &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the folk and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign in 2014 the in@@ equ@@ alities and the legal injuries in Papua .
the former Zimmermann secured 27 out of the 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta .
but in Papua has changed little , and today the loc@@ als are deceived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we have approved 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with anticip@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says you . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai was actually only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two in@@ dones@@ ian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle by the darkness .
the ro@@ cking children told them that they should be dis@@ connected their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers participated in their tone and later came with four soldiers , so the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , pursued , and struck the group with their ri@@ fl@@ es , spoke victims and witnesses .
then , one of the soldiers killed in the group of children .
one child , the 16 year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so difficult to get that he fell into the Com@@ a .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and the things es@@ cal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military commander Centre to request justice .
they carried out wood@@ lands and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle and led a bird @-@ singing im@@ it@@ ating - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to cut stones on police and military po@@ sten .
when the atmosphere was heated , a command was sent over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; is it not released in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released in local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatened risk and called to rest and ur@@ ged the amount to return home .
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned back my left hand , I joined my left hand in my left hand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame is still not yet , who has fired , but says that the ball came out of the rows of the two soldiers .
&quot; it was crow@@ ded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I went and instructed his body to make sure that he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who bears only one name , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TI@@ ME &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief spec@@ tro@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said repor@@ ters that his officers could only ass@@ ure their station only &quot; because they are attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua @-@ police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ list@@ i@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
the news about the b@@ uns appeared only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jakarta .
three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate talk in Jay@@ ap@@ ura in which he sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims , and weak@@ ened the historic ab@@ uses in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want that this case is immediately solved , so it will not happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he would direct a extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations .
but the talk began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred before long time .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to go through these bre@@ aches , but there are processes that must pass through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto made a re@@ treat than he spoke on June 5th in Jakarta with TI@@ ME and said , He has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .
instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto , accused of crimes against humanity , called for more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence from 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been buried in Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were contrary to such alleg@@ ations with fierce un@@ believers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times four times , but there was no progress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he is still alive in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are anxi@@ ety to discuss the incident .
he says that he was defeated by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I was buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , he sought the military after me , &quot; he says .
the sli@@ pp@@ ies have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police seized the vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ front@@ ation between village residents and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring an conscious man to hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dr@@ unken , when he was in a nearby river , died on the way into the hospital .
the indigenous vill@@ agers were protest@@ ed in front of the company &apos;s site .
the police said that the vill@@ agers were cast into officers , they responded by themselves to wet warning shots .
but loc@@ als say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian par@@ amil@@ itary police ) began to shoot and killed one .
&quot; we were so in pan@@ ic , we have fear that it is reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lived in the vicinity of the hospital , and his witness as the last of the last here is , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai parliament is called to withdraw the officers to withdraw and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the Police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a troub@@ les@@ hip for the Indonesian government .
the lack of sen@@ su@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many of them joined the &quot; Free State Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebellion , asser@@ ted to defend the rights of Papua , by combining spor@@ adic attacks and demonstrations of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leader origin@@ ate from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Y@@ og@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ oya .
in response to thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai , thousands of people were arrested and arbitr@@ ary in custody , under the pre@@ text of the &quot; securing of national so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty . &quot;
some people never go up again .
among men in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tra@@ gic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is quite expensive for loc@@ als .
bread is equally except range .
all people build everything they eat : mainly Not@@ a and fruit and leaf vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potato products .
they reserve the majority of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces Not@@ a precious only 10.000 in@@ dones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic in@@ equ@@ alities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in bigger number since the opening of new flight routes to Nab@@ ire Airport .
the few jobs , which are in the region , usually come to the better trained and we@@ al@@ thy migrants .
they rarely do the capital or the necessary skills to make their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions in the reporting of international media are ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , the French journalist Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported to the number of coordination with related institutions from Papua , even though the rare permission was given to the movies .
according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaigns were able to boost the restrictions on reporting to ensure transparency and development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists , who try to report from Indonesia to a peaceful provinces of Papua and Western papers : visa @-@ ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains limited to the immediate neigh@@ bors Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine and the Salom@@ one Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have histor@@ ically seen the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there is free media , so it is difficult to alter the evidence of human rights . &quot;
people want to know that more foreign governments should take this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of human rights , Ke@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura lost their silence and oppressed him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that participated in the session , but also anonymous .
Indonesia has a further presidential election , but the Papua say that it probably will not be able to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is involved of people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uts , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Board of Directors .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from it that it is among the constant thre@@ ats of a rob@@ ber@@ ian military , is located in arm@@ ist@@ rates and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like others Papua , their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i than a &quot; bl@@ ame &quot; must consider that he must pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need money , they want only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the thre@@ ats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ings , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uss@@ an had a last symbolic act of p@@ ite : the bodies of an Op@@ ens was buried in a terrain that was buried in the police and the military station .
they may not know that they will never be righteousness , but at least they will not forget the persons responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a direct head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers from Dubai for the second time
a fire was found on Friday in one of the highest residence of the world in Dubai . hundreds of inhabitants , dating back to the 337 @-@ metre high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that is located in just two years by the high @-@ house , which is called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we stood at the fire alarm and the cry of the people .
we were down the stairs down , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; telling the inhabitants of his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 AM local time ( 00@@ .00 am GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cool .
the government said that they are working on providing accommodation for the person concerned .
the incident may have any questions regarding the safety of materials that are used in outdoor areas of buildings around the world , revi@@ ve .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 , revealed that the largest part of the damage caused by the facing , the outer covering for decoration or isolation .
in Britain the police said they believe that the system of plates for isol@@ ating insulation and covering at the London Gren@@ ade Tower could have contributed to the spread of a Bran@@ des , at which approximately 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis prohibited ( IT@@ F ) has fallen by his large Davis Cup @-@ Cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , the Davis Cup single was only supported for this sport revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two winning players , but Hau@@ ch@@ thin supports the required two @-@ third majority .
although often very long , but also very well @-@ estimated five sentence classic will remain to the traditional race .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member states voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ g@@ ty , therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations did not have the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ g@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work to improve the applicants .
even until the vote was not only ready for the vote , the proposal has come to place the final at a neutral site .
new from 2018 only compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be announced in the subsequent year in the first round of the host right .
in order to reduce the costs for the organis@@ er , the requirements for training places etc. makes it easier and the players must be completed prior to the Davis Cup for less official media dates .
more than 1 out of 5 US trav@@ ellers bring objects into plane , finds a pol@@ l out
a survey conducted among passengers showed that more than 20 per cent consci@@ ously or un@@ consci@@ ously prohibited items apply to the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent which contributed to the aircraft while they were acci@@ dentally powered knife or other objects with blades contributed .
less than 1 per cent claimed they would have discovered that they travelled ast@@ ron@@ eous with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition , or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people - who was conducted by a jet @-@ charter service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger trav@@ ellers appro@@ ve the rules .
of the respon@@ dents , they refused to fly with anything that was forbidden by T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , who were members of Generation X .
the most common objects used to be buried in T@@ SA agents , foods and liquids .
more than 3 per cent , they are useful to have carried out objects by security control , while 2.2 percent of women survey@@ ed and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents have also confirmed that they had failed .
the company said it is travelers to find travelers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally caused dirt products caused by airport security and how many it had done it .
there is no surprise that people who are in the most beautiful sm@@ ug@@ ly en@@ ware - knowing or ignor@@ ant - by the security , those who are most frequently flying .
however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA guidelines are something complicated and conf@@ used .
people are often un@@ sure to carry any fluids , or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of objects used by the T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated items .
for a time they thought people , the T@@ SA could view books as a sm@@ ug@@ ly ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers . order
&quot; &quot; &quot; electric @-@ thous@@ and@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k are happy with the huge number of orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , he has failed to date that part of the customer has withdrawn its commitment to its commitment .
in addition to the turn@@ able figures for sales growth and more gig@@ antic sales destinations Tesla @-@ Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k has seen another , less powerful number : the cancellations made during the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k had frequently dealt with more than 500,000 orders for the new car over the past months , which is scheduled for delivery .
now Mus@@ k is a : of total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 orders have already been withdrawn again .
critics always had noted again that it is only for non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , the 1000 Euro ( US dollars ) will be paid in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) .
currently , 45@@ 5,000 of these non @-@ binding reservations , Mus@@ k appeared in a telephone conference with anal@@ ysts .
if the cancellation of up to date only twelve percent of all orders have to become problem , the Tesla chief does not believe .
his argument : the challenge of the ambitious growth target is not in demand , but on the production page .
last year Tesla 84@@ ,000 vehicles delivered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2018 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let all models have taken together - 500,000 will be one million by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are 1800 bookings per day .
who today ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; in the second half of 2018 with delivery - if Tesla creates it to drive its n@@ ag@@ el@@ new , never in practice tested production lines without greater access to the maximum occupancy rate .
many experts doub@@ ts that this is possible .
but it is too bigger del@@ ays , then the un@@ binding of the reservations may become a problem for Tesla .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the company can &apos;t be satisfied with satisfied customers in pairs of swe@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt moves on to reduce emissions from Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
a day after he was accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , rejected his previous decision to reduce the implementation of the Obama era , to reduce emissions from smo@@ g pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ ster presented the change when his agency proved to be the needs of state environmental authorities in comparison to existing administr@@ ations .
he mentioned the complaint was not mentioned against his previous job in a German Federal Court of Appeal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a deadline that ran for States on 1 October to comply with the standards of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ sted , in June that he would not hesitate to give compliance with a year , to give the plan more time to study the plan and to avoid the economic growth &quot; in local decisions . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable opponent for environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has gone to block , regul@@ ating or delayed to block the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden return from Wednesday is the latest legal return for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal State Court in Washington decided that the EPA comm@@ its authority has exceeded his authority when he tried to implement the Obama administration , the oil and gas company to monitor the monitoring and reducing of me@@ than@@ le@@ cks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt faced that his K@@ ehr@@ t@@ wende at o@@ zone standards just struck the read@@ iness of the EPA for cooperation with the states through the complex process of just@@ ify the new standards .
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often not kept the dead@@ lines for the implementation , and then to be accused of activ@@ ating activists and others , and in an agreement the EPA said more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in a regulation of trial procedures , and we assume dead@@ lines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the opinion of EPA , that P@@ ru@@ sted sometime continued his &quot; powers to delay and all other law made available to ensure that the rules &quot; is based on a solid politics and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the congress will rush to a more comprehensive re@@ version of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last month of approval , the implementation of the rules of 2015 should be delayed by at least eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the process was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York Pro@@ curator @-@ At@@ tor@@ ney , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the states that the EPA said within this week , said the group intended to maintain statutory pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ al of the EPA - according to our bodies - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.7 million Americans , which are directly affected by smo@@ g who exu@@ des in their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York included in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil @-@ o@@ zone arises , if pollutants from cars , power plants , oil ingen@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the col@@ oring Smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups , and contribute to thousands of premature death cases each year .
representatives of Public Health and Environment Management across P@@ ru@@ itts surprising exchange changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is troubled how much pressure needs to get this reasonable step of the responsible for the protection of the air which we bre@@ athe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight against the ide@@ ological cross of the Tr@@ ump government , to tackle environmental pollution and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Society intends to check approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not want a legal prer@@ equ@@ is@@ ite for the construction and therefore has turned on the landing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; has been asked to return Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) , its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on December 30 , 2016 at Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette even have no wind power plants could have been appro@@ ached , as at the time in square only on the municipal border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal , a wind power concentration zone exists .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are possible in principle , at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind turbines for the other town area .
the zones must prevent a &quot; prevention &quot; of the landscape .
a few days ago , the town of Vier@@ sen had decided to decide a second wind force zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but the Düsseldorf District government had not appro@@ ached , because of a formation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the lack of plan@@ ing legal prer@@ equ@@ is@@ ite , the approved approval must be returned to such as illegal and therefore , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current state of Things : the Stad@@ thalle once again decided the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , an authorization of the District government is still valid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ kens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines are excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of a collection .
&quot; the respective letters have been received since last week at the circle of Vier@@ sen , &quot; declared a speaker .
the circle takes them to check the matter again .
however , they probably do not lead that the procedure is stopped .
with a view of the ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle was not des@@ irable to refer to the arg@@ um@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; to date .
NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning to build on a surface at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four per 200 meters high angles .
the company had already been involved in the city of Vier@@ sen @-@ bar in the past year , P@@ acht@@ agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land closed .
with erection of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households can be covered , this corresponds to around one fifth of the electricity demand of all four @-@ stroke households .
the NEW re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , there was a green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as a shar@@ ehol@@ ding at a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .

Tr@@ ump put under @-@ handed tran@@ scription by telephone call in Mexico under pressure on the payment of the border
tran@@ scription by telephone call between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump in a telephone call with the Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto on , hearing to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president imp@@ lied him because he had publicly cancelled the wall . according to report he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with promise to build a wall in the southern border of the USA , and s@@ ware , Mexico for the project .
Tran@@ scription of his first lawyer , with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ st@@ ale , were also published and revealed an un@@ question@@ ed exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said , &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said that a trade for the USA refugees trying to acquire &quot; ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stup@@ id , &quot; and that the existence of the United States would like to look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; when he had proposed a ban on res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US .

Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ person Ford Mercury run by a group of viewers in the rural Monroe , Georgia , and moved to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white rider , the bridge could reach a group of white men with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the Mo@@ bs - a man @-@ aged age in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous membrane - took a long train on its cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside moved the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ aring the man .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
cri@@ es in silence , when a young black man was torn apart from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , only one night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if a loop is thrown by the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all the audience were very genuine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , Citi@@ zen returned to the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to meet the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ sey , and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey , had been gel@@ yn@@ x in 1946 .
no one was charged because of the murder .
&quot; it is truly unbe@@ atable that in all these years , no one person was arrested , although we know it in our churches , though we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks who assi@@ sts in the organization of re@@ location .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden of our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year old con@@ gres@@ sman of the State of Georgia and a living person .
it serves as a dramatic call to action as a dramatic call to conduct and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to be prosec@@ uted , we want the termination , we want to do healing , but first we must receive righteousness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to cure and reconciliation until we receive righteousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a judicial medi@@ ator puts a wal@@ let on the cor@@ ks of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford Lyn@@ chens on 27 July 1946 .
according to the FBI files that were obtained from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding ridge were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but nobody was ever charged .
although the susp@@ ects has been on free feet for decades , civil rights , that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions were always known throughout the city : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court ruled the black citizens in Georgia for the first time , at the fore@@ ground in summer .
at about the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ com felt a white corn@@ erst@@ one , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - supp@@ os@@ edly because of a woman .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bro@@ oks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that rum@@ our had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy , and that the baby was born of her husband , not of her husband . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white farm owner , 600 dollars to release Mal@@ col@@ m from prison , the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her Cou@@ sins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey in prison .
but when they went away from prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge came near , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b reached the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and arranged Mor@@ de , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; includes a FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is obvious that there was a lot between the state and local criminal prosecution that was not only involved in the murder , evi@@ den@@ ced evidence and promised the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks form@@ ulates it even more fun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a election massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you agree and if you agree , then you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene led the annual presentation of Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her representation is vivid , moving and is in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of whom many believe that it does not exist in America anymore .
it is difficult to look , and yet more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we are con@@ fron@@ ted with their wat@@ ery in us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build any relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of black - in a room and l@@ ur@@ ged , when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ at@@ co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the head @-@ cl@@ an member since years , but he said that I will never be easier .
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to get this story in life because we don &apos;t want to return to this times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room tested the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , its lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ col@@ com , the he@@ d@@ ester and troubled him that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; I said , n --- he , missing from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona er@@ wi@@ sted the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks out ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at lau@@ rel .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; he asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ im@@ pover@@ ished and conf@@ used .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still k@@ ich@@ ern@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos; n &apos; n &apos; said &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; funny one of the other black actors .
&quot; you must only meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and precisely , the energy in the room is moving in the room , a feeling of camera works replaced the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is working with this , that right now , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene once starts .
this time , when sh@@ all@@ ying the N word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this repet@@ ition ends violent and quickly .
there are cry , shots and then silence .
a woman clothed with a gra@@ pe @-@ dress , stands on the cor@@ p@@ ses of actors and leads cheap holidays tru@@ sting Lo@@ bre@@ de &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; .
her voice breaks out for every second word .
about a hundred meters behind , a group of about four dozen spectators swe@@ at swe@@ at and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided evenly between black and white .
a pair is made from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , in order to see the performance , many coming only the road .
they experienced nearly eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as cr@@ ushing moisture , when bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point , the Mor@@ de remained an A@@ nec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if you found on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de is felt , the air felt at the way .
if the final notes of the songs , Gre@@ ene invites the people to come closer and inspec@@ ting the dead body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children ho@@ ist on their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing to each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ mu@@ red for a little boy , as he would like to remind you of it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes the Gre@@ ene of the amount - and suddenly it is over .
the actors cast the Lyn@@ ch rope and wi@@ pe their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw um@@ im@@ pover@@ ished Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit which the Cl@@ an@@ ship has played .
Nick Ras@@ hid im@@ pover@@ ished two of his fellow players and then breaks out into their poor , the emotional load of the performance finally breaks out with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ per@@ ing one of the women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this from a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience continues with the actors for dinner together .
at a table , a white pair of Atlanta excited about the follow @-@ up with a black pair , which they had just learned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had fought words to find words that he has left the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people who look like yourself and do it , because they look like , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really do with me can believe me that the Lyn@@ ches still continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks Courtyard keeps on his table , he will rec@@ alls and remin@@ is@@ cent of civil rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said he began to plan the performance in the next year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is inspir@@ ing in a certain way , because she describes the terror of what we bear , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like that we can &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whoever doesn &apos;t study his own story , he who doesn &apos;t know his own story is sentenced to repeat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in 2013 , he had to leave a g@@ ell@@ ent wh@@ ist@@ ling concert in 2013 , there were five years later , in which the &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; stopped .
Katharina Wagner is likely to have been pleased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience have not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf but it also has grown understanding for its visibility .
I will draw a positive res@@ ume .
Max amount works as a volunteer
they work in their volunteers under several sites .
where to everywhere ?
quantity : usually in stone frank@@ furt in the furniture train , once a week I help you in Gre@@ ven in the Fur@@ nit@@ ure bridge .
and I worked in the open all day at the school .
how are your experiences with that ?
amount : it is a nice , broad spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years old , so late vocational volunteers .
how does that come ?
quantity : I did high school .
and then a civil engineering studies , let &apos;s say , successfully canc@@ eled .
I recognized for me that it is for me , and I want to do something else to work with people .
and then I asked me what are doing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make a social year , there &apos;s an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the burning point , perhaps , really is . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and was it like that ?
lots : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
I will be able to study dual , probably at the Youth Office Her@@ ne takes a social worker and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not anything common to have several different applications during volunteers ?
quantity : Yes , it is very variable .
it always comes on , where one makes his FS@@ J .
it can make it from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very diversi@@ fied .
I was partly in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care .
for me , that was exactly the right thing that has sli@@ pped me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs .
different than in civil engineering ?
quantity : sure , here it &apos;s not about to calculate St@@ ati@@ ken .
you always have other people about the head , which each have a completely different history behind .
whether a refugee family has been brought up from the family - one must always go individually .
very interesting .
and they had no touch anxi@@ ety ?
quantity : I am not the guy .
it is a field that gives a lot .
much love , much kindness .
there are also negative moments , but so it is that life .
Pear@@ son den@@ ds another 3,000 jobs and dis@@ ma@@ sts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British Education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividend by 72 per cent as another restructuring program was launched in order to overcome the pressure with which the company is con@@ fron@@ ted .
the Stell@@ ako , Director @-@ Director John Fall@@ on , mainly planned for the end of 2018 at the beginning of 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which had already lost 4,000 jobs .
in May , Pear@@ son announced a plan for a cost @-@ cost reduction plan by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast step of digital learning .
the company , which had sold his participation in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann in last month , said that the outlook for the business year remains unchanged , after the first half of the year has achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2,@@ 05 billion pounds .
con@@ voy attack by Kabul : NATO @-@ soldier killed in suicide attacks
a suicide bom@@ bers attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kabul , killed one of NATO soldiers and viol@@ ated several other leaders .
five soldiers and interpre@@ ters were viol@@ ated , a Declaration of Nato members .
the confirmed local reports were estimated that three civilians were killed during the incident in the district of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan had met this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ bers killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul .
in a position of NATO &apos;s position , it was done that the explosion occurred on Thursday night when a common pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a group of persons impro@@ vised . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the testimony says that all the last in a stable condition are and in the U.S. military hospital at Bag@@ ram . &quot; &quot; &quot;
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide @-@ suicide car of at least 30 people killed in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kabul .
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
on 31 May , a tremend@@ ous bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack by the country , since the US forces seized the Taliban in 2001 .
violence under@@ lines the pre@@ m@@ ative security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering that the number of U.S. forces supporting military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dent say that the suicide attacks in Kabul may also have a crisis of public trust in the government , its policy , and especially in the call of President Ash@@ raf Gh@@ ani .
EPA returns the delay for smo@@ g rule after complaints about smo@@ g rule .
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to refuse a regulation of the government of Obama , in which the states are obliged to destroy the smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 States accused the agency because of the st@@ ep@@ per st@@ ep@@ per .
the EPA announced late in Wednesday the decision to describe the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone regulations &quot; in 2015 , and said that they show the obligation of the agency to collabor@@ ate with states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt was announced in June the intention of the EPA , the o@@ zone regulations , in which part of the country damage should be measured in order to determine where cuts must be made to strict air quality standards - to be delayed by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint filed on Tuesday , saying that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to impos@@ e a wide range of environmental pollution , which the former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda , to spur growth in terms of Tr@@ ump .
however , the efforts have caused the set@@ backs of democracy and conservation groups that make wor@@ ried about the effects of larger emissions to public health .
the EPA website says that the in@@ hal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; lung function and increase re@@ spir@@ atory symptoms &quot; as for example as@@ thma .
municipal plan to communal space
at the end , the decision was clear : with two opponents , the Municipal Council decides on the establishment of a joint venture to the establishment of a community living room in the future .
before discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still lack of jurisdiction is signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
indeed , I &apos;ll still take until the community &apos;s community is in possession of the community , but there is no plans for that of a private investor for st@@ em@@ m@@ ating project .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors , which are still in the boat , offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor it would provide a living space of approximately 55 square meters - and an ad@@ joining terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the council decided to see such a community space as the meeting point only for the residents of sen@@ i@@ fying just residence , but open to the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ cafe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision , which has already been decided by providing means of funds for the current budget in the past autumn , by funding possibilities .
the construction is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common room would be reported , as reported by T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 per cent of 30 percent .
the decision is to sign@@ alize the investor that you want to throw him in this regard , that there is no kno@@ bs between the legs , and that which is close to ambient conditions - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which would be the tr@@ ash @-@ height and the construction of economic power - it would be possible .
unnecessary , this is not just Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this additive .
if it helps : unanimously he passes the panel .
it is not so simple as it is common .
Daniela responded to the many own buildings where you don &apos;t come right forward , but now sit in a common room from the window , says it : &quot; I would like to make me hard . &quot;
Y@@ v@@ onne Sta@@ iger speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
she looks behind a ver@@ r@@ alled maximinum payout of Kur@@ s@@ able or even Foreign Invest@@ ors .
this is not so , because with the acquisition of the area you should give a sub@@ sid@@ y , but I get a real , in case of doubt the equivalent value is the counter .
Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s application , accordingly to the decision of the decision , finds three fears .
thus it remains in two opponents to summar@@ ize the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller so summar@@ ises : &quot; if we receive the decision , we will make a huge step in our infrastructure . &quot;

hiking in the Har@@ z from Stern to Stern
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the har@@ z the nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star@@ path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to emer@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planning the Ob@@ servatory Ob@@ servatory Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary route in Göttingen since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star arrow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come to meet the need of many har@@ z@@ men to meet the fact . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he binding nature , science , movement , and sporting performance .
the members want to set up the planned route plates and get informed about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
in the first phase to 2018 the club &quot; well @-@ achiev@@ able installations are planning in five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z .
issue St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ e@@ ge@@ i@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tablets are supposed to be completed by the internet .
therefore , a good mobile network will play a role in the site selection .
accessi@@ bility is a crit@@ erion .
later the star@@ path train should be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path the viewer can learn much knowledge , for example above the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association declared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned , why stars could have different colors or why a star is stronger than another , although it is much more distant .
also , in which constellation can find out a selected star , and when he was best to see .
the association has been operating in the city center of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg in 2014 , located at the highest town in northern Germany .
the location in the middle of the Har@@ z National Park counts according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation and the six dar@@ k@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently , from there are the milk road and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , at the initiative of the Planet@@ arium in Göttingen , there is a little similar to the planned death of the planet .
starting in front of prayer hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary route runs up to Hain@@ berg and ob@@ servatory and ob@@ servatory in Di@@ emar@@ den ( municipality of same ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the st@@ ems with the single plan@@ ets - including the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed p@@ lu@@ to at the end - are exactly on the distance and scale of one to two billion scale .
the earth sh@@ run@@ k a ball of 6.5 mm in diameter , while the sun measures exactly 75 meters from the sun .
the total distance of the planetary route is just four kilometers .
during the light from sun to P@@ lu@@ to about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour up to the camels with P@@ lu@@ to .
pede@@ stri@@ ans are so qu@@ icker than the light in the world .
the march to the next fixing , but would last half a year .

&quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; remembered Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I got up for Br@@ oner &#91; to 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big .
I am small for 140 .
I would like to go down to light weight .
and he must move on the lightweight design &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then fight .
they ask the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko voted on .
&quot; boxing needs this struggle . &quot;
Kli@@ mas asked whether it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy , to make Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year , in order to make a date on the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell , after their lightweight cover contest in the forum on September 23 .

no other name may produce this kind of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he approaches Lom@@ ach@@ enko , as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko , at the generous praise for Gar@@ cia , said that he consider the tri@@ athlon champion from River@@ side &quot; very slow , I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to get the K@@ o @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus is to show stroke force , then boxing .
both told , they could feel the Mom@@ entum , who built himself for their own struggle .

four j@@ acks for ty@@ re plac@@ er
on Thursday afternoon , four people were injured as part of an accident on the A7 .
after the first information we lost the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira to 16.30 shortly before the connection of the market , probably after a ty@@ re space it will be control over his vehicle .
car from the car to the right to the ar@@ ming , where he struck and then remained on the roof at the grave .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were bad@@ ly injured during the accident .
during the first supply of the last through the rescue service , A7 toward the north was locked for about one hour , then traffic on the left side could be buried on the left .
continuation Hoffmann : &quot; rotation chain works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann is tax@@ ed after the 2 : 2 season open@@ er to Braunschweig that optimi@@ zing the rein@@ forcement formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first seasonal game , Andre Hoffmann was happy with the result , there were not the two opponents in the 2 : 2 in Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were two opponents too much , and we have to get better in au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ences of Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the thresh@@ ing chain is to be optimised further in the Erz@@ gebirge .
and a gate after a fre@@ est@@ or don &apos;t want to capture the progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) to the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team also comes better after the experiences in preparation with the rotation chain better than the four @-@ ring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is of his cause , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have just said in the turning chain to the sem@@ it@@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a prer@@ equ@@ is@@ ite , but that we are better harmon@@ ious , and we will not aff@@ ord to work so many playing errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann moved to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether one cannot speak after a mis@@ er@@ able start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could well be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we can concentrate on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the poker table , we will certainly speak of a regular season open@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wanted to know his trainer nothing .
&quot; the start into the season I did not know after six to eight playing days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t like to speak of an advantage over au@@ ctions , only because the game of Saxony has to be cancelled due to an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann too , that the players from au@@ e maybe even could be something fresh , because they had no he@@ avier and complete game like Fortuna against an asc@@ ending f@@ avo@@ red in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know as 100 percent where they are currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Interior of the Fortuna . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although guests arrive from the Rhineland as a lighter favorite on Sunday in the meeting at the finally ( almost ) finished stadium from Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we carry them away , only because we are entitled to come under the first six , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blasphem@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is absolutely positive with just one defeat against au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no crew in the 2 . Bundesliga , which you have to strike by pre @-@ in , &quot; explained to the Executive Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such statement would be to meet ar@@ ro@@ gant and adul@@ ter@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so , Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum evaluation tests released
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden has under@@ gone a new method for medical evaluation of their age , that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes on the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ ens@@ ische Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ p ) has begun with the implementation of tests in the past year .
they should be more precise during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish mig@@ rant authority ( mig@@ rant workers ) due to failure to assess the correct age of some refugees were critic@@ ised .
to date , Mig@@ r@@ ation@@ et 6,@@ 880 has been refresh@@ ed and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests in the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eighty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency evaluated that the person could possibly be 18 years or older .
in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests will be conducted only in cases where the age of the person is question@@ ed .
according to Johan Go@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constantly growing during the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a great difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person has been assessed than 18 years , does not necessarily means that the asylum seek@@ ers should be weighed over its age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there should be 4@@ 42 cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; propose that the person concerned was 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the newspaper sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det the 5@@ 81 results published , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person said that she will be 18 years old .
the method of the medical age condem@@ nation , with the X @-@ ray recordings of the prophecy , and MRI capture of k@@ nee joints are analyzed , which are critic@@ ized by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a sk@@ ep@@ tics is the end@@ ocr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work comprises the assessment of biological irrit@@ ation of people to see if they were earlier or later usually by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about this , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used .
the biological age can be evaluated in this way , is very un@@ safe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it safe , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Go@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency def@@ ended the accuracy of tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk , a child as an adult is in@@ correct , is small .
the greatest risk is in this case , if the person is under 18 , this case is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in Plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is well ahead .
on Wednesday a seven @-@ ton concrete part was installed at the east entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good in time , it will be great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Bau@@ Manager at the Department of Road and Transport in the Government of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the work started to work at all three renov@@ ating bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
construction is scheduled for October and is sure that the schedule will be observed .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault out of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
it is now like the other bridges , it has come into the years now .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge on the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called glasses .
this is a Rand@@ om that is used as an operating instructions .
on Friday the southern part of the bridge is supposed to be equipped with a width of 2.@@ 20 meters .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to run .
the special thing is that there is a patent for manufacturing parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ prints carried out the laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre optic cables connected to which many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed about the project in advance of the project .

Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ ump@@ y to protest in German potato sal@@ at
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not so often that parties are moving to a strand but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to bring with a hat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the parties in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Grün@@ e , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Lin@@ ke ) belong to a broad alliance , which shows the A@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell into a poster campaign of &quot; great campaign of campaign . &quot;
and well @-@ known names to the start - how Alice Wei@@ del , together with Alexander Gau@@ land , forms the leading duo for the German Bundestag election on 24 September , and the Deputy President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those that are already hours before the start of the event , don &apos;t want to listen to the A@@ D @-@ lern , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot;
originally , the town @-@ pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; All on a table &quot; on the fountain area , but is now place on the parking below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the A@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that has been there .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the forum One World and one of the decisive organis@@ ers , really pleased : &quot; great , how many people are here together . &quot;
there are music and plenty of food , among them a &quot; German potato sal@@ at that could easily eat the Af@@ ak easily , &quot; says the woman who brought him .
the police dispos@@ es of many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence in particular at the station , which is just a few meters from the venues .
how is the Af@@ D actually came on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ ak Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel reported to ende@@ av@@ our and to receive a supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked at first in Dau@@ n , but there is a cancellation because of the already built Laur@@ enti@@ us kir@@ ch not enough parking available .
so now the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; overlooking the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the good right to people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does it : at 20 o &apos;clock on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle diverse speakers , including the Rhineland @-@ p@@ fäl@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ Chair Uwe Young .
in the hall , about 200 list@@ eners , who are waiting for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chairman of the Federal President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch will keep their spe@@ eches .
unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than one hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is short after 21 hours .
the police can sh@@ aken - no special inci@@ dents .

Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her bis@@ exual

&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Kri@@ sten Stewart completely openly about her bis@@ exual . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I beat in gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

or do you think about , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten gave it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and believed in du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never been conf@@ used or ob@@ struc@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never liked it never to be seriously treated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the &quot; Bang show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in the school period , as they prefer just like a bush : &quot; not all the girls are typical girls .
that didn &apos;t really hurt me .
when I was eleven , I told me the children , I would like a bush .
I felt really attacked , changing and disappointed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; particularly the public they would not like to live their love , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The people expect you to come in a certain way , and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps they call me some , but I don &apos;t like to just@@ ify me before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Governor Justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayer and lots of thoughts ... today I will tell you as a inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I &apos;m a Democratic Governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a coach I would say that it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice approved not the democratic candidate of Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes represents that he has du@@ sted cab@@ ines in five states , and have inher@@ ited a carbon business from his father .
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued a declaration on Thursday night in which it said : &quot; the Party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party which would like to work with us to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 Gou@@ vy and control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice only is the last ref@@ usal of a party , which is from above to below without leadership , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ Chair R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a statement about C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CO@@ E lo@@ ys &quot; hon@@ est &quot; Russian ap@@ ologies for D@@ oping sc@@ andal
the worldwide b@@ oss of athlet@@ ics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday that he described as obvious exc@@ use from Russia to a D@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated , it was not the moment for the country to be resumed in the sport .
Russia &apos;s athlet@@ ics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the World Athletics Championships on the eve of the athlet@@ ics world championships that the exile of his country was in the sport , and that he decided to fight the doping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the athletes born in competitions with gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban which was imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) has found evidence of state @-@ sponsored D@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very hon@@ est presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire congress were that the Russian Federation has recognized itself in itself that she has experienced some rather hot times and everything will be able to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Beyond that Russia accept the criteria for his re@@ launch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day , and I think it was achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment , Russia back , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will begin at the World Athletics Championships , which begin on Friday in London , after the strict IA@@ AF criteria as a neutral actors .
the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Andersen , said on Monday that Russia still fulfill some of the criteria for a recovery .
thr@@ ott@@ ings are still in@@ sufficient and prohibited train@@ ers are still free of charge , he said Rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .

doub@@ ts of the UN Mission in Mali was not considered dangerous by the Le@@ yen : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of high significance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country , which we are separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral , the S@@ är@@ ge were brought out of the cathedral .

Prince Hen@@ rik is no grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried in his wife next to his wife .
that divided the royal house on Thursday .

the queen , who agree with the decision of her husband , called it further in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still un@@ clear .
but he did not have the intention to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik never made a command that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would like to be king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and put the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; princ@@ ess &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew to the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had in his almost 50 @-@ year old ra@@ iny with the Dan@@ es a heavy stand .
in a car biography , Hen@@ rik over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything was happening , critic@@ ised .
my Danish was s@@ lim@@ ming , I preferred wine instead of beer , so@@ cks instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I like instead of Virginia tobacco smoke and they were able to have the reputation to be the brand of soci@@ ally critical intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were just two mist@@ akes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants to re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) will not return to the loss of red @-@ green governments for a rapid re@@ election of the Parliament , but it doesn &apos;t want to return .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he spoke of the Parliament &apos;s dis@@ solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising exit of a Green @-@ M@@ EP@@ s from their land freight in Lower Saxony was over@@ thrown by the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election the red @-@ green coalition lost their kn@@ itted one @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the old gre@@ enery of the El@@ ke T@@ li@@ fe@@ jack@@ ets founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; declared it on Friday in Hannover .
CD@@ U faction leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend it to his group .
with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP have 69 seats in Lower Saxony country , SPD and Grün@@ e 68 seats .
so far the ratio was vice vers@@ a .
the new Parliament will be elected by the 14th of January .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether they could continue in this situation without a majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan Weil holds , however , it is indispensable for an indispensable thing that the land will be possible quickly to its self @-@ resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U @-@ S &amp; D Group is expected to decide on more information on Tuesday .
the state cap@@ turing also provides the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s Parliament has been de@@ pri@@ ved , and cho@@ oses a successor to the Prime Minister .
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
these possibilities must be legally inspected , &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in peace all questions be distur@@ bed if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler named T@@ West &apos;s step &quot; but somewhat cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the policy in himself stressed : &quot; I &apos;m not griev@@ ous .
I feel very good . &quot;
they described themselves as a tra@@ jec@@ tor of black @-@ green .
the gre@@ enery sought the downhill dep@@ uties for the return of their land dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are of course that she has received her landing crafts , which gives you over the green state list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divided the President Meta Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president of the Gre@@ et Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regre@@ ts the decision of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are aware of aware of , no hiding in the group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the background , there was no content differences , we can not re@@ prove this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the survivors of the Lower Saxony @-@ dep@@ uties El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to CD@@ U as tre@@ ason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former green members in Lower Saxony is not only tre@@ ason to voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal to red @-@ green &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Social Democrats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote on Facebook on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re @-@ choose the country &apos;s Parliament quickly .
the exit of T@@ west@@ ens is red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony will bring this dirty in@@ tri@@ ck and trying to beat the political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
low @-@ fac@@ tions CD@@ U faction team Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler would recommend to his members , El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets into the CD@@ U .
in 2013 , the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ jack@@ ets , with the personal car@@ ri@@ gs for the result of the Parliament election in 2013 .
the CD@@ U was the strongest force in front of the SPD , but the SPD and the Green had a large majority of one voice in the country .
interview for Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ rs , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discussed above negoti@@ ated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the interview for Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech and response . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect eggs from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumer friends and consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food warning n@@ ung@@ .de , the Länder have the latest information about the affected eggs batch .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even though after all we know , a health concern is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs from the offer - because the central role of recon@@ n@@ aissance German Federal Minister is not really perceived ?
food monitoring is the task of the Länder .
nevertheless , my house has been promp@@ tly closed , and since dis@@ closure of Germany has become a close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all the information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
the trade has the same as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are market@@ able and health @-@ harm@@ less .
if in eggs the rear @-@ level content of 0,00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not rush .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
these times are not the school to bl@@ ame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
according to the previous knowledge , the production plants meets no immediate debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , they must reck@@ on to suspected illegal practices of service companies with economic damages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as always there is too little Control@@ lers .
is it possible only on the staff or also on the vest@@ ed jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls , which have exposed the procedure .
however , however , food amounted to 100 percent of food and criminal energy could never be excluded .
just this is a consequ@@ ent conc@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of such events and hand@@ over to the prosecutor in the cases where criminal off@@ ences may be of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made several times , that I &apos;m expecting from the responsible authorities to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; responsible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular alarm extre@@ mis@@ m in food ru@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and market@@ able food .
if an non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de is used in the food industry , consumers and consumers are right .
manufacturer , tra@@ ders and consumers in a situation , which is absolutely necessary , are not necessary .
fundament@@ ally , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ zi@@ ds Fi@@ pro@@ il in the attitude of food delivery is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
it must be consistently alig@@ ned with high pressure on all levels .
I &apos;m expecting from all competent authorities that the atomic fact is bre@@ wing and un@@ resolved .
how the financial rules of the football to take place in N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars to Paris
the rules , which aim to prevent ir@@ rig@@ ated issues of the European soccer clubs , N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars World Record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain will not distur@@ b .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain des UEFA EURO , as the conduc@@ tive organization that monitors European game has power , teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play rules , which were launched in 2011 by the UEFA EURO , means that PS@@ G has to point out sometimes that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without large losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Braz@@ ilians from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars moving to France .
PS@@ G can easily make the money loose , so that N@@ ey@@ mar writes and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , in view of the financing of the teams through the power of the family of Qatar .
associations may apply for the acquisition of players a lot of money , but you need to control the break @-@ even point in her on the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEFA presidential election in 2007 .
the former French player believed that associations , who had their success after success , had taken tremend@@ ous debt and ris@@ ky to ru@@ in , when banks or owners moved their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P increased from concentration to the debts of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Ab@@ r@@ amo@@ vich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested vig@@ orous to build the team and build a global brand - at a har@@ der matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P distribution period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of 30 million euros .
and although platinum 2015 has fallen from the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to make sure to make exc@@ essive expend@@ itu@@ res .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will intensi@@ fy the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA EURO , compared to The Associated Press in the last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for accounting via the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year treaty agreement , so that the sum for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 launched the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( 82 million dollars ) , which later dropped to € 20 million - and it was ordered that the teams for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 was limited to 21 players , otherwise normal 25 players remain .
the UEFA is looking for clubs , trying to overcome their financial statements by companies that are linked by companies that are associated with owners of a club .
while a cat@@ ar@@ ic company could spontaneous the PS@@ G , if the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ship should not exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA EURO would not apply as a legitim@@ ate income .
just this happened in 2014 when the UEFA EURO decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ing of the PSA Tourism Authority re@@ ed .
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could rise to payments of the World Cup of 2022 in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have fought that N@@ ey@@ mar World Championship will be as ambassador for the UEFA regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA EURO will be more effective , every attempt to observe the rules .
the UEFA had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars Transfer , the people who are familiar with the situation .
they talked under the condition of the an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associated Press , since they failed to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has a turnover of CHF 54@@ 2.4 million for a profit of more than 10 million euros .
accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars is a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ship De@@ als , merch@@ an@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ k@@ ot@@ ting purchases .
the association assumes that the turnover is expected to rise by at least 30 percent after the signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated , one of the best football player to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars to prevent him that PS@@ G viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial doping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the State , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ars &apos;s local owner to PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arsenal @-@ Manager Ar@@ s@@ ene W@@ enger , whose club is owned by an American sport Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservation of La League against a state that financed an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the final Fair@@ play , because you can find different ways or different interests , if a country has a big actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new sl@@ og@@ g@@ il@@ formers
in the past few years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y @-@ chocolate has been produced for Swiss .
now the connections now stands in front of a possible end : the airline writes the job .
Swiss spokesperson by Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed on request of the news agency S@@ DA a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Northern West Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclu@@ de a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would reviewed every two to three years and subjected to a quality control .
&quot; with the current suppliers Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the spokesperson .
some 17 million small red mar@@ ches packed with up to 14 grams per year , spread the passengers in front of the landing to the passengers .
Swiss Life would not make any information about the cost .
industry in@@ ctions estimate the order volume in accordance with &quot; northern Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros @-@ daughter achieves an annual turnover of around billion Swiss francs .
but more important is all@@ em@@ al of promotional effect : for a Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ producer it is a pre@@ stige job .
as many applicants about the new tender , Swiss will not betra@@ y the Swiss .
but only Swiss manufacturers are coming into question .
according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the Treaty establishing the spring 2018 .
the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer can not be reached for the S@@ DA .
chocolate bars spread the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before the Swiss company completed a contract with the Mig@@ ros &apos;s daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut co@@ operate in collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets .
the possibility to place the logo in two and a half years ago , with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producer .
on long distance the customers of the First Class with le@@ ak@@ eries were spo@@ iled by the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli &apos;s business Class n@@ ags passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi von Lin@@ dt and in the Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .

nost@@ al@@ gic goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repet@@ ition of history is nost@@ al@@ gic because of the gl@@ a@@ ze days of the characters of the 80 @-@ er years , for the 90 @-@ year Gra@@ unge era ( as the pioneer of David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ ages the Sk@@ etch Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - this is , for 2001 , before her stars , like Elizabeth Ban@@ ks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to greater things .
as a cultural ar@@ te@@ fak@@ t it is equally a par@@ ody and a car@@ ving of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise , it feels like the time .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprising , not only because of its ab@@ sur@@ d Hum@@ ans ( it contained a original story for a good tin of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by taking them on the core of the G@@ ags , actors Middle @-@ age , are playing children who grow up - however , they still create the im@@ possibility of winning the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; Ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emotional and his par@@ ody are more according to the wat@@ ering can , among them a ri@@ ff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ er years like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The hand , cra@@ dle the cra@@ dle . &quot; ) .
at one point is a character by an Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gracious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ old ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite More@@ au ) still not forgotten .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity forever .
and there is another crazy type of mal@@ ign@@ ant plot , in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ age ) which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the tour is the best part of fran@@ chise .
it makes a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ ill@@ ons Unter@@ li@@ pp@@ ies of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like a old girl .
the moments of acci@@ dental mad@@ ness that this fran@@ chise could be achieved as a sort of repet@@ itive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches what I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ ET Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the film premi@@ ère of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; .
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon has meanwhile remin@@ is@@ cent of a different kind of nost@@ algia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even an &quot; G@@ low &quot; with his East @-@ in @-@ West Ring@@ ing I@@ con@@ ography .
the com@@ edy inspired by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka with R@@ hy@@ s Thomas as a director there is a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , a@@ the@@ ism and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main controls - a hard @-@ fleet Gregor and a ide@@ alist I@@ os@@ ef are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u U@@ lic@@ i , whose dial@@ ogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt was syn@@ ced in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some beautiful tracks for watching ( the police takes the time to watch chess on television as well as Americans do with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Open man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Chlo@@ e Sev@@ ign@@ y - provides the voice &apos; Find the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a des@@ per@@ ate prop@@ aganda target - a mur@@ derer that carries a Re@@ agan mask , is included - that it often plays like one single .
at six long episodes the com@@ edy attrac@@ ts itself , and the com@@ edy is not quick or frequently .
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , &quot; which was reduced to a lower length , could be able to visit his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re , because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef could always visit the American Embassy , which is always occupied by two thick men , who devour a bun@@ ch of ham@@ mer@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ in@@ ated communist audience is that Western culture can make all the food for a money .
the fic@@ tive Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it even with our own younger history and with the ih@@ ood .
stroke against drugs @-@ m@@ af@@ ia in the land
the police was a blow against the Italian m@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Kreis , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart were searched for numerous objects like the prosecutor &apos;s office in Constance on Friday .
in this case , 15 accus@@ ations between the ages of 25 and 77 have been arrested and issued warran@@ ts of arrest warran@@ ts .
in addition , the officials issued larger amounts of mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand Euros .
in the same raid in Italy , two persons were arrested .
on the two susp@@ ects , there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore probably extra@@ d@@ ited to Germany .
in the action , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were employed .
the members of the Mafia will be organized drug abuse , heavy violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and tor@@ tion .
the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office in the South German area has been determined since summer 2016 .
between the prosecutor in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , a real exchange and investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the big service was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
to the visor of research , Italian national members with respect to Italian Mafia .
a incident on 27 May in hat@@ ches , at the early morning several shots were fired into a restaurant , is likely to go to the bank account .
a wise man compl@@ ains major g@@ aps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens who cannot dive since . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report , the foreig@@ ner register in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that lead to partly serious failure in asylum procedures .
the representative for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , published a media report on major g@@ aps in the country @-@ centr@@ al@@ register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defic@@ ien@@ cies of the registered data could lead to asylum procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to partly gra@@ dient fault decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned in an analysis that is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; South German newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the regist@@ ers , ten million people were captured with foreign nationality , including approximately 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 education offices in Germany .
as the data have not been maintained enough , the data quality is not well @-@ kept in parts so far .
in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; from people who have long been no longer in life , or of citizens who have become German citizens , and in the register there should be no longer immer@@ se . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data samples can significantly slow down processes , &quot; says the report to further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the statistics of check @-@ out people the EU citizens consider that there would have no need to go out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such false acts led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a crushed debate on the dealing with excursions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said therefore in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently began to return refugee families with a 16 year @-@ old child back to Italy when they travelled to Italy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the passage from a internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die Neue Zu@@ er@@ back Zeitung reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the paper , it is therefore that B@@ AM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; regarding families with children - except for infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , it was no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation in the spot .
after the Dublin agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach them first .
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state may return it to the immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the grounds write the post : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the admission rate for families with minor children have been considerably increased in Italy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy voted for the recording and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EG@@ M@@ R ) observe these commit@@ ments for sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees as part of the Dublin agreement .
the internal policy spokes@@ woman in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatened because of short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system of human un@@ lawful conditions and threat of childhood . &quot;

the Bank of England becomes interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation exceeds the spec@@ ulation over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she kept interest rates on family income in the middle of a intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s political decision @-@ makers ( M@@ PC ) contributed to 0.25 % to keep interest rates on 0.25 % , with fewer members in this month , because the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for increasing growth .
in its quar@@ terly annual inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.6 % , and expected to continue at 1.6 % in 2017 , and inflation expected to rise to almost 3 % in the autumn .
but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years of interest rates would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation of Bre@@ x@@ it and said that the loan costs may be more than expected to rise to financial markets .
the members also voted for a part of the Mamm@@ alog@@ y business package that was published before a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it is necessary to provide for the financing planning for banks in order to provide financial funds for banks , although it is expected to make 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - at 115 billions of Po@@ unds Sterling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , because the pressure on the re@@ income of households will continue to consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to get to the interest rates , they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain stra@@ ins of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dimension would expect to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets currently projected the first ascent in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progres@@ sively &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to its revised growth forecasts for this and next year , the Bank forecast 1.9 % and 1,7 % compared to the forecast .
it retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and dropped by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
the decision to no change comes after the youngest dis@@ appointing growth figures have subdu@@ ed increasing expectations for a interest rate of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is slightly increased after the Bank at the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for budgets , which will be affected by increasing inflation and mar@@ gin@@ ally sal@@ aries , as the disappearance is still worse , before being better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that the monetary policy in the coming years can &apos;t be prevented &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they added that the wages increased significantly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the end of its three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to weak Po@@ unds , which will compens@@ ate one of the lower consumer expenditure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes one year after lowering the interest rates on 0.25 % in August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the coup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably be four years until this will be complete and the economy will be fully reached .
prior to the last judgment of the Bank , the call had risen to interest rates , since inflation increased its pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision makers in July , an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation dropped to 2.6 % last month in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected to put on in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it aims at its target of 2 % &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Co@@ rec@@ o mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent return of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , as the credit card would be looking forward to stores and want to finish the year in positive ways .
the market looks very good for those who close the existing De@@ als and the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with extra @-@ free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) should c@@ ate the controversi@@ al HIV drug 10.000 people
from September after a fight against financing of the drug in N@@ HS , patients will receive access to a &quot; trans@@ forming &quot; HIV preval@@ ent treatment .
N@@ HS England announced that there could reduce the risk of infection risk by around 86 percent before the sexual intercourse , which is currently supplied by the health service over a first three @-@ year study for an estimated 10,000 people .
he declared to finance the process , after the Court of Appeals in the last year of the Supreme Court of Justice had confirmed that the N@@ HS had to pay attention to the Declaration that local authorities should finance him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was welcomed by N@@ HS England @-@ CEO Simon Stev@@ ens , during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health activities in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first ones who will enable the application of people , and other clinics will follow in October 2018 before it will be introduced in England in April 2018 .
pre@@ fix sp@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xes ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV samples which are taken before sex to reduce the risk of a HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP reduces HIV transmission to an infection risk .
p@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or just two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to those who come into question for the treatment , gay ones or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners were not treated successfully . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinics , suitable participants are identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner , whose HIV status is not known as known by anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a dent@@ ist , can also register for a possible participation in their local sexual clinical trials .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicine in this week after an international competitive proc@@ urement .
the study aims to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by clinical analysis , such as in large scale , implemented and implemented in a large scale .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should be the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevention of HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in forests of one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted to needy and endangered people , the possibility to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September to people with high HIV risk , people will have access to this N@@ HS financed attempt to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and not having a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many lives .
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be carried out in all the country and nobody said that there is no risk for HIV .
now , since the P@@ EP test medicine was abolished , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
Sharon Ho@@ dg@@ son , sh@@ adows @-@ health , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome to months delay and hes@@ it@@ ating implementation due to the government .
the evidence shows how to trans@@ form this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this try brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is to be carried out as soon as possible in the country to protect people who are HIV infected , and that they are infected with HIV in the society that we get a step closer to the preval@@ ence of HIV in society .
the big life live : mezzanine and intelligent designer tricks have changed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed in 2014 from a large house at Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed her bags and sold .
&quot; before , I lived with my Ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a lot of larger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I searched for something that was similar to my price .
I was shown in Ear@@ ls Court in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have made me in love and made a quote on this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led since the first visit .
originally a one @-@ room property with a w@@ asted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted to have high ceilings , large windows , a lot of light .
this was my requirement , &quot; says it .
for this purpose she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill to create the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home , not just a development , but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms to place each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine , where you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to be creative , to solve the stip@@ ulation .
&quot; the steel structure is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they had been stacked together without having to g@@ aps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it wasn &apos;t only therefore to build a simple platform but to put the steel that it had the right height or below the right height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan , two rooms in full height over@@ place each other - with plenty of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper engraving window of Retro@@ u@@ vi@@ us down the gl@@ am@@ ous living room .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends , a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ ro@@ red , to leave it longer .
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ oring feel like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units offer space for all bri@@ dging and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
due to perception of a gl@@ am@@ our@@ al space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
mer@@ g@@ able kitchens are nothing new .
special about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little of engineering went there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , fur@@ ious MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s most important that if you move the door , it is very easy to gli@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne additional 16 m ² could win an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the basic space - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form a real estate agents will perform and a comp@@ utation based on the floor size will be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they made it to enlarge the floor space and to use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things you want to touch and therefore help to create an emotional binary in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electrical sockets in the walls .
these are important but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;

brothers fight for a real estate transaction of 500 million US dollars
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family established the dy@@ nast@@ y , in a debate about one of the largest real estate imper@@ atives Vic@@ tor@@ ias worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developers Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy it as their property and their property is to be split .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp con@@ front@@ ation over the separation is held in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have 38 real estate , valued at more than half a billion dollars , since 1973 the family purchased a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood , since 1973 .
there was the West@@ co je@@ ans family and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now encomp@@ asses offices in the city centre , the development area of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the subur@@ b .
after an agreement with their de@@ ceased father , Colin - von Paul has described as the main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the family De Lut@@ is - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul is about one @-@ third .
a court file states that Colin is owned worth 316 million dollars and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has shown himself to Paul as a pro@@ bl@@ ender point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Colin proposed ess@@ ay have left him with the left what I kept for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in the first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place on Friday .
the brothers also strug@@ gling to control over the existing business - what Colin , how Paul claims to have been excluded .
Colin argu@@ ed , this is not true , but th@@ rows it to managing some owners .
in an early affiliate that was filed by Colin , he says he hop@@ ed to make dispute .
&quot; my Italian heir writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held a law firm .
Ms. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who operated milk bars and delic@@ acy stores in the late 1950 &apos;s and in the early 1970s , shop bought a shop in Brun@@ swi@@ ck .
it used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in Colin the first Je@@ ans@@ ing of the family .
Colin says that he began in West@@ co , when he was in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she died and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to pass their possession to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi said often to me that he would never have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brothers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ is group of companies whose Colin claims that Mark had paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark , Paul says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the terms of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin has recovered himself very well , although it was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography of Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of television stars in 2015 .
Fair@@ fax Media received Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and whose attor@@ neys touch contact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Colin answered with the SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can really say a lot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me and to our family names by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tries to fulfil the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have believed that Paul and I said in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope he hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday it seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Colin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ umps &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can really do it .
if yes , he will be the first .
POL@@ IC@@ ICO reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restri@@ ct the Information flow on President Tr@@ ump - including the news of news - in hope to keep the b@@ oss on a smooth course .
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , at his first working day with leading employees , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House which he would like : bad information that come into the hands of the President .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly told the staff that information should run through him - whether on paper or in post@@ ings - because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wa@@ iter &apos;s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring its media firm .
President Tr@@ umps &apos;s relation to TV reaches decades - and now , where he is at the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; when Tr@@ ump was cancelled due to un@@ fair reporting period , it was productive to show him that he was able to convince a f@@ aire reporting of positions , &quot; said the former election campaign against Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against POL@@ IC@@ ICO .
in fact , Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ umps &apos;s Twitter hab@@ it under control , according to six former election campaign officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . &quot;
okay . okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ umps &apos;s Twitter hab@@ it ever was &quot; under control , &quot; is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
perhaps these campaigns could not know what we don &apos;t know - that Tr@@ umps T@@ we@@ ets have not included its inter@@ ventions even more ignition .
we will probably know something about the we@@ ar@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his staff has already made it several times , trouble shooting from him , then their effort was worthwhile .
but no one can prevent it rig@@ or@@ ously that Tr@@ ump Kon@@ tro@@ ut calls them .
a part of the problem exists , that people in a white house , composed of competing parties , trying to present their own agenda by combining Tr@@ ump Material , which may improve their views from the world .
POL@@ IC@@ ICO -@@ quite busy with this history - reported in May about pre@@ ference for consultants , president of strategic reasons .
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react on negative press clips , especially such with damaged Lec@@ ks , and that he can find out to find out this from whence they come .
exactly that happened at the end of February , when someone signed a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Pro@@ v@@ ok@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a bun@@ ch to be at the White House .
although Johnson was banned from Twitter for lack of violence , or that he has no concrete evidence , or that he expressed false occurr@@ ences in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke them .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tries to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ ously self , and his adviser are still in effect .
these un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
chis@@ eled bur@@ gl@@ ers get Post of Europ@@ ol
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the address is unknown , the compensation of the population is growing and shipped . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in all Europe are shipped in this summer ( virtual ) postcards on dangerous crimin@@ als .
since the addresses of the requested sever@@ ity bur@@ gl@@ ers are not known , indications from the population will be shipped and asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europ@@ ol reported on Friday of the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar of winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences have shown that many wing@@ ed tourist information is stuck , called it on Europ@@ ol .
you have compiled 21 postcards to selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed .
36 of the online visions have been arrested , at least eleven of them due to the release of the website .
travelers negoti@@ ate over a tr@@ ench and return to the &apos; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s series &apos;
some of the we@@ al@@ thi@@ est home owners of West Mid@@ lands are back with some ent@@ ail travelers on the foot of war , which have been negoti@@ ated by the municipality to demand a field before their mansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside of a we@@ al@@ thy street of Soli@@ h@@ ull which is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and a army of transports , after they were challenged only in May , without being slaughtered by one of the counsel , to prevent her inci@@ dents .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defense units and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted in order to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the inhabit@@ ant inhabitants have the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useful to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous residents said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went on Monday evening after they were handed down from Bentley Heath , where they have thrown stones on the passport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Council needs to be forced by Sch@@ am to the implementation in fact , since it was us@@ eless in dealing with the problem .
the travelers were moved in May , and are now back again .
more yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to convert long ways to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I live at Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my people , if the Council can stop it once . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a roommate wanted to be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , we just have seen the last round of this trip to become lo@@ oted by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and one has even seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a speaker of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised bearing along the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to continue so quickly as possible .
to support our satisfaction collection , it is very important that as possible as many local residents use anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the dish must check , when we advance our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts is currently renovated and is scheduled to be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the hotel Birken@@ hof with the then amb@@ ience of operating company mbH to the 13th of April 2014 , some 30 000 nights were lost per year , and also revenues through the tourist tax .
in autumn 2014 , in view of dramatic rising figures of refugees , which came into the County , the hotel building is offered as a collective accommodation , which used for controversi@@ al discussion .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time .
but Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts , Mayor of Julian Oss@@ wald , def@@ ended the hotel site and said already at the time of serious people interested in the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with office in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern purchased the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star plus category in the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ ier object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the former Hotel Birken@@ hof has already been available since a longer time of bau@@ utt@@ container in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it will be clear what extensive renovation works will be made .
the floors were torn out , ceilings to partially dismant@@ led , old bath@@ tub@@ s from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do so until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with large covered showers , the entrance area will be re@@ designed , new window will be installed .
everything was later &quot; beautiful bourgeois @-@ close , &quot; how Thomas Sch@@ erer ex@@ presses her .
&quot; we want to make a jewelry cord . &quot;
the swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
we don &apos;t want to be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but is already emphas@@ ized on a higher city level .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms would be wide and spread much .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people are to feel comfortable in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian Oss@@ wald and Tourism director Michael K@@ rau@@ se have already conducted so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are right together with those of the Hotel Group .
&quot; we are at the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investment required , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants not to prove exactly .
scar@@ c@@ ely under a million euro , he calcul@@ ates .
the external facilities are also placed on the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace , which is publicly accessible from the restaurant , publicly accessible .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : us Young Ad@@ dition@@ ally , Grand Jury
in the Ukraine aff@@ air to US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Sonder@@ er@@ ical Robert Mu@@ eller is supposed to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee recorded the work during the past few weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote on appeal with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
the broad@@ caster CNN reported that it is already the first charges in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ umps &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. secret services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin since longer , targeted in the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there were differences between Tr@@ umps Ac@@ tor campaigns and Moscow .
in the case of investigations , several men are supposed to stand as a consultant of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also increased more and more tr@@ umps private and business environment under the magni@@ fying glass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special j@@ umping Tr@@ ump personally arranged in the center and seek the alleg@@ ations whether the President may have handic@@ apped the judi@@ ci@@ ary of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine and decide to decide whether it is to be charged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys will therefore also be called the cl@@ amps .
mostly , they are switched on if there are greater and controversi@@ al cases .
the process takes place always behind the closed doors .
the board can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to order individuals under the oath .
according to the CNN , pre @-@ charges were issued , which are turning to the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and an Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were promp@@ ted to a statement , called it in the report .
Moreover , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. there were also Tr@@ umps consultant and son J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his dam@@ aging campaign against Paul Man@@ a@@ fort in conversation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right @-@ wing per@@ formers said on the Thursday night in the US TV show that Mu@@ eller don &apos;t make sure that Mu@@ eller does not leave his work , and that he should be necessary to act quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it must not be inev@@ it@@ ably called that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the collection of an indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the creation of the committee on the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason to concern the concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President of the Thursday evening submitted a speech in West Virginia to present the Russian aff@@ air as campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russia story is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the subject give the Democrats a way to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good because they can speak nothing but they can speak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in a statement that he is ignor@@ ant of a Grand Jury .
but they also usually work in secret , stressed .
the White House fears any measures that accelerated the work of the special appeal on &quot; f@@ aire &quot; way .
the former FBI CEO James Com@@ ey said three times , that it will not be determined against the President .
we have no reason to accept that something has changed anything , it was told in the Declaration .
but Mu@@ eller was only used when Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this ring the accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump became a loud voice , he &apos;d like to use the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him an investigation of the investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the President stands for the examination under a large pressure .
after presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special medi@@ ator and its employees .
that solved spec@@ ulations about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller would be released .
unlike an independent special issu@@ er of the Congress like in the watch@@ erg@@ ate aff@@ aires , to the later President Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller has found a position in which he could be frozen due to the President of the Department of Justice .
several tran@@ s of both parties are subject to such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Must@@ ators were issued on Thursday , after which the special issu@@ ers could not be released just as easy .
Ant@@ arc@@ tic : gig@@ antic Eis@@ berg drives in the Ant@@ arc@@ tica
in the Western Ant@@ arc@@ tica , a gig@@ antic ice@@ berg from the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin is solved by the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
it shared the cer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred W@@ egener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the over a B@@ illion tons heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometer large Kol@@ oss return to the north and will probably need two , three years , until he had melted .
it has a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest ice@@ berg , researchers have registered in the past three decades .
there is no risk for people from him .
to what extent of climate change played a role in the crash of the ice@@ berg , after research data is un@@ clear .
a total of 30 years , however , there is a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s of ice cream in the region , writes the U.S. research centre for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a factor background .
according to many researchers , this could be associated with global warming .
the Kol@@ oss was broken up so far as part of Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is floating on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it continues to grow to the sea and regularly breaks off .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the cant@@ tic Peninsula .
North of this Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ ises was the balance of wax and break some years ago .
a complete shot will be torn apart , writes A@@ WI @-@ Resear@@ cher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
it is thought that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as far .
furthermore , the ice @-@ plate is under stress and can be broken down if there is a piece of a key .
the melt of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg increases the level , because they swim on the water and ice as much water as it emerg@@ es after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the swal@@ lows will result that the gl@@ ac@@ iers will run directly into the sea and much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the level , but only in a low degree , the British research project for observation of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is the fourth biggest Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is of Ant@@ arc@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
the passage from the mainland is up to 700 m thick , on the front edge to the open ocean is approx . 200 meters .
there is regularly breaks .
&quot; although it is a natural man and has no direct link to climate change , the ice sign is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; this is the far withdrawal from the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed .
among scientists , it is controversi@@ al whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is will go back again and possibly go together , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if this researchers have won the crash of this gig@@ antic ice@@ berg to combat climate change , so in the past few decades , many ice@@ bergs of the ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have fallen .
this long Z@@ ip@@ ur of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic extends towards South America .
according to data of the British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the decline was contributed to the decline .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has been in the past 50 years around three degrees and t@@ amed up to the areas where the temperature is fastest .
CD@@ U wants pet food at personnel
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is always difficult to occup@@ y free @-@ to @-@ point jobs , the CD@@ U calls out of the employer of the employer to become more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just shortly before the summer break , the Kre@@ ist@@ ag did 41 new jobs in administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and officials work for the Kreis@@ Administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 apprentices have their first working day behind .
the teaching points at the circle are obviously very cov@@ eted .
around 620 applicants were recorded for participants in this year .
nevertheless , the circle continues to come further staff to cope with the increased requirements and tasks .
at the moment , there are no occupied places in the district M@@ ett@@ mann as before 50 .
we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general management .
the CD@@ U would now want to take the initiative in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and compete with the sp@@ ill Short@@ ages in the administration .
according to the wishes of the parties &quot; a concept for personnel development and personnel development work . &quot;
the aim is to un@@ cover not only short @-@ term Bed@@ ar@@ fe to Speci@@ alists , but future @-@ oriented to the applicants , is called it .
the overall concept should be oriented toward the inside and outside , specific measures for trans@@ verse beginners and include a training offensive , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this has been listening to a good approach .
because the circle has done it to do with staff problems , which one knew earlier this way .
other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a regular &quot; competition &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees to put disease or age @-@ conditioned from the service .
to make the highest time in action , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
however , Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , president of the CD@@ U , is still going beyond the joint request with his party .
he was very long before already in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a f@@ aust@@ le surprise , when he pos@@ ed the personnel of personnel in question , and the other parties did bl@@ oss@@ om .
peoples would like that all the possibilities will be checked , which allow a outlet from the municipal employers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a pet food &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is trying to pay the CD@@ U , employees and officials to pay better than the collective capital for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently mandatory , increases or more money , if one changes in a higher level , which is oriented to professional years .
but the tasks of the circle are increasingly grown in the past years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms were to be set up in which employees will take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute protection law .
not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ au director Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy intensi@@ fies the sound to NGO @-@ Mig@@ rants rescue @-@ rescue
Italy has warned NGOs working on mig@@ rant boats in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they do not continue to keep new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs write no new Code of Con@@ duct , it is difficult to see how to work on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Min@@ nit@@ i in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ nit@@ is warning came a day after the Italian authorities of the German relief organization &apos; youth Ret@@ tet &apos; conf@@ is@@ cated because their team had worked effectively with human traff@@ ic@@ kers in a way that facilit@@ ated the illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which only has been in operation since one year , refused to express his detailed information of the Italian government an@@ wal@@ ts Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of human life is our top priority . so we felt very sorry that we can not operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a position on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge any alleg@@ ations that are currently collected , after we have collected all the information and evaluate the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that his occupation of infl@@ atable mig@@ rant migrants will be delivered to them directly from human traff@@ ic@@ kers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can drive them again , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such re@@ union took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the acquisition of the Prosecutor , the contents of Italian media has been published .
the crew will be suspected of implementing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the lif@@ egu@@ ards in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ ves to take away .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats must be on board such as I@@ u@@ vent@@ a mainly a Italian police officer who monitored their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs , which are involved in search and rescue operations , have now been prepared to keep the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as un@@ necessarily , but un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential amendments or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their lif@@ ying actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refused to sign the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organisation , Doc@@ tors @-@ Organisation Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
meanwhile , Min@@ nit@@ i said that the number of migrants who arrived after the emergency measures in Italy came down in recent weeks to strengthen the efforts of Libyan Coast Guard and the cooperation with the local bourgeoisie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali to reduce the number of migrants who left those countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer B@@ iker , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the Nord@@ p@@ fal@@ z in order to enjoy four days long Tri@@ als and S@@ ights .
there were three friendly guides available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for touring .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome reception .
the first tour led by hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed observation points , partly on towers , of which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream levels .
in the year there were again longer asc@@ ents , for the long Tri@@ als .
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
again , the look@@ out point out to the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ or@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .

console instead of lawn - Bundesliga equipment for e @-@ sport
sit the Sport @-@ Stars in the future before computer consoles , instead of turning by wind and weather to fight against st@@ adi@@ es ?
fact is : E @-@ Sports has long since become an increasing industry to a lu@@ k@@ ative business - great stars , millions fans and huge tournaments with high tracks .
this also recognized the first federal states that are increasingly involved in this area .
at the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last@@ ly the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , which formed an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July , and two professionals created for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; we hope to insp@@ ire the whole new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says the Board of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure that some associations rise on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup took place in London the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; which gam@@ ers compete against each other in the Gam@@ er of various clubs .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also provides great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has meanwhile been an agency for virtual football player .
&quot; the real football must inter@@ act in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people go into the stadium , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer the Asian .
with well @-@ known E @-@ Sport@@ s@@ men under contract you could be able to be present online by more often more often than once per year , when only once per year to Asia .
what is it exactly ?
in the E @-@ Sport are computer games like &quot; League Of Legends &quot; , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the football simulation FIFA at competitive level .
as long as in normal sports , li@@ ce have long established , in which the professionals are involved in each other .
and from Asia to 2022 , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it just a correct sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly confident .
Ingo F@@ rob@@ otic has also been dealt with a question with the question .
for the Professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competent and many biological and physical reactions , which can also find in classic sport , for example increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also need cogn@@ itive capabilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise along the console but also exercise their body and respect the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ rob@@ otic but also problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ oping is always a theme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
checks are difficult when online games are difficult , and in the scene was missing the structures of classical Sports .
the scientists emphas@@ ises the high integral effect of the E @-@ Sports .
the players are internationally active , that &apos;s like a big global family , there is no intercultural obstacles .
a study by the consulting firm Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the E @-@ Sport predic@@ ts a fast growth .
in 2016 , we have been invested 50 million euros in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments .
in three years , sales will be 130 million .
for the close to 2.4 billion Euro of the soccer Bundesliga , this is little .
however , the E @-@ sport &quot; is not far away from the established sports like hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte Consultant .
International are many countries already .
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ Bas@@ ket@@ ball@@ player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez takes part in the US team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher invests in the e@@ Sport @-@ competition Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is also a lot in Europe .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ sport was introduced as a class@@ room , F@@ rob@@ otic says .
in the Netherlands and France , the football club in the Netherlands , according to D@@ utt , is now required to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany dropped behind , declared V@@ f@@ B Management Board R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
only in nost@@ algia , and to clari@@ fy the old times , is enough anymore enough .
this is the reason to keep the tradition of the association , but the company set up the modern market at the same time .
&quot; we live in a digit@@ ised world , &quot; means that D@@ utt also writes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then you cannot hold fast that everything remains so in football , as always there was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter , because of the texts that Conrad Roy , sentenced to suicide , sentenced Conrad Roy
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their convic@@ tion behind G@@ ently and five years were exposed to currency .
Carter was convicted in June because of a neg@@ ligent murder of Conrad Roy , who participated in the life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ certain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until appeal .
she was con@@ fron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives was argu@@ ed that both she suffered from psychological illness .
in red tro@@ users and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and after down@@ wards eyes when they was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they brought about Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said the lawyer in judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life in order to make her own better .
she has no responsibility &quot; , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he was a lawyer &apos;s lawyer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; horri@@ fying circum@@ stance that she deeply regre@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not found that her &quot; age or ri@@ pen@@ ess or even her spiritual disease have a significant effect on their actions . &quot;
a state prosecutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day , in whom I don &apos;t make the loss of my dear Son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to be proud of me , and as I go with all my sor@@ rows , which we will bear for etern@@ ity with us , for his sisters there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that they will be persecuted by the knowledge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that she will never take part in the wedding of her brother or would be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more these only person to have with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain which I kept for the rest of my life always with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case seems to be a just@@ i@@ fiable cause , since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to call another , suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was dead in 2014 from a carbon mon@@ oxide po@@ is@@ oning in one vehicle .
the case moved national attention to itself after Car@@ ters text letters revealed that they encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hands on , spring out of a building , see yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages which she had sent in two weeks before his death , while he was with his family in vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the sight of his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing that you must do is to switch the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told that Carter sought the attention through the death of Roy and ordered that they should take advantage of some of the press .
the case has the legal opinion .
for the few , Carter informed the Carter , Am@@ anda Knox , who was convicted of murder in Italy for murder , was acquitted before two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; woman Knox , 30 years old , published in Los Angeles Times , published a comment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter deser@@ ves compassion on compassion and help , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ i : learn from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of the FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run at the Audi Cup at the Audi Cup , is not a co@@ incidence .
FC Bayern is the winner of the Con@@ vey@@ or Cup @-@ winner a big season with an extra @-@ motivation .
anything else was in the cabin in the cabin , I saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ i immediately , even if the additional garment piece was very small , very small .
but as far as far as far as wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , there is no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel New to see it , he made the constitu@@ ent binary in the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ dition Cup winner , after his first use as Bavaria captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the one could run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of Coach could also be so troubled .
not the eight years older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was chosen as a player leader in youth toys , de@@ but@@ ants , and just from vacation , but he has chosen as a player leader .
sugar spread much to those who want to stay much , that you want to keep in mood .
so he who has chosen the inheritance of Lah@@ m , an additional extra motivation can only use well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ imm@@ ich confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want to take as a player : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
on the right side , this is now its position , the white Bin@@ d on the arm did their rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ i worked in this start@@ up information such as the one that can take the ru@@ d@@ der in your hand .
he gave instructions to direct the tro@@ op tro@@ upe .
he had a look for all , while many others were busy with themselves .
Vid@@ al therefore to play its missing fitness ( foldable ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches therefore to link the devil &apos;s performance ( fol@@ ds only conditi@@ onally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus took not negative at their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Trieste .
all that worked out quite good .
Sü@@ le ran next to K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y in front of the def@@ ences , both ag@@ ated so@@ vereign .
the well @-@ known Napol@@ i storm is often heavily damaged , moreover , Sü@@ le also tried to successful a couple of time in the game building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y had to say that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we were hop@@ ing for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a regular performance at their debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ location , tem@@ po@@ s : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also picked up for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as un@@ usual , this Bayern world still is for the real@@ y length , one looked into the game to the game .
Rud@@ y for example gave birth to the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but for six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ ich passed itself after a few kn@@ itting statements in the back of his new players .
there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; what happens here , I now noticed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you just need to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all this he has to do no more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

company satisfied with Rhineland @-@ p@@ fäl@@ ische minister : economy lo@@ ves W@@ iss@@ ings Tempo
it is often un@@ pleasant , the relationship between the country and regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Grün@@ e ) still was Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this is reflected by more than one year , in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and t@@ amp@@ er at the same time the old woman .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trieste ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Know the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has been blo@@ cked . &quot;
the largest K@@ ehr@@ t@@ wende sees Nat@@ us into the infrastructure policy : the bridge between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands in the preferred list of the country now .
this year , the Ministry is entitled to a planning procedure , until 2021 , the building is scheduled .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West in Trier , which stands on the schedule of the federal government plans .
the aim is to take the route in December 2020 , says secretary of Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier aims at the wine of the Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate label , in order to increase sales volumes in supermarkets and halt the trend of German Wine exports for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ dom has an open ear to people who want to establish a dedicated company , the Chamber of Commerce .
in the new Master Bonus , Trier will see an additional inc@@ enti@@ ve for young apprentices , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
the award is provided by a premium of 1000 Euro for the counter@@ part champion examination and 2500 euros , if the graduates have become self @-@ employed within ten years of training .
the house tasks @-@ list for the country remains long .
when the planned street construction are quickly facts to create , at the same time , there is the country on the necessary staff , Jan Glock@@ auer , chief executive director of the Chamber of Commerce Trier .
of 56 new engineers , the Wis@@ dom wants to adjust mobility in the state of mobility , are now only 29 places occupied .
the I@@ HK calls for more orders to external offices .
CD@@ U faction vi@@ ze Christian Bald@@ auf extension refers to calculations of the Court of Audit@@ ors , the country invested more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of state roads as proposed .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects another concept of the country , as it wants to fix the sp@@ ill Short@@ ages in the region .
seri@@ ousness is also the old broad@@ band manufacturer in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had been rated the power supply in a I@@ HK survey only with the score 3.4 .

ex @-@ Economic Minister Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting at the Supervisory Board of the wind farm Pro Wind .
the green group of Lem@@ ke left Lem@@ ke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where they had already dre@@ amed the field after four months .
Audi should change over 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - by car manufacturer to face a counter @-@ reaction
a day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would be able to update the software to more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW chairman said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more intelligent options are available &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so that BMW is based on European cities - including Munich , where BMW is resident - or restri@@ ct diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the companies as a recall .
European automobile manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ itting the diesel engines are considered car@@ cin@@ ogenic , and can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of autom@@ aker to install systems to neutr@@ alize the exhaust gases of diesel vehicles , also take up what it makes difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged to ig@@ no@@ red the mighty car companies and to ign@@ ore the problem of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mist@@ akes of Volkswagen , which could regul@@ ate the use of so @-@ called down @-@ off devices to comply with regulations when a car was tested , but for normal handling conditions .
in the United States , several employees of Volkswagen were charged , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected before delivery and could be submitted to the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German crime investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities decided to have a system installed in order to handle the emission regulations in Europe , and an inquiry which focused on the United States was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could win Volkswagen heavily : the luxury car manufacturer carries out disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately to profit by Volkswagen .

Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ dil@@ lo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as artist , he struck himself as a character set for happiness cards by - what he showed him fru@@ str@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ iest day in my professional life was the day when lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said once . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris came to the end of the 60 &apos;s breakthrough , with the publication of his Cart@@ o@@ ons in Paris match &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ dil@@ lo found many fans .

the script is not written by him .
this is why he is more on the TV Series , which is produced as its original drawings , wor@@ d@@ less .
lav@@ ender threatened by climate change
he became a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the Lav@@ en@@ del is remin@@ ded due to the d@@ rought of the d@@ rought and due to diseases @-@ defined insec@@ ts , which researchers and farmers , trying to find solutions , large head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ en@@ del in Provence has been effective , because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change , which has caused much less rain in the spring last years , and much more in the autumn .
this has imp@@ lications for the lif@@ esp@@ an of Lav@@ en@@ del .
there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the Zwer@@ g@@ zi@@ k@@ ades , and with very dry weather , there is very many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
lav@@ ender oil is not only waiting for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also required for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
to the solutions that are considered to be considered a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the ins@@ ulating the plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dry conditions .

but on that day , in the shade of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their routine .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what is reliable : they shall take their children with the office , which were the goal of a attack with gren@@ ades in 2009 .
safety experts have written three words at a panel on the front side of the room : opponent , neutral , allies .
you ask the repor@@ ter , name for each column - no proof is necessary , perception and ab@@ dom@@ inal feel .
there are drug ad@@ diction , politicians , business@@ men , journalists , journalists who are suspected of being suspected of for@@ cing the Government or the map , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico as dangerous .
there is no ru@@ d@@ ling of violence , and throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are frequent , are increasingly more journalists : at least 25 years since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto as President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , until now , there were at least seven killed in seven states this year .
among the latter , their publ@@ ishers and their inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live and journalist in Mexico , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs .
his lack becomes deep , although his presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ barra and Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez , bear t @-@ shirts to show his ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous face with glasses or typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ter discuss their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , Par@@ ano@@ ia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although 2010 has been a special appeal on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Office of journalists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to edit the cases of journalists , according to the Committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the majority of those who are associated with drug traff@@ icking and organis@@ ing crimes , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are only rarely honoured before judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the odo@@ ce , they still consist on to handle the violence of Sin@@ al@@ oa , although they are un@@ comfortable , even though the terrain is now tra@@ cked .
without information about the mur@@ derer , without righteousness , the meeting on the discussion of safety , says I@@ barra .
&quot; it is very stup@@ id to turn my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why we don &apos;t mis@@ use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men , and was shot on him for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - the with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twelve river &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leg drove away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left one woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors of rum@@ ors to fly free in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing as silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest in last year and the extradition of the United States in January , Sin@@ al@@ oa had become one of the most bloody batt@@ les@@ ions of the country , since riv@@ al@@ izing fra@@ ctions struggle here to fill the vacuum .
it &apos;s nothing to be shot in Sin@@ al@@ oa every day someone or several people on the road , or that the cemetery is full of ench@@ anted , two @-@ story m@@ ol@@ een for drug ch@@ efs who are bigger than many houses for the Living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a minute , there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peace &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only one cart@@ el has a control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the fault that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understanding have contributed to the murder .
first , in February , the publication of a interviews with Dam@@ o L@@ op@@ ez , a leader of the riv@@ alled cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s sons .
this publication may be off@@ ended , ass@@ essing gear members bought each copy of the output as soon as they had been delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second error was to force in the name of Val@@ dez , after the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper , which had the same story , to leave the country to his own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long survived that his friends and colleagues did so that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ al@@ oa , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism , without taking the sm@@ ash po@@ ison problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
at the time the newspaper served a call for the cour@@ ageous and hon@@ est reporting , and sales and advertising took part .
rep@@ orter loved it , hard @-@ lo@@ oming investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the reader were fascin@@ ated by a publication in which they could read stories , that nobody could not cover anything else .
&quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for their reporting in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists in the persecution of Mexican drug history , where also it led them .
he gave himself up that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ al@@ oa is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV in October last October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take the task to take you as a journalist - either the or you play the Dum@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would not want to be asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What did you do because of many still@@ born ... why did you not say what went before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team measures Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could fly like a do@@ ck@@ workers , a friend , gener@@ ously with h@@ ugs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ama , the bar towards the office , go there on the same table there .
well ask her : was his love for routine use ?
his death has also forced them to ask their own approach in question , how to do their work on the best and live in life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t like to move with their women , their children , their clean shops , her home starting and run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cen@@ sored and self @-@ ster@@ ilization .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell of a sense that can be mo@@ cked ... and then the thing with Javier happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are not in Sin@@ al@@ oa no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ k@@ rati@@ ves , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly there were no cell@@ phones allowed . days previously announced that Spyware ans is selling exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside the two polic@@ emen protection sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a middle class district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the Scher@@ z , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether these officers are among the 50 percent of polic@@ emen who described themselves as a tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it is months ago , since the repor@@ ter went into the mountain landscape , where the drug con@@ founded de fac@@ to under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has spent three main stories .
there was the assassination of the former Box@@ er Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ al@@ oa on the assassination of the former Box@@ er Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez .
they also had a pos@@ é to the state spending , concentrated on the home town of the Govern@@ ors .
and there was a group that carried out in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping section .
there was no official word about it , who was kidn@@ apped , or as it happened , so it was careful when it was time to write , what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug traff@@ ic@@ kers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a polit@@ ician , who belonged to the Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( pr@@ i ) , which ruled the whole century all political levels .
recently , several pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ loss cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real bat the repor@@ ter , to write about previous inci@@ dents in this locality , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; was a military attack .
only a few months earlier , the readers have seen the colum@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the ab@@ duction .
&quot; previously , we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickn@@ ame &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slim body nature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the Val@@ dez office was dedicated to storage space for signs and st@@ ic@@ kers , dedicated to the murder of journalists , because the staff has become something that they would never expect : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ ap up a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning for a demonstration because of a further journalist to the office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the Western State of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; throughout the country , journalists had become stronger , by organizing themselves in organized protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on obe@@ dience and building projects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez away in Washington and is trying to collect international support for justice in the Val@@ dez case .
during a meeting with Governor of Sin@@ al@@ oa on the day following the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to pi@@ anos and destroy journalists , because they have said the truth .
it has since then asked that she is again divided by the government because it is wor@@ ried that their rage has viol@@ ated their objec@@ tivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico of organiz@@ ational crimes involving government officials and a valid society &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his final book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters could not only be killed by drug traff@@ icking , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces , which were with organized crime under a blan@@ ket .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die , because they would like to hold the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the Mor@@ de obviously have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one forget the death of the blo@@ g@@ writer Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that allegedly signed from Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones next to its separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of Cor@@ ro@@ sl@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue on how it did El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of its Director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z moved publicly to the drug board with a report on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists from their home countries or even fled from the country .
it &apos;s a pain@@ ful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and are looking for dangers .
and sometimes they are told , as it appears in the photographer of Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa , which was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue back and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ barra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , gives to that the drug traff@@ ick@@ ed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to Hell , and therefore I became repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition was already ended , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the brush in front of the office and drank beer , than once all of their phones began .
a number of shooting villages with band@@ ry riv@@ als and security forces near the bathing place Maz@@ at@@ lan had left the dead 19 .
the war ended , as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the Bord@@ stone can@@ te you have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ ren he@@ ul@@ ators near to - a further shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look to the polic@@ emen who stopped the guard to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they were not afraid , they did not show it .
under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for quite Sin@@ al@@ oa , the staff was followed by Ri@@ odo@@ ce its traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just remember , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If on the same day when Javier was murdered , the practitioners was murdered in me , she asked for reporting on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to strip its enemies
at first glance , it looks like a statue , although an out@@ stretched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have found that the first findings of incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian min@@ ers have been so well maintained that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ osau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so good that they could even determine that his lo@@ pp@@ le skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had something of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ quiet past &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; awarded him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surviving din@@ osau@@ rs , which ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered kind of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the chal@@ k between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly good rest@@ rained condition has researchers , who described it as &quot; really remarkable , &quot; bl@@ oss@@ om
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the tra@@ pped plant car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he died on March 21 , 2011 at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada .
he met on something that seemed to see from the surrounding cliffs . it seemed to see more precisely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of severe natural earth .
after all these hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you &apos;re just a little with the eyes , you might believe that it was sleeping , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is shown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter into the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs specimens - Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this plant car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res , although it is covered with a arm@@ or , and a walk @-@ in shell , probably resem@@ bles the flesh of the ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily damaged Din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide themselves in front of prey , and used a sh@@ iel@@ ding technology that is used as counter@@ f@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals .
this could have been allowed to soak in its surroundings and to soak its enemies , experts what indicates that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old cre@@ ature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs made the head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild beast and it &apos;s Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell called , one of a team that has spent more than 7.000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen allowed it enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the patterns and the form of sheds and arm@@ or on its body .
they discovered the con@@ sh@@ aded , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the con@@ federation is common , the results are surprising because the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta exceeds the living animals by far the living animals .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs of sufficient pressure by the flesh and send din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution had f@@ avo@@ red the disappearance of the con@@ front@@ ation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals , which use the con@@ gest@@ ation - think of them , zeb@@ ras or sh@@ ing@@ le animals - are much smaller and viol@@ ate as a prey , which was sign@@ alized that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier exposed to a real struggle for survival .
&quot; strong space @-@ tier behaviour on a massive , severely damaged Din@@ osau@@ rs , how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs noise of the chal@@ k have to have been , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was red brown .
scientists still examine the animal to regard to his life , including its controversi@@ al p@@ its , to figure out what it has eaten as its last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , went into a river and went out into the sea , where he sank to the sea .
at that time , Alberta were as warm as South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably widespread more inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because he is completely covered with con@@ dens@@ ate skin , but also in three dimensions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the result is that the animal today looks almost , like in the early 1960s .
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to design it . if you &apos;re just a little with the eyes , you might believe almost believe that he is sleeping at bed@@ time . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge thermal em@@ itting di@@ odes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , which were on two legs , crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex lived , millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the pan@@ de@@ te Din@@ osau@@ rs became known from some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 @-@ foot ( 11,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster .
the scientists , their latest findings in the journal @-@ Biology appear , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta should be sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ ified in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he died on March 21 , 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada .
according to the museum it is the surviving din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the th@@ igh .
the creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long peaks that ra@@ ged from his shoul@@ ders .
the researchers believe that the tra@@ pped plant car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res was w@@ alled by the Western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river was fl@@ ut@@ ed into the open sea .
but the grass cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arms in an exquisite detail .
the remains of this special specimen is so well preserved , that the hood of the skin are still hol@@ oc@@ ated tanks along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a matter of conservation is as &apos; rare like a lot@@ tery in lot@@ tery .
the more I see it , the it is conf@@ using it .
the remains of the skin still cover the hol@@ ocaust plates that carry the skull of the beast .
his right hand side is on his side , his five fingers have been split up .
I can count the sheds on his sole . &quot;
in the th@@ under@@ storm : massage table on A8 : many injured
fier@@ c@@ ous accident on Thursday evening at the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a massage table .
there are numerous verses , kilomet@@ er@@ ors long styles - and aff@@ aff@@ er .
on the Autobahn Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , on the late Thursday afternoon , 20 people have been injured .
according to the first information on the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed at 17.00 hrs between the connection set Adel@@ zh@@ ausen and O@@ del@@ zh@@ ausen ( County A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , during a pl@@ ating , almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , inter@@ connecting .
concerning the exact number of the last pl@@ agues , there are no data .
it was light for mild to moderate injuries , a Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ ver said .
a large array of lif@@ eb@@ ral vehicles was on the accident .
the A8 was fully blo@@ cked towards Munich .
in the direction of Munich , there were some ten kilometres long back@@ ward in the direction of Munich .
like a AZ @-@ repor@@ ter , it was also on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - helped by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade was not@@ ated the label of the vehicle hand@@ leb@@ ars who now have to calculate with delicate off@@ ences .
shortly after 18 : 45 , there was a second accident at the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it was a coll@@ ision of a coll@@ ision between an Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once more : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or one has deep@@ ens in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ered .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and wo@@ ke an un@@ gently or irrit@@ ate the driver in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the periods of breaks are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently the best navig@@ ator control .
it is simply confirmed by phone , that one has taken up its place and evalu@@ ates the ticket to the ticket .
currently a test run run on two routes .
&quot; come up the offer , we share it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will then be available to many other correspondence circuits in Germany in the beginning of the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a track speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; call the train ticket use without Schaff@@ ner .
however , to use the use , however , some conditions must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to booked an online ticket - what to do most passengers already .
you must also have bought the DB Navigator &apos;s App , which is why the most convenient way of ticket booking is to be purchased .
and last one needs a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works so : one increases in the train , calling the ticket below &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the test customers a button appears to electronic compensation .
the train att@@ endant has a message to their mobile devices , that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X is located in the train and the booked seats Y has taken .
comes the train att@@ endant with the ticket inspection at space Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already valuable online ticket .
so you can continue to continue , continue , further silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the road - what else to use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; who would like to travel without ticket control by our train accompanying personnel , check in the DB Navigator simple .
this enables the passengers to design their journey time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management Board of DB correspondence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to enter the individual needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travels , knows that in addition to del@@ ays and missed trains the ticket controls are to be controlled to the biggest off@@ ences .
for often , in any case one of the passengers do not require all documents that one needs to use online tickets for the use of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or the identity document must be specified .
the result are infinite discussions between train att@@ endant and passenger , which leads to worse mood in the section or large room and del@@ ays in control of your own tickets and Schaff@@ ner takes the time at the end of the time to worry about others .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this is also only at ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same route are not yet available .
how one activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to her core .
just one day after they arrived in New York City , the St. Louis Command@@ o sat on the bed of a Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment which they rented and sc@@ roll through Facebook on their phone .
they are proud of a mail from someone out of the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; name was there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
conf@@ used , since no one had posted information on their feed , she completed Facebook and opened Twitter .
one user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly prayed in their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed live .
he posted a picture of brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body , which was stretched in the street and stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was not new for her and community .
she laid her mobile phone in order to return to T@@ we@@ et in the evening on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were pictures of the police band and people , crying , and from a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription : &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ ons Police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they observed a live feed when a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a small dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said that another polic@@ eman put his ri@@ f@@ le , and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell remin@@ ded her testimony . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ ust@@ omed to us and who can call it typically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in that moment I felt sh@@ ook fro@@ st .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
they booked a return trip and went to the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock they took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from their father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive on the next morning to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary movie , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from 11 .
it is a history of survival , the love and the loss , the power and resistance , which consists of the point of view of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to ask answers .
as far as Fer@@ rell , her daughter , brought a cau@@ lif@@ ter and a matching crown to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , said the two a conversation , which they had in@@ numer@@ able times in the morning &quot; on the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remembered how I taught you when black men have to fight for this , what do they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered that which she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take them away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
you must know it and see it in it .
it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organization , but also know the various layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do to free ourselves to liber@@ ate ourselves .
even if I have lucky enough to give you an experience in which she personally witn@@ essed a ek@@ lat@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is not unlike the next black women child .
I feel the feeling I would prove their bad service to keep it far away . &quot;
the first stop when they arrived in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that was at a camp site when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ indictment by Offic@@ ers Wilson .
there are Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined a local business lovers who made lunch .
they prepared pockets for and hal@@ ting them on protest@@ ers .
slowly a new way of acti@@ vis@@ m began to be found in Fer@@ rell shape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my share visa has changed after the 9th of August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , and notice that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ ative Association and focused on eating righteousness and health in@@ equality in black municipalities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come to everything . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sh@@ rell during an evening demonstration of Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; fol@@ ay@@ an said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wanted to document what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one question was Fer@@ rell in the meaning : &quot; would you document , or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
this sc@@ ep@@ sis was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from White - in a community who benef@@ ited from their pain and resistance .
as follow I recently explained in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who were born in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on and raised up their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , a artist from the area that is well @-@ known for his acti@@ vis@@ m rum around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ ct occup@@ ants .
his commitment brought the project closer , along with six other loc@@ als followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me as these people are represented , for so I will be presented . &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on fer@@ rel@@ ing experience - to show that it is not around the movement &quot; not around a commun@@ ion , but in order to come together , &quot; said fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved the most obvious number of participants in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sur@@ prisingly personal aspects of fer@@ rel@@ ates life as she loves and married her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain danger of injury during this work and the formation of the black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ i &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the bro@@ ader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three fo@@ unders of the movement , who have marked the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in the year 2012 , identi@@ fying the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried a total of &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thus we fight with various fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , pregnant women have to bear the main last load of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an , noted that &quot; the movement of the black women and many black women is kept upright . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is however , however , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a certain type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Fer@@ rell was selected as the heart of the film &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook the energy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a co@@ incidence , though she was in front of the front , because with a life of these clo@@ cks than a black , pregnant woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news eras in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on have gone far , but the political connections between the church and the police continued to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on proof for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
it describes the social atmosphere of the region that calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nevertheless , she cl@@ ed to a song and she feels committed to this memory since then she went to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on in three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love one another and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; Or@@ w@@ ahn &quot; : TV readers discuss about Bit @-@ Gallery
the bit gallery travels the people , although they are not yet built .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south of the pedestrian zone has been ro@@ red since the first presentation of 2009 the population in advoc@@ acy and opponents .
the topic hardly can hardly be cold .
on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg , &quot; the theme will be discussed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one for the Bit Gallery say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not need a man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the fears re@@ build that a gallery attrac@@ ts more customers into the city , including those who benefit other businesses , fear the adversaries , that the pedestrian zone is ble@@ ed .
in addition , the gallery is planned right on the property , on which the farm market stands , in which 13 directors are offering their products .
it will be at the beginning of the construction work .
the Gallery M@@ acher wants to integrate a market hall in the new building - namely the Bed@@ a Square with possibility to sit outside .
Simone Room : &quot; we &apos;ve been buying almost weekly in the pe@@ asant market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the country are very happy again .
the but@@ chers are also discovered for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would like that , during and especially after the building of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in other cities there is that too .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct market is settled in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is likely to be extremely low with the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva Kil@@ ic : &quot; what shopping do in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , thr@@ illing or supermarkets : I find the su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are already enough in our city .
you see how many shop stores are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is so important that us stays at least the market stands .
because after all , the goods offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer , and is ob@@ serves .
as you can see , shop stores are rented in a shopping mall only of larger companies , because the local rentals are often not portable for a single retail@@ er .
shame , special stores are almost no longer and what else is remaining , will probably disappear even yet . &quot;
Wolf F@@ trade : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit for Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farms market place during construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery can actually be actually sometimes .
or does it already generate the &quot; Bit Gallery already before , all shops made from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it is simply not working .
and shopping center that stands empty , no one needs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but for a pe@@ asant market place it give thanks to the mad man many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg has no place anymore .
when the pe@@ asant market hall is made , again a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which hang almost infinite - the hanging of cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ a and Haar@@ lem , who were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence analy@@ tics developed a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after having been conce@@ aled diplomatic messages about the site of Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
the new exhibition , opened on 2 August , is A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was transformed in technology , computer science and art , and whose condem@@ nation was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his ministry .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been extracted from Mann@@ ing that was extracted from Mann@@ ing , and from the 30 portraits of portraits , such as someone might be interpreted using these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways , as they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ants of these interpre@@ tations , but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born in Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already been open to the identification as Mrs. Brad@@ ley , was convicted in 2013 for 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations of the sp@@ ying law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison , her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a grain , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing sits un@@ comfortable on a driver and a plat@@ in@@ bl@@ onde per@@ ished - with which it was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came back from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
it produced the artist portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic ar@@ te@@ facts such as cigarette dum@@ b and chew@@ ing g@@ um , extracted the DNA from the tr@@ ash in order to produce a picture of it as these people could look like .
this was the time where it received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; declared De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit at this time and could not be photograph@@ ed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
in the course of two years , the artist and her imprisoned M@@ use were inter@@ changeable , which inter@@ changeable several letters over the course of two years .
they even made one of Sho@@ ili can@@ y@@ o illustrated com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ liers &apos; , which would be a future fore@@ seen , in which the President of Chel@@ ical Jud@@ ges , and it would be able to see the exhibition personally .
indeed , just a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings , after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome kind of lucky meetings .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition , something deep and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ t from the government camps and against Trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able way to re@@ medy the star@@ ters , which he should actually do , further fl@@ ames .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , after the strange timing of all these things , it said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a laying on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for man@@ ing with her super@@ great signature among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is an end of &quot; automatic movement , whose basis , gender , breed , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - an exchange of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ kle@@ ot@@ ide according to the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , such as amazing , at least in biological ways , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people are hop@@ efully will take care of our gen@@ ome that we are and how openly about genetic data for a interpretation and as sub@@ jective they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , trace mem@@ ories , is also visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition which is kept in a separate room is a page from the above @-@ mentioned com@@ ic Nov@@ el .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as it appeared with a hands @-@ free ef@@ on in hand from the discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ bar@@ racks of the United States as king @-@ Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they set your spe@@ eches , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; never , never the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who salute you out of Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get your sigh@@ ted when I speak . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition yet personally - as it was looking forward in the com@@ ic@@ book - but if it should do it , then she is gre@@ eted in the middle of the room from the mas@@ ks , which is like hor@@ des of Protest@@ ants gathered .
this was also targeted , as everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ log@@ ists were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had her to the wall , but I wanted to feel like a human amount , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that was formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which also behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and a university professor for murder
a country @-@ wide human hunt is professor at the North@@ western University and a staff of the Oxford University , which was considered a susp@@ ects in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly bre@@ aches .

the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several pins passed away .
a report by the police authority in Chicago published a warning system that the dead was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to its body .
Corn@@ ell Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared on the place of the event for dead , and det@@ ec@@ tives investig@@ ating the stit@@ ches as murder , while police actively seeks to susp@@ ect the two susp@@ ects .
since 2007 L@@ ath@@ em has been a special professor for micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president of the university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em now has been assessed and be ruled out of the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case given by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesperson for the university and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are able to help with the police in Britain in touch and ready to help US investigations to any possible way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want to set himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
chief Communications Officer of the Police Authority of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said he demanded the susp@@ ects to susp@@ ect the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has an idea of its residence , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building super@@ vis@@ ter of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just received a big tip that happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel treatment .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , it is un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : &quot; the police currently works at the time axis and the background of the op@@ pers , and resear@@ ches a variety of moti@@ ves , including a possible domestic failure . &quot;
&quot; we will conclu@@ de the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian Viz@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
Russian Vice President Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said , it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of ful@@ filling the criteria of the Sche@@ dule , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ doping control ) .
the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this regard , &quot; declared Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA to compliance with the code that describes the criteria for the re@@ unification of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko he doesn &apos;t contain anything for the occasion of Russia .
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria mentioned in the list is noted that Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping authorities approved the reported results from the Canadian attor@@ ney at Richard McLaren to alleged state sponsored D@@ op@@ ings in Russian sports .
regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we lead the investigation into an error where our anti @-@ doping system has collap@@ sed .
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no state programmes , and we will not be something that exists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mut@@ k@@ os Wor@@ ds voted by Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with Russian sales office R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v gave problems of the past in Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping organizations , but then added : &quot; we repeated that the report contains controversi@@ al positions and regulations .
no one has added to accept this report un@@ conditi@@ onally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 during the D@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als of the WA@@ DA from the implementation of D@@ op@@ ing@@ control in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the main building of the Organisation in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA will be moving in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can come closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree visibility in experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano who direc@@ ts the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders &quot; employment relations . &quot;
companies began to take eth@@ ics , values , and employee commitment in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collap@@ sed because of eth@@ ical violations of the En@@ ron sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies detected that you could not prevent their dirty clothes online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology for monitoring the eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ ters provide your software as a service , and ass@@ els the company with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the consent of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors , which have both start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ tible received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the capital was raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $ 60 million .
this investment is hardly surprising , in view of the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s staff are expected to expect more than before .
in competitive markets such as Sil@@ icon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only .
employees want to have the feeling that you are accepted and estimated that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if the people are glad to be able to feel in a company that they have heard their voices , and that the work that you will do , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and P@@ ye@@ e Experience in Link@@ ed@@ In , both Conver@@ tible and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors reach R@@ end@@ ites , if its portfolio companies run well . companies run well , if employees are working and engaged .
if the Analytics Tools Third promised to increase its commitment and the use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on the collabor@@ ative work is important according to experts of the workplace culture .
but the data are us@@ eless when the company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees following your feedback , it can be a anticip@@ ation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come quickly enough , or at all cannot , these dis@@ appoint@@ ments and employees can be fulfilled .
&quot; if you ask for 4.000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 convers@@ ations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who have seen the company to have left the collecting of data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you take care of this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t take care of this , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Madison Reed , who through now monthly message surveys have been able to initi@@ ate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , deliver@@ er .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , she was able to re @-@ organize multiple teams within the company and to add multiple teams within the company to manage the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights over the staff , and it hopes that for a long view , this leads to a better commitment of employees in a sector , known for high sales .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose your company .
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ins
it goes at 23 o &apos;clock when a bun@@ ch of U@@ CL@@ A @-@ Foot@@ ball@@ player is on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have gone out their tri@@ k@@ ot@@ ober@@ des and show the back full of silence from the first day of training camp .
a lunch break for a good part of the team represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final tests after the three @-@ hour exercise before they return to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 a.m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s for the guys the next three days a real tri@@ ret@@ mill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ CL@@ A should begin at 19 : 15 , in order to meet the already fully packed time @-@ lay@@ outs of the players .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day , at which the brood @-@ ins post@@ pon@@ ed almost a week after the last season , and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six game times carried out in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are supposed to keep 18 exercises in the course of August . 20 before the formal games for their start against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that it supports the change in the N@@ CAA support , even if they add the many @-@ time routes of the player another point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous load three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just have stopped , they pl@@ agu@@ ed , they are great men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I guess as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices as soon as the camp ends , as soon as the clear sight of its fields of an adjacent parking place and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of elevated class , which was already fitted with pe@@ eling walls , which will be a light function behind a tor@@ rent .
Bru@@ ins @-@ players are supposed to occup@@ y the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a dre@@ amed that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will deplo@@ y our security &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not to be brought to think that people rent a room there and then set it on it to record a exercise .
if you have the video and of an exercise , it is quite good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best , with what we have .
I am not too much wor@@ ried about .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential products with Fal@@ sch@@ ann@@ um to third parties and show their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in a position on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible fal@@ ter reports and send them to the fact @-@ review , which may display the results of the fact test from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , of which many believe that they have also influenced the U.S. presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem is also become a major political theme in Europe with false stories , and Germany supported a plan to be punished by social media networks in May , after social media networks , to eliminate h@@ asser@@ t post@@ ings as soon as the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate explanation on German that in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts will be started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the knowledge that recru@@ ited stories from fact , the people want more context to meet well @-@ founded decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sarah Su , Product manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added a feature of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; test &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; test in connection &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to other changes on his messages feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a Com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squ@@ e@@ eze @-@ music video and was a si@@ p@@ ou@@ ch for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 and 1980 .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of tur@@ bul@@ ent history of his comfortable seat in the Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now for inspiration for an graphical novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ari@@ gen Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ fter with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; I think it is so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who is dead for 300 years , &quot; says he &apos;s we@@ aning .
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ a Castle in England &apos; surrounded the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , coming British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on a archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he is un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just re@@ acts on the thum@@ b impression on the side of a letter which was written by a double agents in the 1,@@ 700 years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that is his thum@@ b printing !
and they smell always to smoke , because it was kindled a fire because of light .
for someone who lives up to 300 years later , the smell has a effect as it would be even though .
Ah , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who is so with old papers is that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England , and almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be hon@@ est , &quot; I seems to be a little exc@@ essive &quot; ) everything seems to be true to be true .
Rho@@ dos spent his days to explore the Vic@@ tor@@ ian &quot; new &quot; Castle , expl@@ oring the archives and had the many treasures and cour@@ iers of the castle , such as the mon@@ t@@ ants had spent the centuries on the walls and the bottles , the centuries in the tr@@ ench .
he hi@@ ked through the site and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with land@@ sc@@ ams , gar@@ dener , and sometimes also with the artists who worked at the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key and began writing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was only received full access in 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
as a Rho@@ des a decade later , the employees first started to take care of the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which arist@@ ocr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Emp@@ ires , maps , who had said : &quot; one could mean that country conflicts could be bor@@ ing , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all his steps ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to go on a wider base to the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who is a man to leave the newly built castle to join the pe@@ as@@ antry of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot who appeared in the castle with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famil@@ ies of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pe@@ as@@ antry arose in this area and I thought , a revol@@ t was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe they are connected together ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that told the story of the Jesu@@ it Pat@@ tern , the family of Dar@@ rell hid seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell is represented in the 18th century , who filled his own fun@@ eral , filled a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that was removed only years later than his sar@@ g was excav@@ ated ) .
the Her@@ rel@@ les are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ia : &quot; the gent@@ l@@ emen seemed to be di@@ stra@@ ight@@ ful G@@ aun@@ er , always make debts and spend money for things that they couldn &apos;t aff@@ ord .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ Men sol@@ der their debt cr@@ ises , having married rich old women - I place them as a bun@@ ch of good looking guys , with a talent to promote pe@@ as . &quot;
after the end of its application in the castle Rho@@ des is looking for another unique scre@@ am experience
he has spent a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about El@@ se@@ än@@ m@@ ä@@ ki behind him , the grounds of a san@@ atorium dating from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ alled by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to get finished back with the dam@@ n life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the cover of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef last Friday their campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) .
still until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team to hold Nelson Art@@ z will keep the logo and the slogan .
at the end of August , the campaign will be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ask the makers of action since yesterday at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we think this ( of course ! ) does not really &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write them on her yesterday released website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and in order to make clear that man@@ ches are better than it seems .
basically , we are the firm convic@@ tion that we know as a bath of Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the promotion there is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a stand@@ able promise , one that gives the city an un@@ mist@@ ak@@ ably sole location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , up in the competition with other municipalities .
a medium five @-@ digit amount allows the City of Bad Honnef its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an fear of the army
every year , in the beginning of August , on Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) are enrolled in officers and carried out at the officer &apos;s officer .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the session took place no longer in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but at the office seat of the Prime Minister .
on the consultations , under the chair@@ manship of the government , the five Vice @-@ Premier@@ s and the Minister for Defence , Interior , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
thus , the civilians were in the Y@@ as in the Over@@ number .
the government attrac@@ ts the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the man@@ ders of the army , the aerial forces and the Navy have been depos@@ ed .
since the failed Cou@@ p , head of State Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of 326 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ ers have been frozen .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the Army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as a wire of the coup .
against 486 people , which have been involved in the coup attempt , has been involved in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup attempt , Erd@@ og@@ an had called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wor@@ ds &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he called his opportunity to give him the opportunity to clean the forces &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but has Erd@@ og@@ an is really in handle ?
at the end of February the newspaper &quot; hur@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ be@@ hagen in the Military headquarters . &quot;
in the General Staff there is no concern for an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ati@@ zation &quot; of the army which manifest@@ ing himself in the repe@@ al of the header for Sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper .
the armed forces of the army and security forces remain in any case .
in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ og@@ an dismissed another 73@@ 95 state service , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
it seemed that I felt an@@ og@@ an on the military .
the gener@@ als used to be the actual gent@@ l@@ emen of the country .
three times more co@@ aches in appeal to their role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the world@@ ly state rules .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an ur@@ ged the power of the military step by step , not least to appeal to the reform of the European Union .
former officers say , Erd@@ og@@ an crit@@ erion well targeted a Islam@@ ist of armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned an un@@ authorised officer who was seeking for asylum under the country of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full extrem@@ ists and sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meets this , the NATO could not leave it cold .
there are no doubt in the Alliance according to the pur@@ ge of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operations of operations are &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will give a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited from the media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he sees to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter requirements for a long @-@ term work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supports President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the convention .
&quot; this Act will reduce poverty , reduce wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by the United States will change the way as the citizens from other countries Green Cards . &quot;
the Law will prevent the chains of migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will benefit the candidates , who speak English to support the financial resources to support itself and knowledge , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media .
Ministry of the Ministry for racing section shuttle san@@ itation
again , over the past months the future of the race of the race of the race has been fought - now it is supposed to go quickly .
before the end of the year the travel route is to be built , on which the tourist path is to be built .
in order to secure the future of the racing section sh@@ utt@@ les long @-@ term , according to the information on the transport of the Ministry of Transport in this year , construction works will begin in this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order to order the route Ilmenau @-@ race @-@ enh@@ ancing , the country knows especially for the tourism key , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Road State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l announced on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the repair of the route decreased to about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country over@@ take 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle service will also be ordered in the future of the country , will now be defin@@ iti@@ vely voted , &quot; explained S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen railway as operators are already in front of the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the road@@ map that negoti@@ ated vehicles and quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Society will be closed for a period of eleven years .
so that the race track will be available from December 2017 .
the rac@@ er shuttle is an especially popular railway connection between the Ilmenau and racing train stations in front of tourists .
during the past months , in the course of a pilot operation , the circuit of sufficient many people were used to order them back in the future .
the distance is also strong in parts .
the asc@@ ension of sex @-@ robots is real , and we should worry about
just as you thought it could not be mad in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex @-@ robots .
Yes , in fact .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on developing sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we need to start their asc@@ ension .
customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its form of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fingers .
&quot; people are talking about them , but the company deliver lots of them , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key at the publication of his new report .
modern S@@ exp@@ o have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone , which feels warm , with the human reactions that can be achieved through artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust its robots to &quot; adjust , &quot; and choose everything from the eye colour of the robot to the form of the ni@@ pp@@ le to the type or the color of his fingers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is still missing , as many robots to possess the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person@@ alities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is progressive in Step@@ ford @-@ Woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern rop@@ es have developed to robots with a silic@@ ate skin .
the Real@@ bot@@ ix robot makes it possible to adapt their robots to adapt their robots to the properties , such as ti@@ mid@@ ity .
and then there is yet the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed person@@ alities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of the ti@@ tern@@ ity and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality who has been adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the site of True Compan@@ ion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so do you like that you like , and do not like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , it also has its mood - all like real people !
you may be tired of dis@@ vers@@ ation , or be fixed to conversation ! &quot;
there are many be@@ fallen aspects with this rise of sex @-@ robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ jec@@ ting female traits - but one step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is here : resi@@ sted ) Far@@ rah , un@@ quiet one most .
true true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why can men do not have any Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fat or just another sex playing .
their formation and increasing refin@@ ement indicate a little dar@@ ker and deep@@ est in our culture , to a withdrawal from the Ideal of equality of gender equality at a wish to sex with sub@@ jec@@ tions as optional .
most of the men of course will not hold sex robots , and during the FR@@ R , their rising popularity remains preliminary , however , they are still pro@@ vision@@ ally on the edge of consumer culture .
but what went through the bound@@ aries , in relation to the spirit of time , where we live , very instru@@ c@@ tive .
and many people are not a strange or ins@@ ul@@ ting , until the free market being permission granted .
there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that this highly developed sex robot in a time sc@@ uba diving , in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a pre@@ h@@ end in the White House , who calls for women to have sexually mature in the White House .
the most horri@@ ble aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the handmaid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the un@@ defiled body and the extinct eyes , but how realistic these vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump .
the target behind this sex rob@@ ot@@ ers is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to real women as realistic as technically possible ( even if also with Por@@ no@@ star @-@ Pro@@ por@@ tions ) .
their engineers want to feel human , that they re@@ prove the movement of a real body .
but , on the point , if it is around their &quot; person@@ alities , &quot; the robot does not represent real women .
they can not be separated from their companion or just away .
they have no placement or background history , nothing , anything on independence or anything , what the fantasy of total sub@@ jection could distur@@ b .
different expressed : they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves .
or to express it in the Rede@@ mption of 2017 : maid service
tr@@ umps big power ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney into the heart of the healthy human mind
it is become a Bin@@ sen@@ ic of the Tr@@ ump era that the political circuits , which have already divided the U.S. elec@@ torate , also families were split in small format .
around Christmas and Ern@@ est dan@@ ces there were in the United States of newspapers with advice about how to choose a hor@@ ror from Tr@@ ump to choose relatives .
we have told us all supp@@ os@@ edly to run our filter bub@@ bles .
in less notice the power of Tr@@ umps , Family has been merged .
I mentioned this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ oriented poet who lives in Chicago , and has long been busy with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family since long time in New York .
it rec@@ alled me that the unit can have a mighty effect against a common enemy .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone knows whom she knows , including the republi@@ can relationship , with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and very strange on the same page .
in order to be the dining table , certainly a good thing , but it falls in a further context that this also brings significant risks with itself .
the left hand was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the issu@@ ing effect of his Presidency has the power to move us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we speak &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we refer to the gr@@ asp@@ ing possibility that we will not stum@@ ble his p@@ itt@@ ens of a day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there is a fri@@ gate long @-@ term scenario , in the Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; normal@@ ized , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards suddenly as in@@ tox@@ ication of failure .
I found myself from an active nost@@ algia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney ur@@ com@@ ic version of the tra@@ des@@ ks , which saw 14 % income tax ( but at least did we know how his tax statement ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact occur in a very mild criminal off@@ ences .
if Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be only mentally healthy to qualify as an un@@ meas@@ ur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin in the city was , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the top of the New York Park , and the top three dollars that one can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs in the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ rig and the animals are turning to look full of her own shoul@@ ders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ ing music .
as many sounds of a city , the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines will be familiar to provide a lot of exc@@ it@@ ement , and the reality of the city is not just a dream .
five and thirty years later , and I &apos;m not yet totally over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the topics @-@ pub ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a large roundabout in Northern London .
however , Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sel is still a strange experience , since there two two years old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ 40 years can go and all have a great time .
if I could rate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him full score , but no man was asked .
on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in coffee at the corner of my road it is the same as the option to retri@@ eve the evaluation with a 15 % tip - this in order to purchase something about the shop .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also exercises pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation that is not required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ ze , while I am tired of experience , you have to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with breast pain transferred from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year , he was transferred to the hospital for the treatment of snap@@ shots to the hospital , which he suffered the prison authorities according to a fall in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder of the Prosecutor &apos;s appeal .
he killed ste@@ enk@@ in in the early hours of Valent@@ ina in 2013 by turning them several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria on them .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his gir@@ l@@ friend for a night int@@ ru@@ ur@@ ant who hidden himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal against the six @-@ year prison sentence by Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , who they say that she was to op@@ aque .
the National Criminal attor@@ neys said that it will be fo@@ ster@@ ed at the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the ob@@ jection could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as last of the flo@@ wer@@ ed schools , the four @-@ t@@ ug@@ gh@@ ters from fo@@ unders and ep@@ ig@@ ho@@ fen were dismissed in the holidays and into the secondary schools .
three of the students will continue to go on high school , four at the secondary school .
school teacher Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the civil house Bi@@ es@@ ental in Ep@@ fen@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol for the school release , the 29 pupils of the four grades under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young e@@ ag@@ les , which grows in chicken , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; along with this the piv@@ ot Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The eagle in chicken yard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to break out of his chick@@ ens .
instead of a chicken dish , a small e@@ ag@@ les came out .
but hope to make a chicken out of him , the e@@ ag@@ les spread its wings on a high mountain , and s@@ ware .
after that , the classes shown three and four in the study of Y@@ v@@ onne Frank a chicken dance .
the hen d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinders contributed to the bet .
the Eagle stand for the integration , said school teacher Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young is indeed different than the other young animals ( cows ) , but belong to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
its provision is to be free .
they wanted every quad@@ r@@ all@@ ug@@ ly that he feels at his new school .
there were than@@ k@@ word to the col@@ leg@@ es , the former school@@ master Michael Müller , who is always jumps back to education , and the parents represented .
the cows time is over , declared Class Teacher Sophia Schumacher .
they leave their pupils after two years of lessons , because it had been a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the quad@@ ru@@ bs .
for completion , all students left a song of summer time and holiday season .
in the midst of the children broke great joy .

arrested two Bulg@@ arians due to illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .
on the morning of August 1 , in Si@@ th@@ onia a group was arrested by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day she was released , while currently an investigation began .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have intensi@@ fied the control of the free camp and place every one that is found to stay in a place which is not intended for this purpose , that is not intended for this purpose .

software update for diesel vehicles : what the data subject must now know
how exactly does the software update instead ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
overview of the most important questions and answers .
in the diesel @-@ summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they should improve the emission behaviour of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of ACE Auto Club Europe is ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the updated software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates are only valid for the vehicles created by Schumann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has ordered the Federal Chancell@@ ery of the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a fast implementation in the next few months , but it &apos;s not called any exact date .
Daimler has informed to write any person concerned .
if there be an inspection in inspection , it will be settled in their framework .
how long will the equipment take up in total ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ anin believes .
the connections from the presence of the manufacturer as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , the car manufacturers do not deal with the topic of environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long shall the update take ?
the re@@ armament itself could last only three to four hours .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
what do motor@@ ists do not take by car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group ?
the ACE should wait for waiting .
presumably , foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is now a massive price reduction of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE will be feared .
but just in the regions where drivers are dro@@ pping .
in rural areas there is no impair@@ ments for older diesel .
the ACE should not wait for sale with a sale .
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most beautiful events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be polit@@ ically .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
LL Cool J ( 49 ) wins as the first rac@@ apper , one of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the cultural setting on Thursday announced , this year singer Gloria E@@ ste@@ fan ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) as well as the chore@@ ograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will organ@@ ise a reception and together with his wife Mel@@ ania together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the winner of the progressive TV series announced that the winner Le@@ ar announced that for participation in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This presidency has decided to escape the arts and human rights of neg@@ lec@@ ted - them even the means - and that charged me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old E@@ ste@@ fan stressed it will take advantage of the conversation with Tr@@ ump to procla@@ im their visibility .
the Kennedy &apos;s former President John F. Kennedy named Kennedy @-@ Centre is the largest cultural position in the US capital .
the former prize winners are Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom Han@@ ks and St@@ ing .
we make the city li@@ fel@@ ong
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ hab@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ Buil@@ der , goes back to R@@ ente in the coming year .
the place is already written - suitable candidates are ra@@ r .
since 31 years W@@ acker City Buil@@ der has been working .
and the work is still great fun , as he was medi@@ ated in the press conference .
it reports a varied but challenging tasks that are waiting for his successor .
at the same time it ad@@ mi@@ red that no application might be filled with the requirement profile .
the town is looking for the next possible time a architects or building engineer .
so - in regard of the regular notice period - still enough time for a el@@ aboration .
since Has@@ lach has been responsible for the administrative community as a sub @-@ legal entity , the candidate must apply accordingly .
for this function wants to keep the city definitely .
if it would not be able to complete this , you would have to go out the citizens to revel@@ ations up to Offen@@ burg .
but it is important that the city and himself is important , says W@@ acker who reported from a good operational li@@ ma as well as good mood among authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , which looks back with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building office and its staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Dutch parking lot are targeted .
the Cin@@ que bridge between B@@ oll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium is still subject .
the latter is estimated with around 1.5 million euros to be@@ ech , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; estimates W@@ acker .
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my followers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work here is fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
design for a city @-@ designed large game room present .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s its own buil@@ ders and a gar@@ dener can be flexi@@ bly re@@ acted on multiple ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so W@@ acker , and the creation of the gre@@ enery will often be praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town is under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye to have what does it fit , &quot; when new buildings will be approved , emphas@@ ises the separ@@ ating town maker .
the city Buil@@ der carries high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything is going on my table here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for supervision and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( High building ) has been working here for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ berg ( Deep construction ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor will remain long , W@@ acker says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we seek someone who really identified and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operational li@@ ma , but also for the other design of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whosoever would like to inherit Roland W@@ acker , a graduate engineer or Bachelor &apos;s degree , should have studied architecture and specialist knowledge in the fields of construction and construction materials .
construction of urban planning , construction management , construction management , Gr@@ under @-@ office opportunities , municipal operational settlement with building court and urban gar@@ dener as well as sub @-@ law authority , including monument protection .
bicycle on lines thrown : South @-@ rail closed
according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bike of the railway track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so bad@@ ly damaged that the her@@ edit@@ ary freight train had to be stopped .
the investigations go from two male offen@@ ders and are looking for the night hours after them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; close to the Tat@@ ort were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ros@@ ary rolling and a bike drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ ying landscape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to A@@ PA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or the perpet@@ rators of the offen@@ ders themselves have killed himself in large risk and vulner@@ able to mig@@ rate traffic .
in addition to the damage at the Lo@@ k and the plant , as well as the delay @-@ minute drive and the cost of rail traffic could also come to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum in total , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage were fixed on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the South route could be guided without disabilities .
almost ten persons were fri@@ gh@@ tened morning , two of them consider the correspondence .
goods are not accounted for , but they had a delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced by approximately 200 metres of upper lines .
ins@@ ul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( inflamm@@ atory intest@@ inal disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study asser@@ ts exactly the contrary : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based protein and dairy products , the symptoms of patients with ign@@ iting represent@@ ations could occur .
the in@@ hal@@ able condition , which affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom , 300,000 , causes mag@@ nets and bub@@ bles , recur@@ ring or bloody di@@ cases , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
during the person concerned , meat and dairy products have to avoid their symptoms found at Q@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University , researchers found that the essential amino acid Tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an of proteins joined proteins , promote immune cells , which promote a toler@@ ant gut .
the Chief researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna stated that immune cells was pat@@ rol in the Dar@@ m to ensure that harmful micro@@ ben , who hide themselves in the body , do not penet@@ rate the body .
cells that are capable of dis@@ able , inflamm@@ ation of cells are balanced that protect the tolerance and protect the body without any sensitive t@@ issues .
if the balance is too far in the direction of inflamm@@ ation , it can result in a anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory disease .
in experiments , it was determined that a kind of tolerance is the immune cell in mice , which carry a certain bacter@@ ium in its inn@@ ards .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an - one of the blocks of proteins - to resol@@ ve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between an bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us re@@ uter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ ine micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an mice had the mice in their food , the more had they had this immune cells . &quot;
it struck that the combination of L. re@@ uter@@ i and one of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an abundant nutrition toler@@ ate , less inflamm@@ atory bo@@ ot@@ us , if the same system also work with people .
the post @-@ doctoral prizes of Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was trying to support the tolerance as she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but a different group of the same tribe , which was separated from that .
it assumed that the difference was to do with the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ omen of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ us that usually live in the stomach intest@@ ines .
the mice of mice were found DNA sequ@@ encing and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells , but lack@@ ed them in mice .
mice were missing in a ster@@ ile environment , so that a intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they were not developed by the immune cells , and they received the L. re@@ uter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacter@@ ias ex@@ presses the immune system , the researchers led L. re@@ uter@@ i in a fluid and then over@@ led small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on imm@@ mature immune cells , which were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant cells of cells .
as the active component of the liquid has been cleaned , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an Met@@ abol@@ ism , which is known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 @-@ m@@ actic acid .
if the researchers have doubled the amount of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in the feed of mice increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ ag@@ ings were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice , and that most of us L. re@@ uter@@ i protect the most of us L. re@@ uter@@ i in our stomach @-@ intest@@ ines .
it is not known that Tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an @-@ side products from L. re@@ uter@@ i the cells in people as such as mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an were found in humans with anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of this cells is probably something that we want to promote that cells are inflamm@@ ation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially can lead high tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an@@ values in the presence of L. re@@ uter@@ i to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic .
in Manchester United , with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic a &quot; gen@@ ius , &quot; Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut at S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pounds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins , and impres@@ sively in the holder role as people as Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira in Belgian .
M@@ atic was however , however , from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blu@@ es , had only 45 minutes , what Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho took advantage that he had to improve the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he th@@ inks of football , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic started Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in the Avi@@ va @-@ Stadium , when Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho made his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed in this week that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho wanted to wish three more new commit@@ ments , but he in@@ si@@ sted that the club had already made a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to fulfil three of its four pre @-@ level new commit@@ ments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three out of four , I thank the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they are four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state of Michigan , and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner to the USA , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was an endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
so the number &quot; 787 &quot; and the Boeing logo painted in the sky .
a new stop for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
like the wind , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel &apos;s b@@ ump@@ ed to the SPD , S &amp; D Prime Minister always looked at work with a certain concern for Berlin .
only no distur@@ ban@@ ks from the party centre , merely no other wind out of the covenant - as he was the main desire of the election .
since Martin Schulz takes the party , has changed fundament@@ ally .
since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus with grown @-@ out will watch the events in the SPD @-@ reg@@ ained state capit@@ als .
since the beginning of the year , which has been given from there since the beginning of the year , with counter@@ wind he had not been described in the approach .
it were low suggestions .
and one after another .
the Bund @-@ CD@@ U will see a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of SPD and gre@@ enery after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once more : red @-@ green is simply not reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber the editor network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fra@@ ction of an Gre@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was over@@ thrown by the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the Parliament election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its single vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ Federal Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner is asked to return to the Gre@@ ke T@@ jack@@ er Gre@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets , to publish its mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear violation of voters .
El@@ ke T@@ li@@ fe@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return to its mandate , &quot; said the Federal executive director and the campaign of the Green Party Commissioner for Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sigh@@ ed a SPD elections as the Friday morning the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ Message has reached the party centre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is after crossing the green members El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to CD@@ U without own government .
it is the provisional point of all the rows of large and small cr@@ ises in the SPD state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the mist@@ akes began with the un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly significant defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , no more , s@@ lows down the com@@ ra@@ de .
according to the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it was then - and it was clearly worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the SPD , and the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite was down smoothly .
the gene was packed during the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had exhau@@ sted new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him the next stop was .
Mayor O@@ laf Schol@@ z , the last severe SPD land , lost its Nim@@ bus at the same weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burnt .
and because he in the crisis of crisis , then everything was wrong , what you can do wrong .
since then Schol@@ z fighting for his political survival .
thus , Stephan Weil .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust gas emissions and his role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister has already been critic@@ ised in criticism since longer .
Mi@@ ese surveys were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps , because in recent weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and because in recent weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to put my acc@@ ents in the covenant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aspir@@ ation of former mayor of Hanover from Hanover to expand its power in Berlin , Martin Schulz remained not hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , because they promised himself as a stabil@@ ization of the party .
now the exact opposite can occur .
because , because of the party of internal forced nature , the Lower Saxony is basically no gu@@ ilt .
and Schulz is not at all .
then , the com@@ ra@@ des must therefore be closed to keep his own rows .
their wrath is aimed at the Green Party , and especially on the back@@ sliding par@@ li@@ ament@@ arians in T@@ li@@ fe@@ jack@@ ets .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democracy , as Mr@@ s T@@ li@@ fe@@ athers her own car@@ esses on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the Par@@ ap@@ ines in the SPD Parliament , the Edit@@ orial Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) .
Ms. T@@ li@@ fe@@ jack@@ ets is not elected as Director of the Lower Sax@@ on Green Party on the Assembly of the Lower Sax@@ on Green Party , but further strengthening of Lower Saxony members .
it would be the logical consequence that she returns its mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Parliament , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ eu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ torate of voters four years ago was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people have made Stephan Weil to the Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who led the Dutch SPD as a nickn@@ ame for the Bundestag election to the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are spar@@ ked the personal career of a future CD@@ U @-@ MPs the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there were more or more incoming orders of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony has been given .
conveyor belt for town centre III
who wants to settle house in the years can get enough support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of Ste@@ g Urban Development will receive on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a review to the so far .
since 1991 , it is included in the received renovation areas .
at that time , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the federal state of Baden @-@ Württemberg acquired two thirds of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the sub@@ sid@@ y amounted to at least 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous sanctions are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote the internal development , and not only new building areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , I have received the information from the government officials to receive the information that there is a san@@ itation zone III .
the funding amount is 8@@ 33 333 Euro , of which 500 000 Euro from the country , received the rest of the municipality .

&quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to investigate so Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;

core of the program are the Rev@@ it@@ alization of Interior capit@@ als , the improvement of the residential and working conditions and ob@@ taining and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would be objects related , that is called per plot .
finally , the rehabilitation area would then be defined as a statute .
the approval period for the funding period runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2017 .
even until September this year , however , the survey would only be carried out , as part of those involved in the rehabilitation area involved a questionn@@ aire .
as of November or December , the amendment to the amendment shall be made to begin with the renov@@ ations in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then declared that any Commun@@ e rel@@ ate the mentioned precau@@ tions to carry out examinations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is going to rate the town of town and decide when you are gentle , and in which circum@@ ference is . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there will be also a san@@ itation ratio in the basic register for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann also will come again after the received and make a picture of the location , promised them .
Got@@ zel stressed a major success factor for the project , the participation of the parties .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires that can be sent to citizens within the coming weeks , and to be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; building and living area , &quot; where it works among other things in the building condition and the rein@@ forcement prospects .
in the grey questionn@@ aire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , can be made to size , distribution and residents of a motorhome .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bow @-@ bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to fill in the building premises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , God proved to be aware that a filled questionn@@ aire does not have an application for funding at the same time .
in addition , new construction activities are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler emphas@@ ized that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; wind farm &quot; functional &quot; - who first comes , comes first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could not be used for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the conclusion , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ core II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make a restoration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fl@@ atter@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the cost of the White House costs the tax@@ pay@@ ers of thousands
the decision of the White House , a n@@ avy helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights the American production in the last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the information on the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president on board is , was the heart of the event on July 17th at the White House with American buil@@ ders .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helicopter in Connecticut was exhibited in addition to a yacht out of Ma@@ ine , a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft from Mississippi .
the White House , demanded the presence of helicop@@ ters in an frag@@ ment@@ ary order or fre@@ go , hardly 36 hours before the helicopter on the South La@@ wn , which is responsible for the operation of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted to know that , because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the event of his superior , the deputy naval base for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock and so long it remained until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
note , note that if departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the restriction of the service hours a second team would be needed for the return flight .
the original flight crew was found during the event at the helicopter , while security personnel down the unit remained on the ground during the time .
from the records presented by TI@@ ME , it wasn &apos;t clear whether the second flight crew was required .
the H@@ atch Act prohib@@ its federal state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked whether the event could viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; a question that we had asked if it was about a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds when you are locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by H@@ atch Act .
but official events have also political over@@ tones .
on the event , the President gave a violation of the reform of health reform , which was in the Senate in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to feed the government regulations .
using the aircraft , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon .
pre@@ sidents are obliged to use them for the trip .
but your use only require for a photo @-@ OP , is unusual .
Tr@@ ump led in February an investigation as the presidential plane in front of his first campaigns in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ Services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ain about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is fascin@@ ated by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states will be produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy head of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations frequently perform training flights in the region around Washington and in the South La@@ wn by to depos@@ e the US President in the White House with precise centi@@ metres movements .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led in the White House 58 exercise programmes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was counted among the training demand of the flight crew for the month , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew an additional 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers presented the load for any of the other acqu@@ isitions which were presented at the event .
a speaker of Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in writing the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not operate bud@@ get@@ ary drawings for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the approval of the US Defense Ministry for the Financial Year 2017 , the Do@@ D replacement for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
record of the aircraft records the flight time of the aircraft than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ anti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter type is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for the funds is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates contain staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs which contain within the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND @-@ study from 2015 , the funds for Do@@ D does not contain personnel costs , but consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at this time the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of helicop@@ ters for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present these week things , which are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er .
&quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I go out that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend .
and I think of most Americans are all proud of the Hel@@ icop@@ ter and other military equipment , for which many Americans have been un@@ ti@@ relessly .
it is of course appropriate to emphas@@ ize it . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ act with the helicopter , when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire brig@@ ade .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to Represent@@ atives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and the media about his own fleet of corporate products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very good &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss will begin tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at Tab@@ ulated Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
despite five games still mak@@ es@@ os@@ er balance sheet has won the peak re@@ union of the Second Tennis Bundesliga .
in any case , team Head Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay has respect of respect of the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team that plays always in quite a similar formation .
just in the back positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV , mainly the imports from the high North .
&quot; their Danish and fin@@ s can even be applied to the Davis Cup .
and they are too strong in the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with views of Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Sweden ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ör@@ en and Es@@ ben Ol@@ eses , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen , and Andreas B@@ jer@@ re@@ hus ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; that will always be difficult for us .
there you need a good portion of happiness . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team is practical for the trip in the high north .
his debut for blue @-@ white could be Maxim@@ e jan@@ vier .
at the Chall@@ enger tournament , it is currently active in the Chall@@ enger tournament in Italian Bi@@ ella , won &apos;t play the Bundesliga in the Czech Liber@@ ec tournament in the Czech Republic of Liber@@ ec at the Czech Republic ( Czech Republic ) for his first use in this season .
so far , the Chil@@ ean Hans Po@@ lip@@ nik Castillo was yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei Vas@@ il@@ ev@@ ski still at the ATP tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el at the ball .
he was also in the same time as Bot@@ ic Van de Zand@@ school , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ ans Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ cus could also back into the team .
it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary who was still the number one of juni@@ ors @-@ cat@@ tran@@ s , not filled with someone out of the trainer by Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay to K@@ ader .
how America can harm OMV
indeed , Donald Tr@@ ump did not work when he continued his signature under the law on the disappearance of the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his sense the law en@@ acted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did the congress contained a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction of Moscow was as sharp as expected , and themselves fo@@ aming Brussels against the U.S. stum@@ bling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft stip@@ ulates to pun@@ c@@ ate European companies that help the Rus@@ sians , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gas ep@@ ip@@ el@@ ines into the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors have been inv@@ oked in local OMV since then , together with other European companies , the construction of the Russian Ost@@ se@@ el@@ eit@@ ing Nord Stream 2 are co @-@ financed .
the drug is tremend@@ ous .
nevertheless , it is too early for a estim@@ ation of the consequences , thus the official statement of the oil Group .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanctions against the life by Donald Tr@@ ump .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; press has looked that the group could we@@ ave and could really do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el becomes the center of Net@@ fli@@ x in the center of Net@@ fli@@ x

the relay three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service , the first received its first trailer and showed the latest bows of the show .

&quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as a Fortune 500 company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with more state points and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;

down@@ ward : the city represents 46 kitchen ai@@ ds
the town organizes the K@@ ita @-@ lunch again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
the watch is turned back in the urban kinder@@ garten .
on 1 September , the city of Kre@@ feld acqu@@ ires the food supply in the urban kinder@@ garten equipment ( Kit@@ as ) .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz , Deputy Head of Youth Aid , this is a good news : &quot; we all pleased us all very pleased . &quot;
the bo@@ iled is still bo@@ iled beyond the house : a c@@ ater@@ er takes over this task and delivers fresh cooked cooled .
the city operates in the fields of district 46 kinder@@ garten workshops , in 44 the children get a warm meal .
in the last year of Kit@@ ā@@ l , 2800 children were at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; meanwhile , there are not only children who are cared for 45 week@@ days in the K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children up to 14 am remain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 partial time forces from 1 September kitchen service : they warm up the delivered food , supplement the meal , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ing the meal individually , give food out , cleaning and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz .
the size - there are two groups in like se@@ wn institutions - decides about the circum@@ ference of circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now firm to K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are stronger , and it is easier to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason it is : healthy eating and cook@@ ery classes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children shall help to prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power station to the team is useful .
also for children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known power in K@@ ita , a person who tru@@ sts in them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for children .
the cleans@@ ing of the K@@ ita @-@ premises - so far the task of the kitchen staff - will be settled in the future of special cleaning staff .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen unit also has the charm , that it is in comparison between self @-@ gover@@ ning and foreign policy to the city as the most economic situation , it is from the press office .
and this , although 46 part @-@ time forces will be hired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours fall at approximately 750 people in the gu@@ ardi@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not so strongly in weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;

G@@ MB @-@ concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie Factory in Glasgow
there are a union of union with managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie about the long @-@ term commitment to make production at Glasgow &apos;s work in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company weigh over the future of investing investment in the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the work , which is created next to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea K@@ ek@@ se .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pla@@ dis said , has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be experienced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the branch offices of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s , &quot; concerns that the financing of production lines will not be pre @-@ driven . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win no clari@@ fication on the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , affects our members .
generations of families have been working here and the workers are strongly concentrated on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , a major pillar for de@@ cent employment in an area with high unemployment and social discrimination .
therefore , under the perspective of employment , wage and wealth management , and before the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising living costs and chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow ur@@ gently need a floral design at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of Pla@@ dis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has just received a letter of G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to them as we appreciate the continuous engagement with employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed .
we discussed the employees that we operate like all companies that are working in an extremely competitive edge @-@ intensive and un@@ safe economic climate , our business will continuously check - and this applies to all our business segments and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested over 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , particularly in production lines and operating improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility and completely . if you change our business processes at the location , the employees and its trade union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La League likes her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not leave in her persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar after spending an offer of £ 189 million to resol@@ ve his free @-@ air condition , but they warned in Barcelona three years before the world war ?
the sensational base has been heated in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the last season for 89 million pounds of Manchester United .
after finishing N@@ ey@@ mar will be the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional sport@@ s@@ men of the world . PS@@ G has a wages of more than 500.000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is mad about the way , such as N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way to outside of the Catal@@ ans , although a source has always given its best order to worry about him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .
but the World Cup was warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president in front of this view ?
in Manchester City 2014 , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ har@@ ai@@ fi had a close warning for each club to sign one of the best player from PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not wor@@ ried because they want to touch one of our players , then we will contact us in opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded those line with the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G clearly made it that they would not allow it to travel out of Italy in any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest in which they lost their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican law &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of violence in the cathedral @-@ atzen with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measures &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding the over@@ handles in Regensburg , no one knows that it would be prevented for &quot; shame and con@@ com@@ bing acts &quot; , &quot; so the author Lu@@ c@@ etta S@@ car@@ aff@@ ia , histor@@ ian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Commit@@ tees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hab@@ it , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes S@@ car@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
princip@@ ally in Gloria von Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is said in the interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; one likes to go to the church , and that is a round fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it pointed out that in their youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a completely normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be ready to become ready . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they beg@@ at it un@@ fair , setting the standards on earlier decades , because the world have changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse , also Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often died .
fully to in@@ justice , author and histor@@ ian Michael H@@ emann , who translated &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say H@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has enhanced the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which was presented by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg , with the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ en@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually viol@@ ated from 1945 to the beginning of the 1990s , with a high pl@@ au@@ sibility &quot; victims of overweight , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was working in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 , &quot; summar@@ izing that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , physical and psychological violence were applied .
even in high emot@@ ion , the punishment for the pupils were also violent .
nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other accus@@ ations , many victims estimates the general humanity of R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even more positive memories . &quot;
in the interview , E@@ emann , why the final report about the w@@ ren@@ al sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ en@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion was declared .
Mr. H@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the inci@@ dents of violent practices at the Reg@@ en@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; provides an contra@@ dic@@ tory image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a lift , many students are out of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Human@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , it appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which has no top performance when a domain name was musi@@ cally .
how do you analyse as his biograph@@ er this final report ?
Michael H@@ emann : if you do the effort and read all over the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask themselves , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is coming to it at all .
just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspic@@ ion of the Mitt@@ al or co @-@ sponsored by the horri@@ fying cases of sexual abuse .
the arch @-@ art at the pre @-@ school took place outside of its activity .
you may choose to throw it if too late or first clari@@ fications will not be seriously treated enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cathedral at which he worked , was practically all respon@@ dents considered - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger presents a very excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very good &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; under@@ stand@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as extremely rare teachers who supplies the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority is worth over its perfec@@ tion@@ ist and its high emot@@ ion , which led to wa@@ ut@@ er@@ brü@@ ten times .
so that he cast not only with chairs and threw the keys on the floor , but also ear@@ ch@@ ases to the hair or ears , he already gave himself up even before years , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed .
however , it has to be said to be hon@@ our@@ able , such gu@@ ardi@@ ans in the fra@@ gment time , the 1960s and 1970s , were widespread , with parents , like teachers .
do you also know such bre@@ eder methods ?
of course , I think any of us who was born before 1968 .
I have also witn@@ essed that in a world @-@ world@@ ly school , a state school , also experienced .
compared to that in this report , namely in this report , the failure of sexual abuse and the awareness at the school , are the fre@@ il@@ age of Bag@@ at@@ ellen .
since it is asking that it was not more likely to do with his friend and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media fell on him .
on the Bavarian Pope , many who never understood him are still un@@ satisfactory .
but the truth is : the report of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger report in every respect !
in the media , in connection with the report on the subject of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also some processing or contribut@@ or in regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael E@@ emann : clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecrated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never tried to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the person who said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was very embar@@ rass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of sexual abuse was , and is that most victims were silent .
if they were not familiar with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then definitely did not make a choir master that would have been a certain colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do you evaluate the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen student rac@@ er &apos;s role in terms of abuse of abuse ?
Michael H@@ emann , &quot; an question@@ able student formed it : &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see any case in which he could have had experienced ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) , and could have had the respective perpet@@ rators .
I think it ... also for really ab@@ sur@@ d to accept that ... Bub@@ ble ur@@ gent or clear@@ er or even more opened , than compared to their parents , intern@@ ships , contact teachers , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - und@@ ou@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they trusted in advance and / or whose environment was confi@@ dential in the framework of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus shared by each co @-@ sponsored .
so , it cannot be accused of having taken him or brought him out .
therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name with these ir@@ respective crimes in connection , as it happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greenhouse gases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is put out in the report . &quot;
must he live with this alleg@@ ation ?
Michael E@@ emann : this is the great problem that in the coverage everything is missing and blo@@ g@@ ging to a giant mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and greenhouse gases , somewhere in the middle of the island , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly what is mis@@ use of the report .
there is a clean separately : between the pre @-@ school and the gramm@@ ar school of the cathedral @-@ atzen , between sexual abuse and awareness as well as we say once to rest .
the report inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , so from four decades , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not part of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
all the horri@@ ble test education , the cases , in which boys of sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers were sh@@ aded and mal@@ ign@@ ited , were all involved in the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ zh@@ ausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where truly sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to be ruled .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when she was already at the cathedral @-@ school school .
on the same , as the most witnesses of witnesses , the topic &quot; Pre @-@ School &quot; tab@@ u .
one was just happy to escape their escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ a@@ edi@@ an &quot; states .
what was different at the school ?
Michael H@@ emann , which was already discipline , but not dist@@ illed violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , at the conclusion of the report that &quot; many victims , the general humanity of R. estimates , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even more positive memories . &quot;
not so , the alleg@@ ation of the alleg@@ ations still remains .
yet in spite of all efforts , the report could only define two time periods in which it was reported by states on the pre @-@ school .
the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and from their predec@@ essors at a school , where he was not active and responsible , ( so the witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again until 1993 .
closed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger on the walls consistently regarding the ears ?
Michael H@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the cathedral &apos;s director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he indicates these things , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre@@ school continue to practi@@ ced the test penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in view of the risk of negative press release he recommended ur@@ gent influences .
this happened , of course , as a legal clarity , as a check @-@ in of Bavaria , had long been banned in Bavaria .
before this , they occurred in a legal gray zone , like every one knows us well .
it was too difficult for him to estimate that the suffer@@ ers might be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dram@@ at@@ ised , and where really the allowed limit was exceeded .
but it could not say , he would always have th@@ aw@@ ed .
that is not right .
it was only abolished in Bavaria in 1980 and officially abolished in Bavaria .
princip@@ ally in Gloria of Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is claimed it is un@@ fair who want to use today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards to the time of time .
how do you see this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael E@@ emann said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fall@@ u@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so the threat to evaluate today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there the princ@@ ess has already right .
but this is not true for sexual abuse , who ab@@ h@@ or in all times , and not for what was broken in the school of contra@@ dic@@ ation and violence to inno@@ cence in the past , that goes far beyond that time .
all that is terrible and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be processed .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all this had nothing to do with him .
his resources to the discipl@@ ines and punishment , so ear@@ phones and ears to draw , were widespread in the 1970s .
as a physical punishment , it was forbidden to stri@@ ve on himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his ra@@ iny day has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
came the topic of the check @-@ sentence to the language ?
Michael H@@ emann : now , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , then the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only one side roll .
nevertheless , in no way I refused to pass a strict reg@@ iment .
but this has to be said once : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the un@@ question@@ able discipline , it would hardly have been possible to form world cultural bot@@ an@@ ism of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the United States ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons alone one does not make any big singer and any success from any success , just in which area , but still discipline , passion and self @-@ overcome .
what kind of people do you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at her book ?
Michael H@@ emann is really familiar with the work on the book and beyond that I &apos;ve experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger and always looking back as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , low @-@ faith and sav@@ ory good people , from which one could not imagine that he could do something wrong .
I regularly come along with how many former Domain atzen still exists today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly visit him , reading him - he is almost blind - and him as a member of her family .
those who didn &apos;t forgive him until today , that it was strictly confi@@ d@@ ently to them , so clearly in minority .
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grat@@ eful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he always had a good , v@@ ä@@ ter@@ nal teacher - a str@@ ingent father , not able to be his - but also a lov@@ able respect to it today , to whom she still watch and honour them .
and please , once again clearly : everything that were presented to him are education methods that were then on the agenda back then .
we can be glad that we have long been overcome this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is highly un@@ just , a man because he is promin@@ ently and has a more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al fall of sin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is the evil intention which stands behind , just too .
for the report , which was just released , is dischar@@ ged on him .
now the company command would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great mer@@ its and not yet know Germany outside of Bavaria and maybe in Germany nobody would have to know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
