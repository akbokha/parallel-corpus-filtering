Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on : I will always be closed in drawers
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on does not always have to be perfect or successful .
that was the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ mis@@ under@@ stand@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always be plug@@ ged in with drawers or glued from outside label , who usually have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; hon@@ est , these things are more schn@@ u@@ ppe . &quot;
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as it explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
at the best time the actress is celebrating their time at home , front TV with lo@@ cker@@ em D@@ utt and Mexican food , called it in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to know the question of the child &apos;s request , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We must not be married or have children , to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;

gol@@ fer Lang@@ er receives the pyramid of pil@@ es
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
Bernhard Lang@@ er , born at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , visited a bit di@@ version with some colleagues on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports with the pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lang@@ er
after a couple of minutes the horses remembered her ceremony , they pursued in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home to the feed .
a kilometer at this speed , I am afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lang@@ er .
and so the horse career ends again .
on Saturday the best golf course of all times - 101 tournament victories - again in the vicinity of horses .
he left his family with his family on the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse sw@@ ath it not too photo albums .
long was the first time in Aachen and thereby also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid presented the man from An@@ hausen in the framework of a small Gala @-@ Golden Age pyramid .
there won &apos;t be hon@@ our@@ able in sympath@@ etic athletes .
Federal Minister of Cross , Silver , Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions Tour Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already warned him .
long is the 18th award winner of the pyramid of pil@@ es .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award is very much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lang@@ er , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only for spor@@ tive successes , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lang@@ er promotes the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25.000 Euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men the two @-@ fold US mast winner was added to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among others , the athletes of Hart@@ wig G@@ ien@@ ger , the Turner Eber@@ hard G@@ ien@@ ger , the F@@ iller Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ ek@@ e , the Rider of Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of handic@@ ra@@ des Erhard .
many of these sports were come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , this lively company emigrated to the Spring@@ field , where the Lav@@ azza prize ran .
Bernhard Lang@@ er held distance to the great animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ umps Business Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
in infrastructure and to prevent the Trade Agreement T@@ TP , both Clinton and Tr@@ ump are being used as well as Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential candidates are however , with tax and energy policy as well as in a basic principle .
differences in the economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , more philosoph@@ ical difference .
the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to lead the doub@@ ts rather small and war@@ ns before , as the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulation .
Clinton made the economy to death and regul@@ ate deaths , he says .
but in contrast , he would be different , cla@@ iming Tr@@ ump .
he will rest@@ ores massi@@ f massi@@ vely , and he makes himself a far more tax reform with lower tax sets strong - for private people and for businesses .
Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has made a dis@@ advant@@ ageous opportunities and needs money .
therefore , taxes for the rich man would increase , says it .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
in the m@@ ules , Tr@@ ump and Clinton will say nearly that same .
democratic applicants also announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and will be rejected by the state @-@ party Te@@ ach@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so on Tr@@ ump , so there could be part@@ isan internal discussions .
more significant are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal plants and drive the coal extraction in the USA again .
oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas to termin@@ ate the Paris@@ ian climate agreement .
with their investment program expressly aims to expand and demands : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or the Americas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to be there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , both competitors are not far from each other .
T@@ PP , the trade of civ@@ il@@ fish trade agreements , would not want to sign them .
at the same time both the United States would not want to isol@@ ate international trade - but just US jobs .
which should then be paid even better , is required by Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger wage .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump I want to do in this question is not clear : once again he says : the minimum wage has to be , then he says he will not be changed .
but the big discussion of the upcoming months is likely to develop the control policy of both bearings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on one side is Tr@@ ump , who wants to spur growth and citizens to spur growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics hold him , so that the bud@@ get@@ ary deficit would only be bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton , who want to ask at least from the rich men that they would pay more taxes , and their critics say , &quot; more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost as daily life .
if they arrive in Germany , they often are sad .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is most one year old .
she laid her little son in the arm .
he gu@@ akes with great eyes curious in the room .
his mother are star@@ red onto the table top .
until they noticed that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles and kissed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until one speaks with Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is part of the Con@@ dro@@ bs Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aid services in Bavaria , and among others , with the theme of women on the escape .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in Munich in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodation for all women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs has made up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
they have been officially opened officially .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are no - not as visitors .
the exception is a wax at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every woman who comes here , has made your flight experience with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars , because they are polit@@ ically persecuted , because killing torture or death , or because their families would send them as an hope to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women there are many other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her home , they have experience with sexual violence , anxi@@ ety , Hon@@ mor@@ ing , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
she continues her away .
the flight goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that tugs require a bottle of water for a bottle of water , no rarity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that once they are an@@ cho@@ red in Germany , ir@@ re , told B@@ ahr .
even here , women in refugee were often considered as min@@ der@@ e@@ emed and worse than mis@@ used .
this is that approximately 90 per cent of women who live in the residence in the Munich North , is traum@@ ati@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are there so much that they say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they trusted not to speak openly about that , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they are often not able to help others , there is more accommodation for them , ur@@ ges B@@ ahr .
the seven regional governments have been responsible for the placing of refugees in Bavaria .
on the question whether they w@@ ished from a similar project as in Munich in its jurisdiction of jurisdiction , some with No .
in Ober@@ p@@ fal@@ z and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is no such thing in the governments of the governments .
Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press @-@ pre@@ ver of the government , also in pregnant women alone , are not housed in pregnant women alone .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , lower and middle fran@@ ken there are stories or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament is calling for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the privacy or men are accommodated , men and women can be accommodated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence against women are coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all the rooms should be separated and accessible to women , stands in the study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much women will feel the need of this protective need to be read on the And@@ ur@@ ge , which gives it to the house in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have spoken it , we have a long qu@@ eu@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily make a second house .
assistance in Assi@@ stance : recei@@ v@@ ables according to new working amp@@ ons
Deputy Head of the assist@@ ants have called their union plans to appro@@ ve new labour measures in their disputes regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded its entire Council to appro@@ ve more working measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC had said that the ministers could have been en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed for the wor@@ ries regarding the contract .
in July , assistant @-@ denti@@ sts and medical engineers met in July about the re@@ jection of a contract that has been agreed with BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained quiet &quot; for problems , which was denied the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering that , the J@@ DC executive committee voted to fully re@@ ject the proposed new contract and calls for official re @-@ negotiations to all liber@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board announced a formal application to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a ongoing program of working work that starts at the beginning of September .
the disputes resulted in that assistance of this year , six sm@@ al prov@@ oked , the first general inci@@ dents in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A Assistant Professor Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back to the election to re@@ ject the agreed contractual conditions , which had been recommended by BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members , during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 54@@ ,000 assist@@ ants and medical engineering , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for Doc@@ tors in England would be forced into force .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of Foreign Affairs &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that finished a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce his hands and procla@@ im an official end of the eight months of war and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ part in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I cannot realize that Ankara will destroy this reconciliation .
there was the r@@ ash , yes .
but Putin was a sm@@ el@@ ly smile , and he radi@@ ated hardly heat , even for his re@@ aming conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an , on the other hand , spoke about his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friend &apos;s Friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - according to a report about five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also promised that relations with Russia could not only return to their old level prior to the crisis but even better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an would have been da@@ w@@ ed as would have been something to happen .
to me , his enthusiasm seemed to be on the contrary .
but one of Putin &apos;s be@@ aming , sustainable bol@@ le showed that the Russian head of Russia had nothing to forget .
rather the cause of the crisis was the first , what he mentioned in his introductory words : the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ alled .
Putin distributed Putin and accused Ankara , Russia in their back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was even bigger because it was committed by a divine friend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to build up again , it is difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the state @-@ controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed to bear the Turks for everything .
on serious , the accus@@ ations of conduc@@ tive civil servants had benef@@ ited that Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s own family had benef@@ ited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , who will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he fought this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg was the official message that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received his fault from the President Erd@@ og@@ an that he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of an arm@@ ist@@ ice is clear on the hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an needs first line all friends who can get , after the last month in a failed coup d &quot; coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey had also sh@@ aken him .
but there is also economic moti@@ fs .
Russian sanctions are hard to meet Turkey - especially the ban of char@@ tered per@@ fug@@ es that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has declined by nearly 90 % .
in Russia , travel operators and char@@ tered companies will be facilit@@ ated if the flights will be resumed .
they count on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght to the Mediterranean .
this week forec@@ asted the state of television cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural exports are allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is on the west , since the reaction to the attempted power of power was considered a weak response .
along with this , the continuing Gro@@ ll come across the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the er@@ p@@ out on it is to withdraw from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
in Ankara , the Russian government won a bonus that he demanded by the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat support for the selected state organs .
this is well known for Moscow to consider a self @-@ understanding , which itself has a pro@@ found fear of reg@@ im@@ ents .
the summit in this glorious palace at the sea allowed it Russia and Turkey , one that once described an analysis of an analy@@ tics , &quot; Alliance of Foreign Affairs . &quot; two countries that feel off from the west and po@@ or@@ ly treated , and now banned .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two still differences .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently delivered the role as pe@@ ac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support each other side .
it could be noted that after almost three hours of first discussions both pre@@ sidents were informed of the press conference , that they could not say the subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the president of Turkey prevented it on a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no clear con@@ sen@@ sus about it , where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of an open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster , as the NATO member Turkey shot the Russian combat jet - it certainly is better to talk about the two Heads of State at least .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland no longer available
according to the Board of Directors of the Bank , R@@ BS is supposed to be reduced to a back@@ drop @-@ roll .
Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand were linked to the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
the Bank has since been dist@@ illed since then , when they had almost collap@@ sed and saved almost eight years ago .
at this time brand , &quot; R@@ BS &quot; was used to protect other consumer financial brands .
they supported the international sport with million pounds to Spon@@ sor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to the Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she decided to move more national brands in focus .
Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and the IP@@ B references will change to Nat@@ West .
Ul@@ ster &apos;s brand is already used to customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for the private customer business that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Drum@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WA@@ N was inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he divided the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will be at our investors brand as well as the brand , among which our employees will be busy , since we are now going to become a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the bank itself has been a global brand , R@@ BS was a global brand .
I say that we don &apos;t have any global goals , but pursu@@ ing local goals .
each of these brands will work in their own communities for something completely different and our staff will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that there will be six Nations sponsor@@ ship , and that it will increase the perception of the various brands in its sport Spon@@ sor@@ ship .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop the bank of the brands , as we are concentr@@ ating on the inside ( we &apos;ve asked ) to make this for a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Board of Directors .
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think it will see many changes .
we can start again this brands , so I think that the time has come .

Russia &apos;s Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed un@@ wanted to release his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a lot of years part of the most close trust of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed special en@@ voy for environmental and transportation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is that Putin have ordered the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o who had been a deputy chairman since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn , he graduated at the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the site of Kre@@ m@@ lin it is called ( on Russian ) that it was later promoted to log @-@ head and head of the control room .
on his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important role of the government to assist your activity as chief of state of law and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked him to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
persu@@ ade the ri@@ di@@ ous faces ?
this step has made Moscow secrets .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the most close confidence Vladimir Putin and works as he for the Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff re@@ signs at his own request .
but despite the differentiation of the cameras , only few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections .
so here is the result of a sort of power ?
no one knows that .
but the official statement - that a man who was once approved as a potential president , would like to lead to the Russian environmental policy - pushed forward to big sk@@ ep@@ ti@@ c@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin , quoted on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; it is true that I asked you in a conversation , I could have to say that this very complicated - man could say nearly four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov received the post in December 2011 .
he previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the B@@ und@@ essi@@ onn@@ al Service ( FS@@ B ) , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin came to power in Ivan@@ ov , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , whom he confi@@ ded in most .
once was believed that Ivan@@ ov could lead to Putin &apos;s second term president of Russia as a third term putting Putin against the constitution .
but this item was taken by another , close allies of Put@@ ins , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister , before he became president of three and a half years later .

Que@@ ens@@ lav@@ ing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ lav@@ ings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closing of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cover &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which makes the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20.000 tons of concrete and 46 sc@@ av@@ eng@@ ths .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister K@@ eit@@ h Brown was a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to come from the country on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment of the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all the witnesses of an engineer from a truly ep@@ ic dimensions in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the sealing between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck has an hei@@ k@@ le activity that require extremely precise tolerances for the fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge to their place and the last section of the cover is today in Ros@@ y@@ th a concrete deck for the deck which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first clasp is a considerable milestone in each bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the closure of tr@@ end@@ setting high and deep construction .
following the installation of the last road@@ map and its connection with the expanding North tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or land .
this was achieved by pulling the northern part bridge 700 millimeters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very hei@@ gh@@ ty activity .
massi@@ vely , since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct 222 meters long , about 6,000 tons weighs about 6.000 tons and had to be drawn up with a gra@@ dient of about 3 % .
un@@ cle because the tolerances that the team works , tiny - at each side they were just a few millimeters .
fortunately , everything was very good .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; lucky even on life &quot;
three men were lucky to be happ@@ ily alive in the life , after they were thrown out of their fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station beat on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in safety while their boat moved out of their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat looked behind in her near , and set us the worst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately the wind b@@ lows the boat already beyond their reach , until we had ended water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhau@@ sted at the age of 60 and was discovered at a bo@@ b@@ ever without lif@@ ter .
they arrived all aboard the coastal field and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men that were thrown into the waters have good luck and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat also had a stop@@ over one , and , in the case of the p@@ ush@@ es of the bo@@ wel of the person claimed that the boat also controlled .
someone told me today about these men .
hard injured - man st@@ out on his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend
a man attacked his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and bad@@ ly injured .
as the police divided yesterday , the 50 year old had received the key to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead , the soft offen@@ ders cut the clothes of his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend .
when they came into the apartment , he twice upon them .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured on the hand and on the body .
the police could take the offen@@ ders .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend , he called his mother .
this al@@ im@@ pover@@ ished then his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother .
but they could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went with her compan@@ ions out of the house .
on the road they met the former partner of the man .
when the two women called the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old has his sister to the side and handle his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend .
who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ gs budget apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Green Party said to my : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors are to be stronger stronger than the duty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how to react to the bad news that Braunschweig in the next few years will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; hand @-@ concept housing &quot; to the next meeting .
yet strife is programmed .
primarily , the question arises : who should actually build the inexpensive apartments ?
a provision is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD faction leader Christoph Brat@@ mann said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to build us by gre@@ enery : who wants to build an urban areas in future 20 percent of all apartments as social dwellings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the affordable apartments can also arise in the inventory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the big forces of the town hall , however , is such a viola : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you want to build to private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build investors on such areas at least 10 percent , but as possible as 20 percent of apartments as social dwellings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new municipal housing project , which will cost millions of cost and will be financed for inc@@ enti@@ ment .
the problem , such as this : &quot; there is currently no agreement between fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make investors as much as possible .
the Lin@@ ke wants to add hardness levels for investors .
regardless of his , this fr@@ ying had a mer@@ ges of the situation on the housing market .
the manual concept is implemented , providing additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we get skilled workers .
but still the program is not complete : for the approximately 1260 new apartments , which should be built @-@ in .
how to compens@@ ate the loss of some 1300 favorable flats , whose funding is going to run in the next few years ?
by 2020 , it will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the plann@@ er spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be purchased out of the city now .
Moreover , it would have to be thought about that flats again to get back into the price @-@ up .
this is possible in the western city .
to a blow , the problem is solved .
because in the western city there are at the end of the year at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could get there back into the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this is the owner , the housing companies not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the number of social dwellings in the western city has been dra@@ stically increased , you will be removed from the goal of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flow@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no longer a concentration of social weak in just a few neighbour@@ hoods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green Party expect that it will still be moving in discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Quest@@ ionn@@ aire Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority the CD@@ U must be equipped with the boat &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the have concentrated on more buildings for family homes .
but what does not mean that yet another compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing to see how the world changes .
that te@@ ens and child to play no longer go beyond , but rather prefer to spend their free time , on screens , in the last decade of many be@@ compl@@ ains .
when Pok@@ em@@ on Go go therefore to get people from the sofa and get more active .
at the beginning of the screen the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and last on smartphones .
therefore it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities open not towards each other .
I speak of course of course on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters initially created for vide@@ og@@ ging in the 1990s ( later it emerged from a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture fell to the interest in front of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries has been post@@ pon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users as an inks and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; in short , the player with their smartphone search outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , which are tra@@ ced with a GPS , and once they were found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( about a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ ump@@ ed for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the USA , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that returns the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; per day &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cardi@@ ff , an app for Apple Watch , which followed 35,000 users , told that within two days of market launch of the game , the number of down@@ wards followed people who j@@ ump@@ ed from 45 percent to 53 percent every day .
the company does not know who plays of that Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it is just the cru@@ de data for the performance increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public educational programmes for health , people want to bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to come from the sofa , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop to be deaf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop to be deaf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because many public messages are bor@@ ing to health and coming from people who look forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be evaluated .
those who drives regularly sports , reducing its chances to ill cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages which is too long to use them here .
but the wonder of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that there is people to do something in the open , that fun makes fun .
thus , three columns of the health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun .
some people close the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
as always there is m@@ ür@@ rical toys , which have to always be chargeable about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should I do ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit already started our activity , they gave us no reason to drive sport , how it does this game .
the New will lose its stim@@ ulus , and the use will be treated with the time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the poker success , there will be more games , the apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will help many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in ladies
forget the print .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all that immune .
dynamic on the spr@@ ing@@ horse .
effort@@ lessly on the bar .
stun@@ n@@ ingly on the floor .
on the whole line brilliant .
and now , Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to multiple campaigns and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes with the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
the overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly before the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team kam@@ er@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ em@@ el@@ ail@@ len@@ ess in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ neth on the Swe@@ des during the single multi @-@ battle for women in the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multi @-@ campaign titles and a total of the fifth , while they fixed their reputation , the best of its generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears , when their final result was shown and her long trip took place in that moment .
it succe@@ eds in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps , who brought their sports types to new heights :
Bil@@ es dominated the last three years her sports art domin@@ ating , 15 world leaders - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises , who said the Olympic Champion of 1984 Mary L@@ ou Ret@@ ton , said that she has ever seen &quot; the best gymn@@ ast , which I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was expecting a last test in Brazil , a competition which was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not to return with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered a dis@@ appointment .
the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , after they have won gold and silver in the single multilingual network of women in the summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ es took the first medal at Tuesday while on the f@@ arewell party , Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi served as a sign of retirement .
even though they existed on the top , during their long way to the top , never the future is planned , isn &apos;t it true .
a part of its floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Passport - is located at Latin American music , that &apos;s home on the road outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a co@@ incidence .
this girl , adopted by their grand@@ parents as a small child , and by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother was discovered during a school trip to the gym , in the Bo@@ or@@ man trained , was used for strength .
since the summer of 2013 , she has not lost the competition competition more , a winning stre@@ ak , which is so long as it wishes it .
even when Must@@ af@@ ina led slightly by two rot@@ ations , the image carried out .
Swe@@ des and Bo@@ erg@@ ur@@ nen - in which Bil@@ es keeps the world title - lau@@ ched .
she recovered again with 15,@@ 433 on the p@@ ig @-@ bar again - and sat down with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man im@@ pover@@ ished her gently as she expected their end to their end - a pure form - and tears at Bil@@ es glossy red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , when the vision was described in her collective book , to reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago , when they fought for the third place , but the bronze wa@@ ist in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke at Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team capit@@ als presented by the Americans &quot; O@@ ma &quot; is a ledge .
after its ground practice , they threw the audience of K@@ us@@ sh@@ ines , who sometimes appeared doub@@ t@@ ful of a com@@ eback .
as a matter of image , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old T@@ we@@ et has a very new meaning that the 19 @-@ year olds of the early week has a very new meaning :
police : 3 victims in series , shot during music and listening in the car
according to the police report , which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl shot dead in one of the most serious attacks in the first series of series by Phoenix , while sitting in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah was shot on 12 June , while car was par@@ ked by car , the authorities said .
the cul@@ tured eight shots from a hand @-@ fire weapon , during which he stood on the passenger side of the car , and fled with another vehicle , can be read in the report .
the police declared that the triple murder was not to be the result of a cra@@ wler , since the attack@@ ers did not take the hand@@ bags , or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who found himself in possession of an adult victims .
by Phoenix S@@ g@@ s. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of the investig@@ ator has led the investig@@ ator to be linked to the investigation , if it is connected with four previous attacks .
in total , seven persons were killed and two others were injured in h@@ isp@@ anic residential neighbor@@ hoods within four months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , the beginning of the month with . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investigations refused to reveal the evidence that they have been linked to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised in due to their injuries and passed away later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness that was not unusual for them , that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ qu@@ est car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which resulted in an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the series .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ ro@@ ses and secured a ball out of the seat and ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and naturally his mother .
but as the least of his aging , Edmund Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , did not know about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought , I made it not .
I do not create this .
I didn &apos;t let me leave .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right - of course one has left it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her husband was told that Edmund will never be able to recognize them under circumstances , and that he may not survive .
some doctors went even so far that they beat him to be institutional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Edmund can run with the help of a obe@@ dient .
Edmund could neither cra@@ w@@ ling nor ro@@ b up to his third year old , and he cannot speak yet .
but he makes slow progress .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and singing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth is the drawing language that Edmund for &quot; Please sing me something before &quot; pronoun@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; we bring it to him drawing language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is no typical character language -- says she . Edmund has invented some signs alone .
Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y has a multitude of causes : genetic as in Edmund , as well as infections with viruses such as Mas@@ kers or the z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
symptoms and projec@@ tions may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how to influence the life of the z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus In@@ infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional prize of an un@@ certain future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and it doesn &apos;t know it .
I have no longer asked for the forecast for a long time because I don &apos;t expect that someone can really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has created a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of mamm@@ al with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it will get better .
you know that it will get better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

Ste@@ ele said that alone the Municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa should have had ten thousand sand@@ bags .

H@@ ans@@ ford told that he and his family members had all disabilities , and he was the only one that can swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ e@@ pers would have been saved all three in a large military truck , and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood had spread themselves quickly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since there were still heavy rainf@@ alls , so that the authorities evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the police divi@@ des that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week is already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as a Mah@@ aj Brown .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his little body was pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the state of the boy was classified as a critical hospital , and he had to under@@ gone several operations .
the family of the boys divided the transmitter that it is expected to be again .
he would like to begin the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were assembled in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two aged 29 and a 32 @-@ year old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in the critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in a stable condition .

the other two victims were not found in the car and the police had just been determined , whether at one of the last men of the offen@@ ders could be found .
investig@@ ators ordered C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to be a cruci@@ f@@ euer between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
pat@@ ron@@ ro@@ ses for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which have been tra@@ cked to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , out@@ ages the facts .
it seems that it clearly seems to have a continuous struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the walking distance , sleeve .
so there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active here , &quot; divided police officer Anthony G@@ inal@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter .
several houses and vehicles were met in the territory .
there was no fixed measures and the police have examined repor@@ tedly reports the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 year old girl was hit by a cross sl@@ ay@@ er at the arm , when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane .
she recovered and the police is still looking for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I &apos;m taking part in the women &apos;s Olympic Centre and this is more than a reason .
I &apos;ve been doing so much for the summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant .
and second : this team has three tower , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , which is Roman Cath@@ o@@ kin , makes everyone proud .
the USA finally reflects the US .
it has the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of these sports art .
in the past four years the number one was one of the female gymn@@ ast a A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year there were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this is showing strength .
in the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner in the Americas .
now the world was able to be a witness of incredible performance of the three times world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as it was unexpected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ic@@ rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won with an individual training event for women gold .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won Silver .
we will see the top of this sport , but you don &apos;t see turn@@ able classes in all the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five &quot; because the next Olympics is only four gymn@@ asts in the team . Moreover , that is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer .
but the reality is so that Tur@@ ns is an expensive sport and Turner first place in private gy@@ ms that will maintain their parents , education , travel and hotel costs ( for the trainer and their Turner and families ) . the list can be adjusted to the list .
the majority of these s@@ orts are in we@@ al@@ thy suburbs , which can support business .
in these cases , Turner will receive their entire training and this is a commitment and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both their athletes trained since they started with the tower .
we have to insp@@ ire the municipalities of Au@@ n , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an impressive and easier access to access .
I founded my Turn@@ Foundation for 20 years .
with my events we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ asts in Harlem for about 15.000 people ( mostly black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to provide high @-@ quality gymn@@ asts ensuring the possibility to earn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
developed strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the spirit .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that thousands of young girls can bring to the gymn@@ asts and that &apos;s great .
it &apos;s so important to participate in sport , especially for girls .
this is so exciting time .
thanks to Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thanks , F@@ ass you motiv@@ ates her way to start healthy , strong and successful young women .

the Minister had hop@@ ing to end the dispute over the changes caused by the adoption of a re@@ formed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assist@@ ants , who voted in an election to vote .

efforts made by the BM@@ A to resol@@ ve the disputes arising from discussions with discussions on re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ance and sometimes to de@@ af@@ ening silence .
that happened to the one that Jeremy Hunt had made it the last month , that his door would always be obvious .
&quot; Jeremy Hunt must now act , en@@ for@@ cing the for@@ cing and wor@@ ries of the assistant . &quot;
if he do not do this , it did not have the assist@@ ants well , that they are ready to conduct further labor measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a slot of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates before , as n@@ urses and specialized doctors were involved in order to grant doctors on the string de@@ mark .

the BM@@ A wants to be a better week re@@ mun@@ eration for the 54@@ ,000 assist@@ ants that are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ ning , Director General of N@@ HS employees , demanded the assistant to termin@@ ate the strike .
Mor@@ ning said : &quot; working amp@@ f@@ le measures nothing of the only little , but already super@@ charged teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nour@@ ishing and their families just wor@@ ries , distress , and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
during the past two months , we talked to me with the help of the assist@@ ants , and with the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries to the concerns relating to the prec@@ urs@@ or and of the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employer hop@@ ed that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - how to return , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of apprenti@@ ce , training events and gender @-@ specific wage works in medicine - a sign that was the employer , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .

culture of Political Cor@@ ri@@ ness lets election campaign to flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on for Rah@@ man was removed last year for corruption of a government report on corruption of the ministry
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a culture of Political Cor@@ ri@@ ness has led that far more widespread elec@@ toral population in Muslim congregations will be ig@@ no@@ red as a devastating government report today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es ri@@ pen@@ ed the police , elec@@ toral , and Rath@@ en@@ houses in order to ign@@ ore evidence of voting abuse due to &quot; survival of eth@@ no and religion . &quot;
the former minister for integration and municipal government , which is now a Ant@@ cor@@ rup@@ tion@@ sk@@ ö@@ nig , said that the power of voters from religious moti@@ ves is so bad that the police should be allowed to establish shut@@ ters outside of elec@@ ts in order to protect mig@@ rant voters .
he recommends that voters should be able to prove their identity in order to prove their identity .
at the moment , a voters must call only his name and address .
the report suggests , not removable ink on the finger of a person when they vote their elec@@ toral votes to prevent someone &apos;s twice .
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , Sir Eric says .
he demands that the press should have access to municipal documents and decisions of un@@ official comp@@ tees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only toward the election , but also the municipal government should also protect the broad@@ caster corruption and financial advisor to protect the government , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by the Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Choice of election as in the east of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the animal mayor for Rah@@ man should be upon a lit@@ igation of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community , &quot; and that he had brought his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ op@@ hob@@ ic acid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have led his campaign on the basis that it is the imp@@ lic@@ ous duty of Muslims to elect him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either doubt or the result of a re@@ spiration , if one person has chosen others .
Sir Eric said that it would be in the whole country of deceit .
he expressed in particular al@@ ar@@ ming on the fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent post@@ age stamp - when the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people , choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to clean the elec@@ toral system , including the fo@@ al of evidence to prove the identity
in his report it means : &quot; as a proof that pressure on anti @-@ needy members were exercis@@ ed , especially women and young people to choose according to the will of the El@@ der , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ dic or ban@@ quet @-@ background .
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions such as such behavior was ig@@ no@@ red because of &quot; polit@@ ically correct &quot; awareness of eth@@ no@@ ises and religion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke to 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists indicate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reap &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May , is required to prevent the har@@ der registration verification to prevent the elec@@ toral directory of immigration and social bet@@ s .
options in view , voters will be able to ask for your identification before the election .
do not use remove ink on the finger of a person as soon as they have delivered their voice to prevent any one sel@@ ects twice .
systematic transfer tests on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are entitled to claim .
a three @-@ year limitation on mot@@ ions to an automatic post@@ age code .
prohibition that political activists will process full letters and env@@ elop@@ es from the elections .
the police give the powers to al@@ ign ab@@ outs around the constitu@@ ents .
a law change that facilitates a charge of in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Represent@@ ative Act 1983 ) .
photographer for@@ b@@ ade in constitu@@ ents .
requirement that only English are used in the elec@@ toral stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training to ensure that the staff rule the rule , that voters are going to enter alone in the campaign .
Sir Eric falls on Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets no penalty was given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ toral Court has Lut@@ on for Rah@@ man and his deputy for lack of corruption and illegal practitioners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was noted due to a number of reasons for adequate , according to the high demands on the criminal proceedings - guilty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he critic@@ ises the effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ controls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the constitu@@ encies of the Town H@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets from the last year was a warning signal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country carries a proud legacy as the mother of par@@ liam@@ ents , yet the concern and spread of elec@@ toral , and void of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

fans of the Olympic Games 2016 in Rio are this week about the French Rad@@ athl@@ ete Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except edge and band , who has proven itself as an impressive double @-@ story of the Du@@ chy of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic champion in this summer is far not the only one who fought gold f@@ ath@@ ing Ath@@ let , who is at least not his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least , if one must give the social media of faith .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous Fac@@ es , which have created on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL produced a lists of Olymp@@ ians who have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood &apos;s famous times .
h@@ unters and Wolf : team member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood
apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the Rad@@ ren@@ n@@ bahn there are many people on the internet , as a certain arch@@ e@@ pers of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused an ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter after pictures , on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star in secret .
in fact , the she@@ et@@ aker got the mad@@ ness in the social media and gave it to hear that he looks back to his childhood , how he looks like Leo .
&quot; I myself see no big simil@@ arity , with the exception of facial hair@@ y , &quot; divided Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good guy , so I hate it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular settlements since London 2012 will be und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly more into the center : the atten@@ tive simil@@ arity between the UK &apos;s Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular Ac@@ tor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its big , expres@@ sive eyes is supposed to go through the Cuban American singer Gloria E@@ ste@@ fan .
and in the swimming pool , the South African S@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison since years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one gear higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athlet@@ ic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the actors &quot; &quot; &quot;
a further attempt was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hard@@ ly , who has similarly heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver med@@ alli@@ ons in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sunny skin and bl@@ on@@ ary hair as the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the Americans was test@@ ized by fans , a &quot; athlet@@ ic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar visual form and eyes
not the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy about that other simil@@ ar@@ ities are also fallen
set the space in the room : according to this user there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in declared their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet remember that hope solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the U.S. soccer star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter has an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to the actress Laura Lin@@ ney , and the gold med@@ alli@@ sts in the Tur@@ k Gab@@ by Douglas , which resem@@ bles her own wonderful , wide smile that resem@@ bles that of Bring It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

the buyer did not know where they should see , when a woman went their clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try under@@ p@@ ants .

&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the retail space , she took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants from the out@@ lay , moved their own tr@@ ump tro@@ users and tro@@ users , and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t try to find a little discre@@ et place to do it - she was just as Oskar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a in front of arms
the world outside is a dangerous location but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a little more secure .
we talked with Rh@@ one Miz@@ pe@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to move around armed women along the distance .
regardless of whether one gets you from the front or behind them , this video will show you how you turn around the sk@@ ewer .
if you att@@ aching to you from behind , then you should see your att@@ acker , so that you can see your att@@ acker , &quot; says Miz@@ pe@@ chi .
take the weapon between your front arm and shoulder before you beat the face with your free el@@ bow .
beat him so with the k@@ nee in the strip and turn your weapon before pain , the weapon of his hands . beat him on the face and move towards him while they set the weapon on him .
when you reach from the front , technology is similar to moving your body from the line , take the weapon and rotate it , so the attack@@ ers cannot shoot .
keep at the same time the weight on the weapon and beat the attack@@ ers on the chest , then turn the weapon from his handle , before it move back@@ ward and set the weapon on him .
sounds difficult ?

Travel@@ er Ian Wright sch@@ t for a guide of his tongue at the most beautiful places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller contrac@@ ted the immune system and wor@@ ship@@ pers of a serious test - le@@ aked some of the most tasty and most popular places in Europe .
the Moder@@ ator and Travel Guide Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ olk will turn right on a Euro bill , a ban@@ ist@@ ers at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a pur@@ ge button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system .
before the passing of each object he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he will be addressed .
but the experiment done under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results in daylight .
the thought , cra@@ w@@ ing the r@@ ins@@ ing of a draw toilet , which was already used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ uted , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen .
on his journey through Europe Mr Wright with doctors and medical professionals said about the promotion of intest@@ inal bacter@@ ias as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing left nothing , more than a bad fri@@ gh@@ ack in the mouth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of its gut by the world travelled through the world , and ate as well as wonderful things . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from public funds to railway stations up to dish@@ washers from toilets , the task presented his immune system definitely under a sample
in the film he told : &quot; already as a kid I was relatively un@@ wor@@ ried about what my health concerns and I have put all things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and s@@ lu@@ dge . &quot;
in the movie , he became his call to everyone .
the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its propor@@ tions showed a l@@ umin@@ omet@@ rics number of more than 4000 units .
in comparison , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ rics number is fresh washed hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to refuse after their l@@ umin@@ omet@@ rics number over 4000 units , while fresh@@ ly washed hands have a reduced of less than 60 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which shows the number of bacter@@ ias in different places such as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the worst thing that I spoke in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are nothing more dirt than that !
I &apos;m going on here nothing , because there is in@@ doors here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Vali@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company equ@@ ips Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illi and vitamin C and D in order to support the funding of intest@@ inal bacter@@ ias and the immune system .
validation Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to really offer the consumer consumers really something new .
something that is fascinating to look at the time and at the same time the benefits of Pro@@ biotics explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we performed crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings through which we finished &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ace asked us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that interest in intest@@ inal health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of only about the products we wanted to speak in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of the intest@@ inal health and as it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in the intest@@ inal health is a global phenomenon , and with the documentary , we were able to provide more information on an interesting way for more information .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ or !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direction of the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tast@@ ed some of the things I had directed to him as the ek@@ el@@ ty Russian toilet which will be shown in the movie &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , there were things that it was simple to bring Ian along with them , and others , where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we have recorded some of these beautiful le@@ gr@@ ill@@ eries on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in one of the survey carried out in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents were related to the well@@ being of Ma@@ gen and Dar@@ m and 58 percent , that they should occasionally use occasionally products that they include both Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illi .
the social family destroyed before del@@ og@@ ation social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a as@@ oci@@ ous family left their social apartment after a delay with a loss of £ 50,000 because they had begun their neigh@@ bors .
Tan@@ ya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after having been removed from their property , sho@@ cked employees of the housing estate found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls illuminated cr@@ ush holes , wood di@@ ps have been torn , rub@@ b@@ ish has been decorated on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated on walls .
the family were settled and it is believed that they now lives in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it fears no more to repair the apartment .
she said : &quot; there was an absolute night@@ mare , and I &apos;m the view that people must not live in this way .
there are many things to consider because this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ ori@@ ous and her reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , the meantime lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror which the family had added , street strug@@ gles with bas@@ eball , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking , drug traff@@ icking , drug traff@@ icking , drugs and floods .
sk@@ el@@ sk@@ el@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an arrangement for anti @-@ potential behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which will be torn down under circumstances , old gar@@ bage was found
it were done in the estate where in which the past drugs were tra@@ pped , the wood ri@@ mp@@ s were torn
neigh@@ bors said that they had to fight them on the road and had to be called the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ed her and her partner this week for@@ ci@@ ble from the estate , after they gave them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntary redund@@ ant .
the del@@ og@@ ation of ligh@@ tened neigh@@ bors were sh@@ aken , saying that her life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood there , because it was so quiet - that &apos;s we stayed there !
now , where they &apos;re finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ ang@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that the family was administered to co @-@ operate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called in regular intervals , 20 years long .
on the over@@ threw side of the congregation , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were cast down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant re@@ ed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , as a delay is always the last step where Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing is taking into consideration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case since the behaviour was extremely difficult , and their deeds had to be terrible to their neighbours .
I guess all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the church , we have addressed to us and have made us the information .
I hope that this development is giving to some neigh@@ bors , and the message is convey@@ ed that ant@@ iso@@ y behavior is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons have lived at different times in the house , but they all be about 20 .
a dirty mattress included in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delay on the ground
workers of the house administration are now surrounded by land@@ mines , which are surrounded by the house
in 2014 , the police led a raid in the house and found about 70@@ g cannabis as well as orph@@ ans , par@@ ap@@ her@@ al@@ ies and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
sk@@ el@@ sk@@ el@@ don received a fine , after being found guilty of ownership of a Class B drug in a merchant view .
she claimed that money was a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came in 2013 with a car accident .
after they were without hom@@ eless , Tan@@ ya and her partner now live in a private accommodation at Pl@@ ymouth .
many rooms walls of the house were coated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police said that she will del@@ og@@ ging Mi@@ eter , who will not keep the order of the house
Angela Cro@@ w , from the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall told that the Del@@ og@@ ation is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants which will not keep the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes on those who have been dr@@ unken without self @-@ sel@@ enium , as well as those who have been off@@ ended by such a behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate the social and anti @-@ potential behaviour that continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

the spokes@@ man said that the jet , due to the poor view of the poor view , a little deeper than usual , however , the air forces continued to risk that safety at any time was endangered .
area fires have destroyed this summer parts of the Portuguese complex , where four people came to death on the island of Madeira .

the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday in a single finale to his Land@@ smann and &quot; defender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,4 ) .

last non @-@ Chinese on the upper@@ most Olympia @-@ Tre@@ pp@@ le was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ leg@@ ion@@ ary ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang stand alone on the plate only , between the movements and in time @-@ outs they had no co@@ aches .
they moved back to the triumph@@ s and left their sc@@ anners in the fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mat until now I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I &apos;m going to say to me , Z@@ hang came together . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game &apos;s pos@@ ing gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly .
Ma had really strug@@ gled with his 28 @-@ year opponent only in the first movement .

Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ ranked ″ massive problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditional conservative states with their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump gave now weak@@ nesses of his elec@@ toral campaign in the previous Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Utah .
a rare moment , in which the usually large track and self @-@ alig@@ ned Mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire , something like concerns expressed as correspon@@ dent , reported as correspon@@ dent .
after 16 rival within the own Republi@@ can camp from the race , the doub@@ ts now grow at his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; we have tremend@@ ous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump into evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in key states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
the gu@@ ilt of false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resumed his well @-@ known media reports .
republi@@ can flood ru@@ bur@@ ns
Utah normally is a safe bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ or United States in June according to Tr@@ ump and his competitors from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton at the same time .
other institutions see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that are common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state of state .
as vulner@@ able , Arizona and Georgia are considered to be endangered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump on the question as he would stop the advance of Clin@@ t , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as I did so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and whether behind her : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is doing nothing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not successful for him on the end for the reasons of political correc@@ t@@ ness , it is OK , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Party Tr@@ ump is supposed to submit funds to support its elec@@ toral campaign , it should not be able to present a better conversion value .
instead of what would you need to take the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans for Congress stronger under the arms .
Olympia : Dre@@ ister Sc@@ am at D@@ oping test
the IOC wants to set a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ commission in the event .
Kenya &apos;s athl@@ ete threat@@ ens after the second doping aff@@ air during the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
in Kenya , Kenya has sent a coach home with a D@@ oping control in the Olympic village .
the International Olympic Committee distributed to setting up a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ commission to investigate the case .
a ken@@ ian function had informed that the former Sprinter and today Coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ Lev@@ ite Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i submitted .
this is reported that the team of Ken@@ yan has been reported by D@@ oping @-@ Controller .
the IA@@ AF world association has searched for information on the case to strict its investigations , an IA@@ AF speakers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures of the IOC the IA@@ AF will take an evaluation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was called the IA@@ AF Declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to D@@ oping control station and signed as Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , the sample signed and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken@@ yan chief de Mission Stephan ar@@ ap So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of athletes , which stood on the list for training controls in the world &apos;s anti @-@ D@@ oping agency .
Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i became 2015 in Beijing World Cup @-@ fourth over 800 meters .

according to media reports , he was alleged to be arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi .
Kenya has already been under special observation for the IOC in the IOC after a long time period .
when the announcement of the IOC I used more than 2000 di@@ oping target controls before the Rio Olympics , it did not be pointed out that particularly athletes of Kenya and Russia will be taken into the visor .
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exercis@@ ed much pressure on the African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ doping law and a functional control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympia @-@ Start .
as a consequence , the WA@@ DA Kenya took place from the list of countries whose D@@ oping @-@ fighting action with the rules of WA@@ DA are .
Kenya is considered as a big runner @-@ up .
the athletes of the country won most medals in Beijing at the 2015 World Cup .
in a series of television reports of the ARD , ARD were continually increased again that in Kenya D@@ oping funds are easily accessible and there is a significant ment@@ ality of the sport .
IOC member Richard Po@@ und asked for a similar examination in Kenya , as he had asked them in the Russian athlet@@ ics stadium .
it could be proved that in this sport @-@ type area and systematic d@@ op@@ t was proved .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer .

I would say that we really have this girl in our blood !
in this occup@@ y , Bart@@ oli plays an older of Mary .
she re@@ members her beloved with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dance .
the role of Mary has always fascin@@ ated me .
first , because she is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then Mari@@ as Person@@ ality would be .
she says it in her song : &quot; I enjoyable pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I enjoyable pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so it is smart , of course also n@@ ai@@ v , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character which I have as Romans in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Battle Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

she is a tremend@@ ous human being .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ments : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is so an extraordinary artist and passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a need for him .
you see it in each of his moves , in his eyes , it &apos;s his life !
it &apos;s like a huge opportunity to share these musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion , and also a cheer@@ ful approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , we did the refugees that went back to New York at that time , and the New York residents didn &apos;t want to inhabitants .
the same subjects are the same subjects , and they are equally identical like that .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ oned with tens of thousands of protective g@@ ob@@ seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime continues fighting the min@@ orities and democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the leader of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die Welt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had already passed up@@ heav@@ es with criminal cases , 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey had to escape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the failed coup , some se@@ cular and op@@ positi@@ onal ethnic Turks are added .
many will begin to begin in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state who takes refugees to refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of Staff compl@@ ained the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab Arab@@ s in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ ev@@ it@@ alian cities .
in order to increase Erd@@ og@@ an to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were cut off in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who also has CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s head demanded that the federal government positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and his supp@@ orters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also in Germany , a &quot; hex@@ ag@@ hunt &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an critics have been held .
I feel no longer in Germany last months for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , mainly Kur@@ ds and opposition .
the fire mark as well as Gü@@ len is destroyed teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not fit and Erd@@ og@@ an who sits on the pack@@ ers , by the way the Kem@@ alists and sow@@ ing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dialogue and Education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper reports on appeal on figures for the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks had already recognized the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers in Germany because of political persecution .
as at the reporting date June 30 , this 11.@@ 386 people and this means that almost 29 percent of all as@@ yl@@ ates have been acknowledged ( 3@@ 9.@@ 625 ) .
in this survey , they don &apos;t find that before war , poverty or Per@@ c@@ tiv@@ el@@ ess@@ ness .
asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are exclusively polit@@ ically , so by state @-@ of @-@ law .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go where it is we@@ aving &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the loc@@ als get nothing from summer campaign with - and the holiday in North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country .
they understood in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
by 2021 , the Parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the sever@@ ity of parliament approved the beginning of the year .
as a result , it is not so far off : summer holidays , heat , and land meals - that f@@ ails .
the loc@@ als , which are to be convinced by the election , are on holiday .
most of those vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are no loc@@ als , so no loc@@ als are allowed to choose the country .
there are practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , posters hang up , air bal@@ lo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , and out at the end of the vote , only tired should be filled .
by September 4 , 2016 , the election and last Feri@@ h@@ y , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to be just over the people over the past .
the hot stage , if one can say at all , has just started .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his ministry .
the SPD , since 1998 , is the strongest party , is now in pol@@ ls clearly behind the CD@@ U .
exciting is exciting how bad@@ ly new@@ com@@ ing Af@@ ak cuts and what remains left at the end of Ko@@ al@@ ar@@ ous@@ al .
S@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 , head of head , makes an almost in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous turn@@ out campaign , one can see from his grand@@ parents .
he travels across the land , spread ro@@ ses and pl@@ au@@ rus a little with the people , as it did already like his legendary wor@@ t@@ ing@@ ing predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , sail@@ ors will receive cold feet , and Chancellor Merkel &apos;s gu@@ ilt on the bl@@ oss@@ om of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your refugee policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create the asc@@ ension of the sp@@ uli@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is probably now probably the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with their nickn@@ ame , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced , as it is , when you make a wrong place at the right place .
she invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large exploration and Angela Merkel in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree with more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as the Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accused Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary @-@ General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is also no one to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , Angela Merkel .
otherwise the North Rhine @-@ CD@@ U does not reno@@ un@@ ces the usual election distances on market places and m@@ alls with sun umbre@@ l@@ las and air bal@@ lo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minor role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union also noted that you would think on the country that it must be very severe , to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are like the left , the SPD , the Green Party : hardly available in the country of the country .
however , the Council of the CD@@ U elec@@ ast is also self @-@ dischar@@ ging : &quot; they must go where it aw@@ akes , namely where men are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden wedding , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much on the game , Sell@@ ering has called for its SPD now to a particularly committed campaign .
in pol@@ ls , the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind the CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the 2011 election , the SPD won still clear with 3@@ 5.6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Green Party , a small party with seven percent in the surveys , do the jump into the country .
they make out of the holidays of ad@@ versity a modern pocket and lay out its elec@@ toral struggle .
&quot; online campaign &quot; is called Claudia Müller &apos;s state @-@ president Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green elec@@ trop@@ hi@@ jack@@ er give himself to trace refuge after native women among the holiday .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the nickn@@ ame , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a house@@ boat by the Mecklenburg Lake lakes and there is also beautiful .
your impression : &quot; election holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 Re@@ furb@@ ishment : guest sites suffer from blocking
on the speed , with which the B 27 is renovated , there is nothing to treat .
the manager of the construction work which begin at 5.@@ 30 am in the morning , and only at 20 o &apos;clock in the morning , there are praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we made everything fairly well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a superb team .
there is no delay .
at the beginning of October , the construction site was scheduled to be transferred to the south , until the end of October , everything will be finished .
blessed is also the being responsible for the construction of the construction work , approximately if it comes to the establishment of accommodation drives .
since the construction site is on Monday to the south , and the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has also been relaxed , the traffic situation is relaxed within the place .
the citizens can now run from O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the refuse traffic by the place seems to be back .
&quot; there were partially considerable complaints , &quot; says that responsible for the per@@ fusion management of the rehabilitation manager Florian King .
the inhabit@@ ant of Bach &apos;s Road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many sh@@ ak@@ ways sought and rather than their Nav@@ i trusted than the signs .
what led to some man@@ ners in the areas of residential areas .
since the speed limit@@ ers have not been observed , the municipality ampli@@ fies the measuring car from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable trans@@ itions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself a spot on the location . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have already been lit@@ eral .
the quick@@ est speed was on the way at 77 km / h in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
but since the construction site has been moved , but it became qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg now the road is open again .
business@@ men can not be seen in the maps .
but that the B 27 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Re@@ furb@@ ishing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the B 27 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Re@@ furb@@ ishing to Str@@ eng@@ age in Sales , everyone who asks you to look . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but some more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end @-@ customers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; thus for other firms , hardly have the restoration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Mai@@ er &apos;s Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er says Thomas Sul@@ z from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most light decline , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he dre@@ amed that of course , it is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the most dist@@ ressed are the local road along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
not only him but all restaurants have it &quot; hard hit . &quot;
we were missing the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we have to be glad about every euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sales entry was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; street people have thrown his operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to put away half of his staff .
if I have had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , government plans Jörg Schmidt on a request of G@@ öh@@ ner , whether it might give an financial compensation , the guest room benef@@ ited otherwise from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now , they also have the dis@@ advantages to carry out by the restoration .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where something is so generous .
in all cases , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
finally , the family business already exists since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history .
it is possible to understand that other Stamm@@ ga@@ este have often been f@@ atten@@ ed because of the complicated traffic management of less frequently .
if one can not drive , it is also somewhere .
that his ancest@@ or cli@@ ent@@ ele returned to the end of the rehabilitation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the cr@@ ises of BSE and a bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner keeps the effects of the B 27 construction on his customer for the biggest crisis that has experienced its host in their long history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
in the name of the terrorist attack on law , the terrorist attack is weak@@ ened in law .
according to recent announ@@ cements , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick security package .
but what has a Dul@@ ce Status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the conc@@ iler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all its suggestions have to be polit@@ ically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; polit@@ ician &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Internal Affairs at the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim no claim .
others , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
also I share myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister of Internal Affairs , it is situated to him and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commercial con@@ sen@@ sus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , a little time , before being presented his conclusions for safety in the republic .
but they now fall so many more extensive .
a lot is already known , announced that a new security authority to take care of the cra@@ ck @-@ out communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passengers and arms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is not surprising as well .
in the part of Mai@@ zi@@ ère , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second attempt on proposals to date with the SPD : it wants to put the sympath@@ izers for terrorist groups with double citizenship and kno@@ b with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; the CD@@ U guy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he can still hold this yet for reasonable and demand nothing at the business partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few new ideas present de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are partly in themselves : he plans fast procedure for sliding and more possibilities to maintain human beings from deportation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees who are targeted specifically to the country should check out their smartphones and check social media accounts for security checks .
in the Dul@@ ce for asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some more worse than so far - about such that off@@ ences will go away or throw away their papers to fail their identity .
some of them is polit@@ ically and legally registered .
man@@ ches even works un@@ balanced and can be asked questions .
and at some points - in the im@@ pet@@ us of thought for instance , the question arises : what does it actually mean to do with safety and terror ?
Yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it &apos;s important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror .
but it can &apos;t be in conclusion that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
many people in view of the high refugee numbers are wor@@ ried about safety .
and things that were in deep@@ est the people , let not let rest in the campaign of campaigns .
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the contamination is large .
and yes , there are elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Union and Social Democratic Party are therefore increasing with the theme of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past few days , there went up between the two parties .
only a gar@@ ris@@ ome battle on the equipment of the Federal Police , then over a security policy @-@ collection of some Unions of the Interior Minister , in which the Ress@@ ort@@ ch@@ iefs will require a Bur@@ ka @-@ ban and a return of double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also here to reconc@@ il@@ able sounds here .
he is nothing of a return from the double pass .
we satisfy the discussion in Germany .
it doesn &apos;t make sense , be no sense .
and during a Bur@@ ka @-@ ban , he has constitu@@ ent legal concerns .
whether its own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners , and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , must not show itself .
it &apos;s quite a lot , what could fight for war .
but the SPD also tries to pro@@ filing himself at the topic of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Part@@ mar Gabriel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alled only times carefully discussion and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to speak about everything that contributes to security &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it comes to Volkswagen gli@@ mp@@ ite .
despite diesel engines , the delivery date will increase worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs round .
at the re@@ vocation , there are host to a phr@@ ase .
Volkswagen starts out for deliveries in the second half of 2014 .
according to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest motor car can continue to increase further growth in the previous year despite its many brands and some well @-@ standing markets .
but in July the nuclear brand VW was weak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe and thus loaded again the total sales , such as the D@@ ax recorded company .
worldwide , the VW brand sold a 1.8 percent less vehicles in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries around almost one sixth th .
brand @-@ driven Chief Executive Officer Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July mainly on two sales days less in Europe .
Moreover , in some core markets , I have given a purchase agreement in some core markets . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey in Turkey , the British vote was charged to the outlet from the EU , explained a speaker .
in the US , where the exhaust pipes initially es@@ cal@@ ate , there is also another min@@ us of be@@ ech .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the affected house @-@ brand of Lower Saxony has grown in further gli@@ mp@@ ic by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only a delivery minus of 0.9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles would be be@@ ech .
from January to July , Group CEO Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance further growth of sales from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this time , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manip@@ ulated with a software tests .
in Germany alone , VW calls about 2.5 million cars to re@@ armament to workshops .
in the course of re@@ armament , VW confirmed that the transformation of cars has no negative effects .
after upgrading the vehicles it is possible to avoid fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bus service station will be able to provide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee , but not from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty as it was called on Friday in business circuits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason be legal tru@@ ths .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported , Volkswagen granted its German customers now a guarantee for the diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed by the German Ministry of Transport on the last Monday of the VW @-@ Represent@@ ative Office .
from the Ministry of Transport , this meeting was confirmed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW presented the positions of my investig@@ ating commission and to meet the KBA competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations of these shall not be accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed the guarantee that with fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power after conversion has no deteri@@ orations and all typical vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; Guaran@@ tee &quot; but not how it was called in business circuits .
in the wide term &quot; Guaran@@ tee &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers will come to a half year after conversion , with a engine damage to a workshop - and that can result in the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do .
also in customer interest , it is important to avoid that there is nothing to do with any other damage , which comes nothing with the query sc@@ andal , to safegu@@ arding any warran@@ ties , as it was called .
therefore , I use the term &quot; Guaran@@ tee &quot; no .
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund is required by rich au@@ ster@@ ity in future criminal responsibility - the second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ban@@ ker Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who par@@ ked 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German banks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deutscher banks speaks of a fall and sees no signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savings account &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will not be afraid to pay criminal off@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
═ Ban@@ ks money on night at the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , you need to pay 0.4 per cent of pen@@ alties .
this charge requires Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits up to 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily games .
&quot; the first 100.000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 Euro in the year &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been waiting for 40 million Euros that could be turned on the other one day and could not be able to out@@ lay them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay 4000 euros for every million Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost is further increased after the procedure principle .
the cash is easy to lie in the saf@@ es of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank , much too dangerous : &quot; I had already experienced four events , I don &apos;t need to have the fifth ! &quot; said the Bank CEO .
most of our clients could have understanding and changes to other investment forms .
only a few emigrated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ operatives declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy circuit of the EC@@ B caused considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they alone bear alone , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economical isn &apos;t possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account , credit cards or transfers .
with criminal responsibility for deposits of three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burg country had made head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive manager of the Bank &apos;s Association , said : &quot; we don &apos;t expect to pay Private Clients to pay for deposits , this competition is much too strong in Germany under banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker spoke , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cli@@ ent@@ ele , which is somewhat luxuri@@ ously from the property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a small bank for a problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are free of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has set two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ ger , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region , popular actors , athletes and entrepren@@ eurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co @-@ operatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently no further banks are known that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tax rate for deposits of private clients &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the German national banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ Ban@@ ks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich had declared , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold to go to neg@@ atives regarding the private clients , is very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the competition is hard , and it threat@@ ens the migration from others to competition .
customers in Germany won &apos;t like that in the width .

it is not a hor@@ des by Hob@@ bies - it has an emotional meaning : older record tables keep their feelings rather to spend ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone to spend time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .

when this blog would be a news report in television , the camera would follow me while I abide in a busy road in Soh@@ o , a modest road in Soh@@ o before I am standing , keep my hands and say something strange as : &quot; so , let &apos;s throw us a closer look . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart so@@ jour@@ ns slowly on his charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now fill in the buildings where the independent vend@@ or were resident - there is a hand@@ ful of fantastic plate stores .
I would probably ask the camera version to dis@@ able the camera for the next part , in which I stand in the immediate vicinity of different men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind through observation .

the reason why he possesses an such considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy boards , which he was released and again to buy items which he sold , when he was young and ple@@ a .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60s , early &apos; 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably was too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he is right to buy those who buy boards , rather , and glad@@ ly spend time to spend time and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink not much too much .
this is my grid .
We@@ z , 25 , who works with S@@ ister Ray , believes also that many customers who meets the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and buy their old sheets .
of the convers@@ ations which I have led , people usually have received their collection so around 1998 or 1999 .
customers that once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy again their records , &quot; he says .
that would explain the boom to the record of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it only takes a few seconds to a business like Phon@@ ica in order to realize that plate stores offers a s@@ oo@@ thing community of equilibrium .
according to We@@ z , some of the older clients participated in contact with cont@@ act@@ less payments system .
some turn@@ around fans are overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to draw back to the stability of confi@@ ded mu@@ c@@ els , from objects that were happy to use .
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a le@@ ere or the property of material properties as a sort of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z .
that is with me as collector so and I think it is so many people so .
it is a simple way to deal with spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like this is a staff of a record stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people have purchased a plate , they have not yet heard .
the pol@@ l found out that 41 % have a record player who never use it , while 7 % of those who buy a plate , do not have a record player .
at this point of the news report , I would probably look very wor@@ ried while I blu@@ ish through a st@@ acks of Bos@@ sa Nova Com@@ pil@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works in the sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men of middle @-@ age ) has noticed an &quot; trop@@ hi@@ des aspect &quot; of the reproduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone returned here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record players , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead sound record , so that I can set them into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is no big percentage , but it happens definitely .
more productive loads , less musi@@ cally .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older , which are only slowly cle@@ ann@@ ess .
F@@ opp , which has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I am clean .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and women aged women .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned stores - Wild Be@@ asts of the newest syn@@ thes@@ izers and sex@@ t@@ onal pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ills from the speakers - it is good to see such di@@ spar@@ ity in the customer .
none of them looks lon@@ ging lon@@ ging , but wet psychological trau@@ mat@@ a are difficult to conc@@ ei@@ ving hard if one is standing next to anyone about 30 seconds .
El@@ an@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and considered the variety of plates available for sale .
it rather makes a man@@ nequ@@ in as a big one .
they don &apos;t deser@@ ve much , therefore the collection of records does not have any real option , says it .
it costs much .
it is easy to listen to music from one computer or other way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives away with a sweet sig@@ h .
I don &apos;t know how I explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
during I give the ticket that Je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ p@@ ants watches me , I observe a group of young teenage children who were group@@ ed for a moment to buy Pol@@ aro@@ id Cam@@ eras before a father and his daughter to buy a cro@@ sley turn@@ table .
on the left there is a staircase in a staircase of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics that essential sheets for an average collection .
no one sees her - perhaps because they are only pure decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to set it .
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
but considering the fact that every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and then some customers could send to the depths So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to be chargeable .
there is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money , is the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as boards .
even if my research showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , at least in plate business in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality , record business and in On@@ line@@ resear@@ ches exist , un@@ taken into account .
these people probably work hard to school or offices .
they spend their Thursday tomorrow with security not with b@@ um@@ m@@ eln due to plate stores of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they g@@ rie@@ ve the ne@@ at ga@@ ze of an un@@ secret , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator master the young men &apos;s middle age .

French court re@@ jects offer on demol@@ ition of shops in the jung@@ le refugee camp
a French court rejected the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of pro@@ vision@@ ist shops and restaurants in the jung@@ le of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live in the jung@@ le .
in case of a trial , these week argu@@ ed the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the State should have jurisdiction to sell 72 pro@@ visional businesses , sell , hair@@ dres@@ ser services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few Euro in provisional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture argu@@ ed that these places should be torn down , because it would be a parallel economy that would not be paid out of which no taxes would be paid , and which is a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups divided the court that the shops and restaurants are important that the free meals that are offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups , not enough food for growing numbers in the camp .
they led out that the provisional stores and restaurants often have accommodation and free meals for people in need to offer .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the order of people who operate the 72 pro@@ vision@@ ally business , however , that the concerns of Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture are completely re@@ trac@@ table . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would like to play a much bigger role as people live , who live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extremely pleasant conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas of peaceful meeting between refugees and volunteers are offering .
one of the places , which was threatened by precip@@ itation , was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos;@@ Café des camp , which is non @-@ profit and 200 meals a day , English and French classes and an ad@@ visory board for the hundreds of anti @-@ corrosive , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to maintain the kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was told that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children were a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years old are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated that the number of migrants had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number by now - after a steep increase of new@@ ank@@ ets in the summer .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany R@@ aser have to set itself on the next generation of speed monitor : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested especially effective .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the Vit@@ ronic company from Wiesbaden can be used for example to accident on accident where it would be dangerous for mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to gentle bridges with a temporary speed of tem@@ ples , there is often no necessary infra@@ structures to provide a stationary bling block to ensure the speed limit@@ ing .
a long @-@ lasting mobile structure can be too dangerous or elabor@@ ately .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is autonomous : its battery lasts five days at un@@ interrupted measuring operation five days , the case data is transmitted via a modem .
in addition , all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously through several tracks at the same time .
variable speed limit@@ ings and flow transfer to time , driving strips and vehicle class can also be viewed .
in high @-@ driven condition you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that he is not simply plug@@ ged in the measuring operation , so that the wheels disappear in the panel and also disappear outside outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is to protect the bl@@ ers from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer is tested according to information from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used .
foreign authorities also fl@@ ashes with the new technique : recently , France has reduced 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain brings silver in 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by , after Fiji Master@@ class Gold gets
the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten with an outcome of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ od@@ oro stage here in Rio .
the Fiji had a master class in the handling , Side @-@ St@@ epp@@ ing , squ@@ ee@@ zing , line run and ro@@ her strength to win Gold - their first Olympic ist in any color .
the defeat was hit by the non @-@ bad consol@@ ation prize of the Silver Medal - Britain &apos;s fourth day - and they could well be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which she struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back at the final .
but there could be a 15 @-@ man team ro@@ uted in the form of this form .
it could be for GB a consol@@ ation - but it is probably not - that at least one gold medal around his neck will have hanging around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Chief trainer Ben Ryan , the former chef for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult way behind .
eight years ago , they lost any game with the Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this loop is we@@ aving , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji began wonderful and stopped the GB@@ S attacks in fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. at once you would run into driving buses . the World Series winner went for 5 @-@ 0 at the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au , in the corner .
at another four minutes playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i still put another attack on the right corner of which he converted .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly has the ball .
a he@@ ap of Mitchell stops the mountain of Man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa out a third gate , but the Fiji had just stopped .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ p@@ fi@@ ff , and there was still more than one minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ v@@ ou Pre@@ ferred by a further weak t@@ ack@@ ers of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the rest .
it is so , as Fiji had been born to play the 7 , while GB are still ongoing .
it is so too .
UK led fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and ended the fi@@ dence gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the ratios of the first half @-@ time , up to Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran after a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji .
Dan Norton started an attempt on GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran for long to the southern se@@ sul@@ aner , whose fans encoun@@ tered and dancing at the door .
it was not difficult to admire the playing approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i @-@ bag with another attempt in the past seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff sounds , the Fi@@ j@@ is im@@ pover@@ ished , and GB was cut off in lawn .
earlier on the day Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 defeated and Great Britain pressed South Africa in a kn@@ ur@@ red half match from the race - Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive foot work and scored a gate under the post in the second half .
a brilliant late T@@ ack@@ ling from Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning through the fight with the cancer of the trainer for rowing victory
there will be no ke@@ ep@@ tre gold than in these games and I want to call something .
from the first rowing to the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve that enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who were sitting at the Ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was present at the second Olympics without tax wife in succession , the first women in the history of British Sports , which laid a scale of such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 3@@ 9,@@ ter un@@ lock , which is also exempl@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we are looking for two brilliant fans who direc@@ ts over the surface with the elegance of weakness , which does not reflect the species of the Arc de Tri@@ omp@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind each gold in rowing , a batt@@ al@@ ion may contribute to the hel@@ pers , who make the difference and there was no assistance than the trainer , who would not know that day before 30 months , when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had a bladder , the oper@@ able and the did they did .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been quite worse situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could be in the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , could start what the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that is the correct concept under such circumstances .
I needed money , therefore I had to go back again soon .
it was an inc@@ enti@@ ve .
I was in hospital and ran at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it begins .
the rowing in itself is already a challenge , but this makes it still greater .
in the in@@ fertil@@ ity of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who had a ner@@ ve @-@ looking morning to talk about anything else and to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , who was a cent@@ ur@@ ion at the Royal Art@@ illery Reg@@ iment in a use in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . this is maybe something extremely , but it means that much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is repeated just as much as I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive than@@ ksgiving to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I would have no better person for exercising or better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no race lost in the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up .
even during the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot of reserve .
we were very at the moment .
Helen called &quot; Stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to let not carry out .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make something great .
we wanted to achieve a fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , going out and win the race , what we did .
the pair will take place for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ ur@@ ers Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I wanted to say that my last race was .
this would have too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I &apos;m a Olympic champion .
it was so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
it feels like much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years of exempl@@ ary clarity ;
the managing director of the water @-@ purpose group , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , goes into retirement .
the association is considered as &quot; Bavarian &quot; exempl@@ ary . &quot;
a small fresh drinking water @-@ purpose association as an example for the big water producer .
so it was the name of some time in the origin@@ alt@@ on in a contribution of the Bavarian Radio Symphony .
a little later , the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken was accused .
the work of the v@@ eit@@ ing group sailed as a exempl@@ ary . &quot;
behind all the Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years old , was the manager of the association , 28 years of which he was Managing Director .
he was retired at age 65 in the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose @-@ association with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , supports approximately 15@@ 0000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and ham@@ let with approximately 5500 inhabitants .
member states are the congregations of the church , Breit@@ brunn , lou@@ ver , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ah .
there are water supply contracts for further towns and municipalities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ well @-@ master@@ y in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller 1985 was appointed as a water @-@ keeper and was appointed as a member of the association for the purpose of the purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks are very diverse and they stretch themselves from the water@@ line construction and maintenance of office and organiz@@ ational activities , the budget , lim@@ estone of fees and contributions to emergency payments on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as outstanding events they called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1998 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the re@@ building of a central computer controller ( 2004 ) , and the addition of a central computer controller ( 2004 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it did not have any stand@@ still ; it &apos;s always added to the new features because water is to cover life and drinking water that is the most important food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o , she blessed G@@ öl@@ dler &apos;s faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has worked with lots of heart @-@ bloo@@ ds for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association as it would be his own company .
a few weeks ago , he considered real practitioners to present the success of the V@@ eit@@ ing group to Nit@@ ro@@ ofs before the water forum of the district Unter@@ fran@@ ken .
for this he has received much recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller finished with his own praised al@@ keeper Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked for 28 years with him .
he is the best wat@@ ery and he was a faithful kne@@ aded .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as the highlights from his point of view , he described the fountain and the re@@ structure of the association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment were heavy in the church with the church on a 3rd January .
here , at minus 17 degrees the whole night had to pass through , so the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn could only be maintained , because you filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , who will succeed Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man on Friday at 10.@@ 45 o &apos;clock in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( county Stor@@ mar@@ n ) was shot at his partner and deadly wounded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called on us , and indicated that his compan@@ ions have shot to death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the do@@ er upon the flight , after him will be publicly tra@@ ded .
now nationwide , because Sven S. could be travelling by car .
the man is about 1.80 m tall , mus@@ cular , brown and has a gl@@ a@@ ze .
meanwhile , the police have published a photo of him .
it is a few years old .
meanwhile the man carries a gl@@ a@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still bear the weapon in itself , so the police .
he who sees Sven S. will call the 110 .
the Police speaks of a &quot; relationship &quot; .
the sacrifice was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator of 1981 .
the competent police in Lübeck first wanted to do not have any information about the T@@ ather@@ pass or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; but it confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; it is a red@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ tor in Lübeck . &quot; &quot; &quot;

steel - light view for the German steel industry
the ris@@ ky and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains an additional cost in millions of millions .
financial assets that threatened by the industry from the Eastern Europe promotion , are from the table .
the Liberation of Renewable Energi@@ es in the German Steel Industries in the German Steel Industries , said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said the &quot; West German General Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fre@@ it@@ ag@@ ossa ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the European Commission , the European Commission initially planned to ask steel manufacturers that use the gas stove for electricity generation in the oven to the cas@@ hier .
according to the German industry industry , the steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , there is now a fundamental certificate with the EU Commission after talks with competition un@@ miss@@ able Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators will be replaced in the steel drives , all an EEG conversion rate of 20 percent .
but these will not be collected in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the European unification with the EU Commission for its own production .
with this , the status Quo of the existing regulation was largely established .
&quot; &quot; &quot; special meaning have the successful effort by Gabriel for the steel industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is the future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; further must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the reform of the emissions rights , climate and employment targets are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained by IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry has been suffering from Europe since the financial crisis of 2008 under over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation continues to recover as the world &apos;s largest producer China in view of the weak domestic demand for mass@@ aging in the world market .
European Manufac@@ tur@@ ers t@@ oss Chinese steel concer@@ tos price du@@ mp@@ ing .
over the course of this spring the situation has more relaxed .
for example , ins@@ ulating oil on import @-@ steel effect , to others , the economic prospects have been dissolved in China .
un@@ clear how sustainable the price over@@ h@@ aul is .
the German industry pri@@ m Thys@@ sen@@ Krupp continued on Thursday .
most recently the prices have been stag@@ n@@ ated .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
in Thys@@ sen@@ Krupp , the most recently closing of individual works did not conclu@@ de .
in the German steel industry , around 86@@ ,000 people were employed by the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel producer remain careful despite rising prices and increasing orders .
they produced a total of 3.4 million tonnes , six percent less cru@@ de steel than in the previous year , as the economic association announced on Friday .
after a brief increase in May the amount now returned to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production rose by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association calcul@@ ates in the coming months thanks to improved order situation with an increasing output .
community , mind , health : sing pra@@ ises well
she accompanied Ur@@ sel K@@ ipp did her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she finished the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in an seniors choir .
&quot; singing - emotional and physi@@ cally , &quot; she describes .
after a sample it feels balanced , cheer@@ ful and a total of live , says it .
so on the side , they do something good in their health and mind .
for singing , there is a great hob@@ by for seniors , says Erhard Hack@@ ers from the German Senior Partner League .
most of the people sing in choir and share with equal access the joy of music , describes h@@ ack@@ ler .
by regular assembly you can link social contacts and maintain .
because frequently , social and family structures in the old age are often an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel K@@ ipp in their choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can speak and organ@@ ise themselves to the others and to learn from each other - one choir is a special shape of the compositions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can sing in the positive sense , h@@ ack@@ ler believes .
because we exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
those who calls his l@@ ungs regularly calls for everyday life even so quickly out of the pu@@ rest .
even if it comes to get the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hob@@ by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on elderly people S@@ ingen often has a special effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ursula L@@ enz from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; community &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the older generations , the common S@@ ingen had a much higher job , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , explains it .
L@@ enz is often observed that the singing or hearing of songs in elderly people are awak@@ ened many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
lyrics and special melodies can be derived from ende@@ mic events to long @-@ lying events .
in addition , the head requires a special performance , L@@ enz will also be declared .
at the same time , at the same voice and to be concentrated on a given rhythm and adjust the other singers - this is a great cogn@@ itive challenge .
just older people who alone are doing alone , do not only concentrate on himself .
another positive aspect is the recognition of which one goes through the singing in choir , h@@ ack@@ ler writes .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em is growing by singing in chor@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I have long enough , I will get better , and watch over me , and I will strengthen our experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
good reasons to begin with S@@ ingen , so there is enough .
those who wants to try a new hob@@ by , shou@@ ldn &apos;t feel free - even if he means to have little talent , av@@ eng@@ ing L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 singing men who hears it when a tone goes next to next ?
in search of the suitable offer , seniors have different possibilities , says h@@ ack@@ ler .
sing someone out of his friend &apos;s friend in a n@@ ench@@ man , one can simply connect .
many cities also offer insights over the choirs in the surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ ast@@ ical choir can turn right to the church or church leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many senior choirs you can also find on the Internet .
if you don &apos;t have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours must ask help with the Internet research .
the lust has to sing , shou@@ ldn &apos;t connect to one choir , h@@ ack@@ ers h@@ ack@@ ler .
singing the soul well and has something good - this is true for each age .
cats react sensitive as a cr@@ ater of the young
biolog@@ ists have studied in Hanover , which effect the thro@@ wing of cat parties on adult animals .
in her surprise , the male also caused the male not cold - but they kept in the difference to the females always .
female cats may know the ra@@ iny degree of cat &apos;s ten@@ ths at the Mi@@ th@@ aw of the little ones .
they react to ten percent faster on lu@@ te by k@@ itt@@ ens which chose to be found in big trouble , such as scientists from the medical school and medical school of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
cr@@ ater also react to the ru@@ bs of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the Mi@@ th@@ aw of less and strongly @-@ reg@@ ten young are either not perc@@ ep@@ tible , or not of importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H .
it is the first author@@ itative study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ u@@ tionary Biology . &quot;
in an earlier examination , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch @-@ height of the Kitt@@ ens @-@ Schre@@ ie distingu@@ ishes itself with the ur@@ gency of their help of help .
a total of nine adult males and eight K@@ ätz@@ old were observed from the MH@@ H .
to them were played for a herd of little ones who were taken up for three minutes from the Wur@@ f@@ box and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
in addition , they were con@@ fron@@ ted with cry from stronger k@@ itt@@ ens , who were also highly stressed .
the researchers hold their results despite the small sample for sa@@ w@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those who had no own offspring , responded to the cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned away faster to the speaker when this call played very ra@@ iny kit@@ ten .
this ability may possibly be born or development with sex mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males responded ever responded to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby noise .
also , some studies showed that women were sensitive to mamm@@ lings , whole of whether they were already mothers or not , the Bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , an arrest warrant had been issued against the one @-@ sided soccer star of Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
after the coup attempt in Turkey , there will be an important soccer game for the first time in Turkey .
in front of the du@@ el of the arch@@ aic between Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clearly : &quot; business as usual &quot; is told .
already in the case of the susp@@ ending of the exceptional attempt in July , the government disp@@ leased the government , which should not be imp@@ aired .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of taking advantage of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len movement which is responsible for the coup attempt .
it is not made before football .
against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r , the prosecutor &apos;s office issued an arrest warrant .
in the meantime , he is accused of being accused of a terrorist group in America , a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ k@@ r is supposed to be the recipi@@ ent of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible by President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an for the coup attempt .
although , initially , the condition is valid for 90 days , until October , the most of the Turks had no effect on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the n@@ igh@@ tly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Democracy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places in the whole country has declared Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday for an end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into tra@@ ilers and opponent &apos;s Erd@@ og@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; particularly fans of the workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is traditionally not counting the friends of the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what is the coar@@ se of the Turks in view of dramatic experiences in history , the strict ref@@ usal of military coup .
there &apos;s even the fans - no matter whether you beat the heart of Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
in Pok@@ al@@ sieg@@ er &quot; Gala &quot; there will be very special again on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
in its sporty value , the Cologne club set up in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all the competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his club .
in the end of the game against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce , he scored 1 : 0 winner .
the newspaper &quot; Fan@@ atics &quot; showed him : &quot; he was the best of the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the Trophy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I found the dis@@ appointing season for a record champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lion &quot; will also come early in the Europe League early .
in the South of Li@@ g it was only ranked six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only possibility to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed and this is the most important &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as , the year was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , which was the base for the 14th title with 26 season numbers as the south @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ sch@@ ütz@@ e- based on the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the 31 year old .
in the case , the AC Florence had been registered under the Treaty and on Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as only bor@@ row@@ ed Gom@@ ez following the coup attempt to return to the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ Holidays .
&quot; if Mario I want to come to us , he must only say , &quot; cited the magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club@@ man F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the stri@@ ker would have to be ready to ab@@ stain from an estimated age of 7.5 million to € 7.5 million , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Or@@ man is clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t pay its content of Florence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite D@@ oping : this athletes still have medals chances of Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Just@@ in Gat@@ lin was closed twice for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa can not start in Rio .
other super@@ imposed athlet@@ ics sinners can only laugh them - they fight in Rio around medals .
the theme was determined by the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
the Russian swimming pool in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had compl@@ ained after a D@@ oping blocking her start right in front of the games ( 100 metres of the chest ) is cooked and hat@@ ched .
it was a sk@@ ur@@ ly Sz@@ ener@@ ie : with a big smile , she was still in the hall and had prov@@ oked her performance with her appearance .
as a firm stance , they won &apos;t recover gold , the audience broke out in a jub@@ ilee .
nevertheless , there are many more sport@@ s@@ men that go to the start in the Rio Olympics despite D@@ oping past .
here an overview :
Just@@ in Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversi@@ al figures in athlet@@ ics .
he was closed for two times for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his b@@ ann , the Olympic champion in 2004 and ex @-@ world champion runs even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered as the largest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion in 2010 had to be found a six @-@ month lock after taking the intake of the pain by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after surgery , it had had strong t@@ ooth@@ ache after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympic Champion of 2012 , world champion in 2013 and European Champion was positi@@ vely tested on the associated stimulation of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic fought the caught intake and was blo@@ cked for six months .
the four wid@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big gold favorites .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was imprisoned in 2010 and had been closed for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement would have been responsible , deceived Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest man .
I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ er , Belarus ) : probably hardly a athletes , so many medals were recognized as well .
in 2005 , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title for nine years later , after that test@@ oster@@ one was detected .
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to leave Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid D@@ op@@ ings and EM Tit@@ le 2006 due to test@@ oster@@ one abuse .
he also recognized the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment of the International Sports Court of CA@@ S .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is located on rank two of the World Ran@@ kings .
Li@@ u Hong Kong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record and gold favorites was only tested in May , but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year old world championship , notes on taking a banned nutritional supplements were found , the Sper@@ ing of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ de and ran already on July 13 .
bomb error in Thailand - Austri@@ ans viol@@ ated - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand will be in contact with the woman , said the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ eller , Fre@@ it@@ ag@@ early .
they suffered chi@@ ves and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left .
she planned her home trip at the beginning of September .
whether one of the further explo@@ sions on vacation island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ omp@@ on , too , is still un@@ clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs came up in touch with the local authorities , so be@@ ac@@ re . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok Hu@@ a H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in an excav@@ ated area of two bombs .
according to the police , the police have been killed and killed about 20 people , including the Austrian woman , three German , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Fre@@ it@@ ag@@ early rose again two jumps in early , and became a further man according to the authorities .
Ph@@ u@@ ket was also reported in the morning a bomb explosion .
at the Det@@ onation in the vicinity of the popular bath@@ stran@@ ds Pat@@ ong was injured after police information a taxi driver has been injured .
at Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , in the south @-@ east coast of the country , then explo@@ ded another bomb that killed an urban employee .
according to the authorities in a flower tray in front of the prec@@ inct of the coastal police into the air .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south west coast and in Ch@@ omp@@ on on the south @-@ east coast has several injured .
one should go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , named it .
&quot; the bomb attack were the same manuscript , &quot; said army @-@ ener@@ al Dan@@ ai crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fre@@ it@@ ag@@ early before journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to express itself as possible moti@@ ves - probably do it for the deeds of Muslim reb@@ els . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thai media has also wanted to recogn@@ ise a pattern on the attacks of the country , which is typical for the bombing of the country in the south of the country .
the Thai police declared , however , the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is just local Sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one speaker in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will rather go out that the bombs were laid by the bomb of the ruling military j@@ unta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , the authorities have been informed about the upcoming attacks on the south of the country - however , they have not been informed about the exact time and the places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
still be un@@ clear that groups behind the attacks .
the police proved its civil servants throughout the country to intensi@@ fy safety around important government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment area .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bomb attacks , but they usually do not judge for tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ ine , there is a palace that was used by Tha@@ il@@ ica King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the reason of all bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends the Austrian Foreign Ministry on his homepage to aff@@ ord statements of Thai security authorities .
high safety risk ( safety level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ bo and its surroundings .
after con@@ front@@ ations between security forces and Muslim popul@@ ations there is no necessary travelling to these provinces .
increased safety risk ( safety level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday performed a few days after a controversi@@ al referendum on one of the Constitution .
this represents the military of big influence in the coming years .
Jun@@ ta CEO and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ CH@@ A said that the bombs would have been an attempt to make chaos in the direction of stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism .
the military j@@ unta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , turns out to have the kingdom return to stability and order .
however , the military has not succeeded in order to get a grip in the middle of the country in the utter@@ most southern country of the country since years .
more than 6500 people were killed in the conflict .
nearly one year ago there were killed in Bangkok with an attack on a popular Hin@@ du @-@ scar@@ c@@ p@@ urely 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the younger history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is into the visor of the Federal Office of constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several regional offices , the constitutional complaint made under observation also under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see at the &apos; ident@@ ities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Call points for aspir@@ ations against the Freedom of democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Chef Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all such immigrants , the Islamic faith or the Middle East become diffuse in a extrem@@ ist way .
therefore we observe the movement now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns up against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multi@@ cul@@ t @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of own identity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the constitu@@ ents of nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; Identity &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate , sad@@ ly , his authority has close to the decision to accompany him with the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &apos; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try their target group since they stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the constitutional guard . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally , extrem@@ ists are attemp@@ ting to speak with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the Islam@@ ist Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing trem@@ or .
this is not an ad@@ u@@ ary advertising for their own thing .
prop@@ aganda is supposed to be emotional .
young people are due in particular way .
this is dangerous .
recently , there were reports from several federal states reports about contacts of the &quot; Identity &quot; to Af@@ D policies .
Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any findings .
possible contacts of this type may only be relevant for the constitutional protection .
it depends on whether the relevant party - in this case the Af@@ ak - by certain people who are extrem@@ ist , their target direction change and so extrem@@ ist .
thus , if such persons control the influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
with a glance at the significant increase of legal offen@@ ders and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee accommodations , Ma@@ ate , he would not talk about new right terrorism in this connection .
but we &apos;ve found in recent years that there can be legal structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fre@@ it@@ aler Group .
it can be quite true that further legal group@@ ings or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps , or attacks from other right @-@ wing bad@@ ly moti@@ ves .
a German @-@ wide or European control of sp@@ ster@@ ism is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
the present groups are based on regional level or social networks .
wor@@ ried about , Ma@@ ine did eat that many over@@ handles were coming to the account of people who did not have occurred in the right scene in the right scene .
this is that concern .
many of the facts on asylum seek@@ ers are not known as a crime , polit@@ ically motiv@@ ated Criminal attor@@ ney or supp@@ orters of the right scene .
&quot; many people have committed off@@ ences committed before with right @-@ wing organs , who have perhaps elected polit@@ ically in@@ different or for example , CD@@ U , SPD or Lin@@ ke , which then have been ra@@ dically mut@@ ated through the right @-@ wing mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ sburg won the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not always determine the Olympics or world records of head@@ lines at the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is showing the cour@@ ageous performance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
the aqu@@ atics center sponge the slightly over@@ sized s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly , that it was not possible to see more in the TV @-@ pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was chosen .
in social networks , Hab@@ te then became vir@@ al inter@@ ne@@ at .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old was completed with a set@@ back of 48 seconds and occupied the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it wasn &apos;t his just sporting figure that moved the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates at the Olympic Games ?
the C@@ ush@@ ier got a special start@@ ing@@ site from the international managing association .
this will be distributed to make swimming in underground countries .
since in offices , most sport@@ s@@ men are running , I wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ ens is ready for the big race .
fast the first nickn@@ ame made the round .
some media present him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of the W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well @-@ standing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was funny . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he struck only with a minute and nearly five seconds over 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle , where he played no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the panel &quot; were also drawn .
during the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the run by Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i took attention to media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the bu@@ ator@@ ial Guinea @-@ Guinea , when he had to compete in an early run over 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle .
Fr@@ en@@ et@@ ically , Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned about eight months before Olympia and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , the police seized physical .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to leave their data according to an opposite L@@ aster that drove out the part on the counter @-@ road .
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ pped in a tr@@ ench like a speaker of the police Aur@@ i / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the position of the bus the individuals could not leave the bus , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire fre@@ eing the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a ambul@@ ances came to the accident on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ final trav@@ ellers were brought back from a liner bus to Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ner district P@@ ew@@ sum .

the fees per cubic meters of wast@@ ew@@ ater are from October 1 , 2016 for the area of se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / World cel@@ es 3,@@ 44 Euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ denberg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( up to 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( up to 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf the se@@ wage fee will then be increased once again when appropriate improvement measures are needed .
the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf is then at 4.@@ 37 Euro per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , it was approved by the budget of the budget by the country &apos;s budget with Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these san@@ itation systems .
the Kas@@ endorf market is oblig@@ ated to operate due to the legal basis to operate equipment cost @-@ wide .
from October 1 , 2016 the citizens and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ th@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ denberg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg must have to take deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fees are between 48 and 67 percent .
as board director Herbert Schmidt was shown to the panel , a new loan for the se@@ wage plants was necessary for se@@ wage plants .
during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , overweight or covers from the previous year period will be dis@@ closed .
founded in all three se@@ wage plants , Schmidt founded it with all three se@@ wage plants by relatively small se@@ wage , the between 6@@ 800 and 12000 cubic meters per year .
based on the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros will be gra@@ ined .
furthermore , the se@@ wage is slightly dec@@ lining in all three plants .
furthermore , in the past calendar period of all three plants , not least because of their age , san@@ itation and repair expenses were not decreased in a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ th@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth and Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ denberg and L@@ opp .
Schmidt pointed out that in the Al@@ endorf san@@ itation system , the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged due to any damage .
the p@@ umping stations had to over@@ hau@@ led the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems due to the pond cl@@ an L@@ opp . after almost 20 years of operation of the first cl@@ ashes had to be installed , the wast@@ ew@@ ater mud and an additional ventilation possibility to maintain the water regulations in future .
Schmidt : &quot; this extraordinary expenses came to these extraordinary expenses and maintenance costs which are considered to be considered in the new calendar period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which were still clearly below the current calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stein@@ häuser &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made clearly that in the low se@@ wage of waste in the three plants the expenditure on the operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case , Schmidt , supplem@@ ented the market community of great entertainment costs in se@@ wage plants in the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ o@@ rem@@ enti@@ oned plants will continue to remain pre@@ mat@@ urely , since the supply area of the se@@ wage works of Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al will not be extended by these systems because it is de@@ fied facilities .

Snap@@ chat &quot; An@@ ime &quot; Effect on Asian cartoon
snap@@ shots says that this filter is inspired by An@@ ime , but some ob@@ servers say that it is un@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool it allows to change snap@@ shots about 150 million daily users to change reality and borders with ident@@ ities such as sur@@ d the ab@@ sur@@ d .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein .
the filters are un@@ bl@@ oss@@ om , in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally active tools that produce more than 30 million improved sel@@ ections per day .
all troub@@ les@@ hooting are to the public .
in the past , the Snap@@ chat filter have passed away in the past , in which they accused that the app Black@@ face transported or white skin as beauty ideal .
when this week , some of them proposed a filter , which gave them dro@@ pping , false teeth and raised che@@ eks , they called some critics on a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ ash &quot; . &quot;
they asked whether these repet@@ itive contro@@ vers@@ y had a larger problem , that the company has di@@ spar@@ ity .
the messages and the receiving were widespread on Wednesday , with reports of The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ shot , that it would have been disabled .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was intended as a homage to An@@ ime @-@ characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but extra@@ judicial , which have experienced R@@ ass@@ is@@ sm@@ us , remin@@ ded the filter of viol@@ ating f@@ ish@@ ness .
other loan the anim@@ e comparison decided .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose troops were widely distributed over the photos , that the filter &quot; viol@@ ate and rented un@@ pleasant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to ar@@ act with the counter of a very un@@ conflic@@ ting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not successful , but that the yellow @-@ view was moved into the extreme extre@@ m .
snap@@ shots is not the only company that crosses the cultural show dra@@ stically .
the American culture seems to be involved in a endless did@@ acy and integration action , from conference spaces up to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are in the matter of various other than their older players - could be expected to expect sen@@ si@@ vity .
if one of snap@@ shots fil@@ tering a picture , so it is much more difficult to stay such things , as it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Zh@@ u , who works as a product manager and engineering in the medium , decided to er@@ ase their snap@@ shot account , calling the same thing to do the same .
in an ess@@ ay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that r@@ ammed dry contro@@ vers@@ y shows a lack of di@@ vest@@ ments at snap@@ shots .
Zh@@ u critic@@ ized the great part of white , only male leadership and ended their ess@@ ay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either I have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they may meet such cho@@ ices , &quot; said the chin@@ ese American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they are people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they are sure to tell what they say . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat is largely un@@ answered .
the company does not publish any figures for the di@@ spar@@ ity of its workforce and has its status as private companies .
on Thursday , it refused to discuss the cultural background of his staff , but according to a speaker , the company recently recru@@ ited a personnel of personnel , who focused on sub@@ ordin@@ ated population groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zh@@ u said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zh@@ u said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zh@@ u said it will be closed and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask myself if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership of IS@@ IS confidenti@@ ality information , presents committee of Congress
m@@ oll@@ ran@@ ge@@ ons of the United States Central Command changed subsequent information to record a optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it allowed the actual states to Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Members of the Armed Services Committee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command secret services , reported how they changed their ass@@ ess@@ ments to the American efforts to fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , just C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; News Service Information , which were typically sent by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander , recorded regularly a position of the American efforts to terrorism and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published a newspaper article . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened in Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses of our political leaders will be presented , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Festival .
head errors in Cent@@ Com section until the top point of the organisation .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct indications that government peaks in Obama had given instructions to modify the reports , as anal@@ ysts saw the pressure from their superior to the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or I@@ si@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements before the congress were clearly positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com admitted publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second largest city of Iraq remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , republi@@ can convention from Kansas , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the mid @-@ year 2014 to the mid of 2015 , the Central Command has changed the down@@ ward reports to record the risk of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force in the life after it was repeated that anal@@ ysts wor@@ ried about manip@@ ulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights during the investigation .
furthermore , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports were submitted by the Secretary of Defense of the Ministry of Defense .
the Democrat members of the Intelligence Service on Thursday published its own findings with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cent@@ Com created a limited process for the creation of down@@ stream operations to I@@ si@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave the t@@ allest democratic party in the Com@@ mit@@ tee , Member of the Represent@@ atives House Adam B. Ship , announced in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , thus Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of subsequent reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mor@@ ality under anal@@ ysts &apos; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was ex@@ travag@@ ant little room for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave , no hin@@ ts on a intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com anal@@ ysts as regards a &quot; particular political opinion . &quot;
preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress was published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; .
last August , the New York Times reported to investig@@ ating investigations by the Pentagon , which were taken by Cent@@ Com anal@@ ysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press pre@@ ver of the Pentagon , announced in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would have no reports of Congress , while the investigation of the general inspec@@ tors were still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also gave the opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defense welcomed a controversi@@ al discussion of this important topics of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a asser@@ tion that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , however , the alleg@@ ations of the past year , however , President Obama was unable to leave the Central Command for hon@@ est assessment of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a text of about ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , looked at the recommendations of many anal@@ ysts only a small occupying troops in Iraq and had a little time to make sure about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team rose by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to speci@@ fying government agencies that had no significant impact on the financing of the government , because these pro@@ visional refin@@ eries had been put into operation in order to sell oil on the Black@@ market .
however , this knowledge was not published , the Times was in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ sel , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legisl@@ ature to be critic@@ ised by the Senate on a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA gains fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Britain before
one day after having shot three doors during a 6 @-@ 1 triumph@@ s over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memor@@ able performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , it cannot remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
however , that doesn &apos;t know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition , and are equivalent to the British in their group with the British in their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which the two will obtain the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first place fin@@ isher will go a little bit longer from the path that lead the other group .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising result in their success story , four years after they landed in the last London Games on the last of 12 seats .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania on , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey sl@@ ay@@ er in hands ( their two older sisters played the Sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , at 16 , she became a national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
you missed the 2008 Olympic Games , since they could not qualify for the cad@@ ader .
then came the year 2012 , in which she worked for her and her team .
in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham became an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the National Team and began to turn the things to better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , an mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the job at London , which we now have .
we can rip the ru@@ d@@ der completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the tor@@ ch in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the Middle East .
India was without victory in the game , but the team showed surprising and held the game level from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , till B@@ am the game in her hands .
it took a Sprint with a flat ball over the left fl@@ ank , then moved into the middle and lu@@ p@@ ens the ball in the gate around the Americans for a 2 @-@ 0 guide .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez did the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the door@@ ke@@ e@@ pers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
like as B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will the result of the next game hanging on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of Tramp@@ ol@@ ins
wherever you are , as late it is , there are the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inev@@ itable , a sh@@ aving relay change between competition and stre@@ aks .
it is , when the olymp@@ ic tor@@ ch himself would be a combust@@ ible rod , who is enough to protect the wrist@@ s for the Turner for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t listen to the tel@@ ev@@ isions , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neigh@@ bors in the coffee shop , without having Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y or the dispute between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there are Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a female black with dimples , would be quite well @-@ known to Prime Time , assembled by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if it would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner , or even F@@ real .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , f@@ ights in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not univers@@ ally recognized : air guns , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the chest swimming and may rule it long .
but if I could make modest arguments for my particular beloved , then leave the attention to the discre@@ et Charme of the tramp@@ ol@@ ins .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have already been a Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years was so anno@@ ying that many those whom I asked , did not know that there is a Olympic port at all .
this could also be regional Ig@@ nor@@ anz .
although the USA sent athletes for competition , it has never won a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ ines and won a athletes until 2012 , who made it to final round .
the Chinese and the Rus@@ sians are going to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans to share the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year .
the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ jump has a certain external side char@@ me , partly because it sounds for the un@@ cleared ear , suitable for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule as the for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should ad@@ mit that I am not an expert but I &apos;m only a her@@ edit@@ ary Enthusi@@ ast .
it has a hum@@ orous potential - the Cart@@ o@@ on@@ ful cit@@ ations of his never too s@@ wollen s@@ alty - but also the gra@@ zie of the gy@@ ms and dive , which combines two sports , which it essentially combines .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; jumps . &quot;
trying to jump on a gig@@ antic trampoline , shoot almost to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements ( rotating , real and sal@@ tos ) before they work on the feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you will be evaluated according to official review on the execution , degree of difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio mut@@ ually .
the most common Olympic V@@ ektor straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ ons hop@@ ing to go further into gold , faster , upward and over , sometimes up to the target , sometimes back and back on top and down on the playground .
they are not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but in the television transmission , also another executive goal : the world or of the Olympic Stadium .
the goal oriented approach is Nobel , ad@@ mir@@ able , even fan@@ atic , and it &apos;s enough to stir even a viewer at tears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s also what I felt at doing this games as a little effort . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trampoline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ spr@@ ing@@ ers is above .
a back@@ ward movement is not the target .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he or her , seem@@ ingly he@@ avier like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , go to the top , then back to the top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even here , a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no ra@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ aming , elegant setting of time and heavy strength .
it is as Zen as the competition could only be in the Olympic Games .
the qualifying and end wo@@ unds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the end as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
in the middle of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who will probably see in general tum@@ ult .
if the awareness of consciousness can only be achieved by the attacks and the objec@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes , according to the The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his coming to air ring , new fan base .

violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia , shoot on violent resistance of the government .
witnesses tell witnesses that fifty Protest@@ ants were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police in Sch@@ uss@@ ani .
is Ethiopia straight there ?
over the past ten years , one of the most stable countries in Africa was a solid for@@ erunner of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last months the protests against the government kept the country and spread over more areas .
last week , thousands of people fell on the streets and the fundamental political changes .
the answer of the government was im@@ merciful to human rights organizations .
witnesses were witnesses that polic@@ emen were armed and killed on nin@@ ety @-@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed .
in circulation , videos about the protests , probably probably from the last or beginning of this year , such as security people beat young people with sticks , while these were forced to make a hand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief of the UN Authority for human rights is now required . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to keep this country and will still be more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after Nigeria , Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the west .
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror attacks on the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded in a considerable speed .
its infrastructure has dra@@ stically improved - there is a new lease to the capital of Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia had all other than a model for democracy - human rights organizations have consistently led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , with dis@@ sidents were brought to silence .
many were sent into exile , or sent into prison , or were driven into the wilderness of the wilderness .
but this could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress the people and they don &apos;t have other options besides , it breaks off &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in the Ethiop@@ ian Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protest@@ ed .
a generation protest@@ ed .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the land use until the pl@@ under@@ took place in relation to power of the gover@@ ning coalition .
after a widespread elections last year , the gover@@ ning party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition , and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , the ten@@ sions along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a fight for this z@@ ack@@ ing , controversi@@ al line demanded in June hundreds of life .
anal@@ ysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been more or less en@@ forced , could protect tur@@ bul@@ ences and could be armed again .
several factors explain why feelings of de@@ bit@@ ing after years of sp@@ elt under the surface is now explo@@ ded .
the first seems harm@@ less : Smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with social media , since cheaper smartphones were more frequently used and the Internet services improved .
even when the government had access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via the Internet Pro@@ x@@ ies , where they hide themselves .
several young pi@@ er gave it to protests so that they were at protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two greatest Eth@@ ics in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are no natural enemies .
since branches pro@@ sper@@ sed the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Et@@ th@@ op@@ ia mainly Christian flood countries , in politics and economy , while they are explo@@ ited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and living in low@@ lands .
but that also changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests were held in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have dominated the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated un@@ fair by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which account for about 6 percent of the population , and which are dominant in the military , in the trade and politics .
the third reason for un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Mel@@ es , a former vine leader , was until his death an un@@ sealed illness in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian prime minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was viewed as a tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man that could think of corners .
anal@@ ysts say that it was especially vulner@@ able to use early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special contrac@@ ting to work enemies and make them harm@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is missing on this basic course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ al Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively un@@ clear reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
otherwise Mr. Mel@@ es , who arrived from the Tig@@ ray Region of the North of Ethiop@@ ian , Mr H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ is come from the south .
anal@@ ysts say that it does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more bloo@@ d@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections were protest@@ ed according to analy@@ tics according to analy@@ tics that were so fu@@ elled and then stolen from the government .
while the following Raz@@ zi@@ ans were killed many protest@@ ers , even if there were less than in the last months , and this period of un@@ rest went relatively fast .
development @-@ advis@@ able Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , as the new P@@ end@@ omet@@ ry , as well as for its meas@@ ur@@ able progress in poverty .
but apparently this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , protest@@ ers held in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ian city , operated by Tig@@ ray , guided shops and hat@@ red compared to the Tig@@ ray is always common in the social media .
anal@@ ysts say that the protests in the U.S. and other Western allies bring into a unique position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights on the neighboring Somalia , even if they had recently announced that she closed this base .
while the West clearly aims to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to merge his exile in an already vol@@ at@@ ile region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin walking distance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declared his asser@@ tion Obama had been founded IS@@ IS &quot; Sar@@ cas@@ mus &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday the last contro@@ vers@@ y would scatter his campaign , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; Fo@@ under &quot; of the terrorist group of Islamic State .
this clari@@ fication developed new questions concerning the communication skills of the presidential candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , whether he is able to communicate in the situation clearly and under@@ stand@@ able with the American public .
it also brings its co @-@ mates to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection to explain the actual position to explain which he could not have .
after having made the clari@@ fication at a campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump returned to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and consisted of interviews that he really did not int@@ end to appeal to President and Mrs. Clinton .
but in an early mor@@ sel T@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was just sar@@ cast@@ ic .
the T@@ we@@ et was the contrast to the previous day , on which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews that he said to the exc@@ use .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to we@@ aken the statement something wrong to destroy him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , wanted to know the Republi@@ can Presidential Candidate .
the last storm of cr@@ iti@@ que reli@@ es on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to focus on the economic situation on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held spe@@ eches to the economic situation in Michigan , this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return on this topic again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told us that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes , and that he found their speech bor@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought Sar@@ cas@@ mus on his defense .
at the end of July , he pointed out heavy cr@@ iti@@ que , when he thought the Rus@@ sians should act to Mrs. Clinton &apos;s enamel , but he declared later &quot; Of course I thought the sar@@ cast@@ ic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the lingu@@ istic bound@@ aries in politics and then returned to demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declare &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to what the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication specialist that observed the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I believe , he is clever enough to keep his testimonies , so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
rather than instead of the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an even sound tone , since its surveys have declined .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with a big lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and a head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying to un@@ lock himself for his pro@@ vocation , his critics accused him to understand his testimonies or to false his or hum@@ or .
but as he intensi@@ fied the focus of attention in the past months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze his lo@@ y@@ alen Mit@@ ro@@ ite into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of it , such as pro@@ voc@@ ant claims his testimonies also .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ umps &apos;s celeb@@ r@@ ities , gave great effort to defend the candidates in a CNN interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani thus asked the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ umps &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense , that Obama was an almost unknown , small organisation , and he called them back secret , completely false , and therefore it happened , because he moved the troops from Iraq .
most of the ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to argu@@ ing that the government served in Obama , where Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister , to spread it IS@@ IS by taking it under control of the situation in the Middle East .
before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued its attacks on the media and threw them before , on each of his words and to be pre@@ occupied against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats sp@@ onder@@ ed over Mr. Tr@@ umps Ac@@ counts as only one more proof that he is in@@ appropriate for the presidential office .
once more about the price dropped by the market , the café in Green@@ point is back
using the verb Cafe was a fo@@ rest@@ ful cafe in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay a Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years a good coffee ser@@ fourth .
of course , the prices from its Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front was pushed forward .
the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie shop , sold in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of Cup@@ cakes .
loc@@ als made it as the last loss in a fascinating city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is a change , but I still cannot believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but when New York change is , it is also re @-@ fin@@ ing .
an revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted Credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing staff of the old caf@@ és , owner and managing director of the new caf@@ és .
he began working in 2001 in Ver@@ b and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered a customer to provide money @-@ funds for a new external place , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , stayed many things .
it uses the same distributor for the excav@@ ation of the same Esp@@ res@@ som@@ ebody model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he would have experim@@ enting .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ages such as chap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é onions .
there are nature conservation .
the café offers no beer more , there is fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed a st@@ owed current to old people .
&quot; many old customers were also displac@@ ed by awards from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b .
even after they moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way .
after the Ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee t@@ ines , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was clear that it was in the coffee and in the f@@ b that was before me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee again , even if they take a bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea that day instead of their usual icon , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before his work , and he made in@@ sof@@ ar always .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , each day as a Swiss watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ bass with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez , he wanted to experiment and recording new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets its usual order , but sometimes he moves his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he has no gro@@ ove that the soap business has taken the old business space .
in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie to make a special soap for de@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ w@@ ed coffee of caf@@ és .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go down on their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu in Poland and Rodri@@ guez said that he began to present them quickly , so that his new neigh@@ bors will welcome .
the site also has further advantages .
a local saf@@ ari local saf@@ ari wants to fill the cold in cold water and sell it .
there is a chance that the café expanded to an adjacent building .
for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was pe@@ er and told that he was destroyed by the ground when the café was closed .
when the new café opened , She said that the bed of the locomotive and the best coffee is a new coffee as a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a Fein@@ schm@@ ecker , President Roosevelt made a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined Del@@ ic@@ at@@ essen , Fifth Avenue , such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland Water@@ tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was something modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato p@@ ure@@ e , and as dessert a pl@@ au@@ p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histor@@ ian .
Co@@ es last book &quot; CH@@ OP Su@@ ey &quot; was told by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man in her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; tells about life in a residence at the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
their newest cooperation , &quot; An individual meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the story of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a repor@@ ter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , sn@@ ail I@@ mb@@ iss at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has already been in business since the stock market crash 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive trees , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn and potato p@@ ure@@ e did eat .
when the repor@@ ter was set in Hack@@ ney , this pair was suitable for a discussion on food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were taken out of an access and a little budget which leads the access .
imagine , so many pe@@ an@@ uts have to eat that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E grin@@ d for grinding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been put in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , mainly in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .

&quot; &quot; &quot; there were the Americans that sent to the hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the way to which the country went with it , no more the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time in the food for the Americans , a central one @-@ esp@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new bud@@ get@@ ary was banned as a mysterious food , such as bread and c@@ asser@@ ules were added to basic food , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way , Ess@@ ay remains restored , as coo@@ ks could hide im@@ appet@@ ite ingredients under a sweet sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by low dry dry place .
the meat , for years , was the central point of the American kitchen , was a rarely ser@@ fourth luxury .
separate mixtures were tried , as a cal@@ orie rich and nour@@ ishing satisfaction was prec@@ eded by taste or even sound kitchen .
during their research on the book , which also includes recipes , bricks made from this ep@@ och , fried onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; there was no more popular addition to the lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions fit not to each other .
it was typical for many of the household goods recipes .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Roosevelt would have had the same mist@@ akes , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ u@@ ct him with his stomach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as described in the book , the An@@ c@@ ists described an house@@ keeper with no interest in flav@@ ours by Ms. Roosevelt , in fact that the White House produced the slow@@ ing hot food in Washington , but also one of the most controversi@@ al food . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , with food , was rejected once the country came back on the legs .
the legacy of our continuing focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as science on foods .
in the writing of the book the eating hab@@ its of bricks in bricks have understood better - for example , as they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; they actually got sick ill . &quot;
there was the victim &apos;s sei@@ zu@@ res .
after the plates were cleared by Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they moved and Co@@ e a dessert , which they had prepared at home : the pl@@ ums , the President Roosevelt in noon .

he was the hero of Ale@@ pp@@ o : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life in Syria .
he ris@@ k@@ ated all to save his life .
now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died on an end @-@ bomb attack of the Assad regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Omar was a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Hel@@ mets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a civil protection group that saved the lives of almost 60,000 humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29@@ 00 Vol@@ unte@@ ers put their own life into the game to pull people from a bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war area .
they are the her@@ oes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian , which shows him with an 11 @-@ hour rescue of a house from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians of the bright symbolic figure in the grave of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a hero , he has never seen himself , said the image : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die , save lives , I think that God looks at me a mart@@ yrs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar himself had a attack on the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bombing attacks in Syria .
the helicopter type four Fass@@ bombs passed over the Alz@@ adia @-@ District , a chlorine @-@ gas was filled with chlor@@ gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will now remove the remains of the bomb , so that not children playing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he cited his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Greenland : the oldest ed@@ dy is nearly 400 years old
more rare sight .
Greenland is usually only available in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return on board the research ship S@@ anna to the sea .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and floating with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland is only with 150 years of offspring .
the Greenland &apos;s shar@@ k shar@@ k along the bottom of the North Atlantic , an hour he comes to an average of 1,@@ 220 meters .
only if it comes down , the five @-@ meter long animal accelerates to 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this from lon@@ el@@ iness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lifestyle seems to be a patent concept for a high age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues have reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case from a Greenland , 392 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alexander Zh@@ entil &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented on the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ graphic Research in Rostock which means a world record for ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ev@@ olu@@ tionary biolog@@ ist already existed for a long time that Greenland is become old .
only missing the evidence .
Greenland is difficult to observe , however , they live mainly in the Eis@@ meer from Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer the water temperatures of six degrees Celsius , they usually dive in the surface usually only in winter .
researchers know about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s lifestyle .
their temp@@ oral dimensions , they , as they were found in front of S@@ val@@ bard six animals with a transmitter .
the prey put this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of a animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another , had swal@@ lowed the pine bones of a young ice cream .
may possibly ch@@ ase the sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the grounds of the iron and looking Kad@@ aver , which is from higher water dens@@ ities down@@ wards .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues gathered 28 Greenland ha@@ st@@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a cle@@ aring from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimeters long while the biggest 502 @-@ centi@@ metre @-@ size .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens of the shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which will not be renewed in it later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
after the early 1960s , their birth should therefore lie , as a atomic fact attempts to reduce larger amounts of this radio@@ active carbon in the atmosphere .
in which 220 centimeters of length , the third @-@ smallest animal contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from atomic fact that is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012 .
all bigger Greenland we had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts due to cosmic ray in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 centimeters long Greenland will be an age of 335 years , while the Rekord shar@@ k is even 392 years old even 392 years .
that Grön@@ ri@@ o @-@ females can only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , known .
now the researchers were able to arrange an old age .
as one of the animals with 392 centi@@ metres , the threshold of the sexually mature and his age with 156 years was determined , Greenland ha@@ ired with a continuation of at least one and a half centuries .
this is likely to be world record for ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live above all in icy waters is not a co@@ incidence .
the old record holder , a 211 year old Greenland , shaped like a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ sh@@ ined , was caught in front of Alaska .
the low temperatures often run the organis@@ m of living animals living on savings .
so you turn later - and al@@ arms slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often too large .
because the volume is growing much faster than its surface , through which the animal heat ex@@ its .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram eleph@@ ant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should concentrate on it , as possible as possible as many desc@@ endants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolution of evolution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal should not invest his resources in a long life .
building ground in a double pack
with topics around construction , the municipal council of the most recent meeting has been dealt with topics in the most recent meeting .
with wor@@ ries , the board received the communication of mayor Robert P@@ utz , &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated housing work can begin . &quot;
after having been resolved to clari@@ fy the plot and closing arguments , the sale of plots in the residential buildings &quot; Road path &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section of Bin@@ der@@ straße 1 ) are interested in interested parties interested in the way .
the Municipal Council is convinced that bi@@ ode@@ gra@@ ins in rural areas of beautiful and peaceful residential community Schön@@ au young families and equipment was equally obvious .
as it was called , construction permits may be notified immediately in the town hall , on the awarding of the plots , the par@@ der@@ ation is expected to be advised in its September session .
to get in@@ quiries about other industrial enterprises , associated with the creation of work@@ stations , the Municipal Council decided to change its newly created surface plan in the spring of this year , in the spring of this year .
in the field of sub@@ sist@@ ing , the business area will already be expanded by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the City of Frankfurt am Main , so in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the best chances to move from London in London and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most of the Bre@@ x@@ ite vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field of financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is un@@ certain if money buildings continue from London &apos;s financial transactions within the entire EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to date , the so @-@ called EU Pass is sufficient for approval in the UK .
this just use huge US banks .
several banks have already announced jobs to store jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expects the 10000 new jobs in the main &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt am Main &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , combined responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as further important authorities like the European insurance view E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters in Paris , but it is less important for the financial sector less than the EC@@ B .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close to the base bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Luxembourg there is a major fund industry , but also felt like Dublin in the infrastructure worse .
thanks to the great airport , Frankfurt am easily accessible .
further points the town with easily available commercial real estate .
&quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
at the Seine , the rentals of the first @-@ class commercial real estate will also be 50 per cent higher than the main .
in addition , Frankfurt also offer a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as a less crime .
in a ranking of the business consultancy Mer@@ cer , the town stands at rank 7 , Luxemburg on No.@@ 33 and Paris on No.@@ 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if life quality is a question of pre@@ ference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his already strong position as a financial position for the European domestic market , Frankfurt could put further banks and investors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pursu@@ es the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in London there will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite the Bre@@ x@@ it vote .
according to the figures of the Landesbank Hel@@ aba in the end of 2015 , there were approximately 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .

Clin@@ t earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % German government taxes
Hill@@ ary Clinton published its tax statement on Friday in 2015 , this revealed a revenue of USD 10.@@ 75 million for the presidential candidate of Democrats and her husband and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , Clin@@ tons amounted to USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; the former president Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in redemption ; the former Foreign Minister gave a revenue of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Sch@@ uster for her book on her mandate of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ tons candidate for Vice President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine , published in Virginia , published his tax statements for the last ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .

&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ins continued to continue standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ t &apos;s hel@@ pers in Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i announced in a statement .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hidden behind false exp@@ editions and re@@ trac@@ ers in relation to its previous promises to publish its tax statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common to publish their tax statements for US presidential candidate , although they are not obliged to use the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers as a reason for ref@@ using a tax examination by the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas SAM@@ S &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidate in the Democrat &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ umps Special advis@@ ers , said CNN that it would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the control tests are not completed .
Tr@@ umps Crit@@ ics , among other things also the Republi@@ can Presidential Candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already deser@@ ted that his ref@@ usal questions related to assets , its divisions and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already been over@@ thrown on the topic and published on Friday a video on the Internet , in the high @-@ level Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump calls his tax declaration .
on Thursday , she spoke also during a speech on the economy of Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what each other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and release his tax statements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the multitude . &quot; &quot; &quot;
POL@@ IC@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump paid no less tax during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times cited a number of tax attor@@ neys and tax advis@@ ers that might still be the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government taxes are become a theme in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton supports a control that is named after million@@ aires and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ets , who would ensure that people pay more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a campaign event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called the Buff@@ ets , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ et@@ glomer@@ ate here , Tr@@ ump decided to exchange Tr@@ ump to a meeting in order to exchange their taxes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ets said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was subject to a control test with I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anxi@@ ety &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the voters and not before the tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons campaign made tax rights back to 2007 .

the tax statement of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that it is only USD 100 of its income as a salary than the majority of all Americans .
their main funds was an economical index fund , from which the Clin@@ t divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9,000 contributed .

the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had already intensi@@ fied the idea for years , together with the U.S. nature conservation and intensi@@ fied their funding in villages in the north of Tanzania , to use a violent four @-@ stroke method to protect their houses and harvest@@ ing without the animals .
previously , many spe@@ ars have used to defend itself .
Friday is the phone day , which is dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we could have observed a change in this municipalities in which they can hold the eleph@@ ants of their fields , without damage to the eleph@@ ants , &quot; expressed the general manager of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a communication .
the first two steps comprise the eleph@@ ants with a tor@@ ch and bub@@ bles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if he is not stretched out , there is a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ili@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a touch righ@@ tly in the rule has already been ch@@ ased out to hunt the eleph@@ ants .
the last option is a w@@ ander to shoot a gold fire@@ work into the air and caused a lau@@ rel , bright explosion .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director sm@@ ashed Berlin Hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a French director with Jewish roots had un@@ sealed a media line after having betrayed the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , because Arab guests had been requested according to one employee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust @-@ Sho@@ a Bristol Hotel in Berlin , made an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , l@@ ance Israel attempted to find Israel at the country &apos;s country selection list .
however , the country was not listed among countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel over an own call center .
after a statement , the director turned to the hotel rec@@ ep@@ tual design .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer that he got there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; got him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that the measure is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason that stood behind , dissolved in the director more W@@ ut .
&quot; most of our guests are Arab@@ s and they have demanded that the pre@@ fix is deleted , &quot; the employees of Lanz@@ mann have been cited .
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ as @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were astonished and dis@@ ma@@ yed from this event .
this is really very disappointed .
the fact that this in Germany has added in exactly this hotel chain , it is even greater dis@@ grace .
no explanation requires .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ministers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident dissolved a rather big reson@@ ance on the Internet in which the people called the whole sc@@ andal .
some supp@@ ose the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have had given the alleged authenti@@ cation of Arabic guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disappointed you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called it in another post that is noted on it that the hotel is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm in the vicinity of a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly proved all the alleg@@ ations of him and called the incident a &quot; see &quot; and &quot; exc@@ itation &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never have a direct statement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel does not include the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a speaker for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds to add that the country code was added to the country code .
police sets Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de to protest@@ ing Brazilian students
&quot; &quot; &quot; students met on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police , when they gathered themselves together to demonstrate the government &apos;s reforms for the public educational system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police led Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties started , as a police officer , the students tried out what led to the police , rubber in rubber and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their short@@ ening above the plans .
according to the proposals of the governor of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo , Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students will save money .
some of the Protest@@ ants saw a gra@@ ff@@ it@@ its against the provisional release of Michel T@@ emer on walls .
the recent protests occurred some days after demonstr@@ ators went into masses on the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , which had been ab@@ stain@@ ed by a vote of the Senate on its re@@ vocation .
trade between Russia and Iran rise up to 71 % - RT Business
after the re@@ vocation of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , who grew up between Moscow and Teheran in the year comparison to 7@@ 0.9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran , the interest increased on sites of Russian businesses to shops in the country , divided the amb@@ ass@@ adors to the country .
Russian enterprises take existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to make access to the market .
of course , the further trading company is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he noted that trading volume between Russia and Iran during the first five months of the year 2016 grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran , and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
from Iran , Russian imports increased 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade up@@ swing was reached by deliveries of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes for this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , Russian Foreign Invest@@ ments had approximately 35.000 Vis@@ as , primarily associated with Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries that affects the economy in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Irish tourists in Russia will be broken out of the last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , just relatively few Rus@@ sians will visit Iran , something , from which the ambassador hopes to change it .
&quot; I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received the monuments of the old Persian civ@@ ilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms home when burning gold for cycling
Scotland Call@@ um Sk@@ inner &apos;s last evening in the male team of Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame , when the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow had taken the anchor , who made his coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y , who made the legend proud when he stor@@ med at home to win a victory of the favourites of New Zealand .
four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ ail@@ ies .
they repeated the tri@@ ck after being held in March at the railway world championships in London despite the back@@ drop of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the substitute of the An@@ er Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as an execution .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap that tried to close K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man where they stayed when they saw the potential in the vill@@ i , which now ob@@ sol@@ ete itself .
Hin@@ ds , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y , and Sk@@ inner continued in the qualification round , but in the standard rounds the New Zealand th@@ inks in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap almost back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner .
a strategy change made a major part of the transformation , with the execution in a higher gear , to slow it down and keep it characteristic and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they were on the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
we set up a Olympi@@ ad record in the final round and over@@ thrown the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win .
after the triumph of Triumph 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , there was a weak start to the track .
he returned this statement later and there was no appeal to English rival .
in such an outstanding victory there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels complete with all the GB flags on the grand@@ stand as London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have joined the last three months as a team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are so bad for so many world championship so bad that it was incredible once again at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the adv@@ ancement of our progress in the last five months is that we expect our successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the shape of Kenn@@ y , it is in the area of possibility that it repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
this would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a apparently Holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster was born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the cheese of Ho@@ y equals .
Kenn@@ y takes part next to the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels some feeling to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; When he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the kn@@ ight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ on competition of the day , but there was another good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ in W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed Cl@@ ancy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the World Record , who won gold in London in 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 659 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , with a focus on safety and safety .
yesterday , he had fought yesterday with evidence of the qualification , as the officials called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , the tomorrow continued and finished , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world record time in 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
the GB team leaves its strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a donation to medals .
after an extraordinary depic@@ tion of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio went down .
again , Dr@@ amas in the background , as the re@@ sign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April , in the middle of sex and mo@@ b@@ b@@ ing@@ les , as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ leton .
however , if one sees itself the first evening of the competition at the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks after that the legendary reputation of the GB@@ S , which has been a perfect moment for a perfect moment .
future of melt by Portland due to the removal of the energy supply
the future of aluminium shells from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places - stand on the game , since the plant operators are announced to announce the energy supply contract , as provided by the supplier energy companies .
this step followed by the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to operate the plant .
for a period of 20 years , a maximinum payout runs in November .
up to 2000 work@@ places in the plant of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland stand on the game .
no less than 2000 jobs , direct as well as indirect - could be endangered with closure .
in addition , it could come to domin@@ ium effects , since the melting f@@ uses some 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vic@@ tor@@ ias .
in 2014 AL@@ CO@@ A closed the Point Henry Trail that led to a closing time of the Angl@@ es@@ ea force last year .
the melt of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland loses money and ris@@ ky a closure .
this step follows the lon@@ rel@@ ing spec@@ ulations regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the current price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the big aluminium shells with his Lo@@ y Yang A plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , divided that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is located in the majority possession of a joint venture of AL@@ CO@@ A and Al@@ um@@ ina , the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L is that the plant will continue to operate in Portland , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melt means , &quot; divided the company with .
as of November 2016 , AG@@ L continued that the contracts are called &quot; securing transactions &quot; which will be into force in November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of notice , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assume that the contracts for the financial year 17 will contribute to the income , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L income from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong appointment markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of contracts already in its annual statement of $ 187 million in &quot; expect@@ ation of a termination &quot; notice .
AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to sur@@ ge the tre@@ aties , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the sm@@ elling or the power supply to melt the melt &quot; not imp@@ aired . &quot;
the U.S. company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have entered into force from November this year , even if there is still a statement , why it has withdrawn from the contract .
analysis of anal@@ ysts due to the poor economic conditions in the industry before the possible closing of the Portland melting in Victoria and Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
in reference to the work of the anal@@ ysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland consume about 600 meg@@ awatt some 900 mega@@ watts of electricity annually .
if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean significant reduction in demand on the &#91; current market &#93; .
and for us as a generating sets this would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of the V@@ ogue
Kendall Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner Cl@@ ans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US V@@ ogue .
Kendall , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der is and went to fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the view of this cover &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Kendall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the revel@@ ations of the Co@@ vers followed a bizar@@ re ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ an Family ) ( with the exception of the most popular show@@ c@@ z On@@ k@@ els and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) as well as in the presence of their sister &apos;s most popular show@@ c@@ - On@@ k@@ els and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest .
this makes the kl@@ isch@@ ee@@ tered plot close to every birthday present ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You could have forgotten you ? &quot; , with the hon@@ esty of an animation at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to leave her other girl som@@ eh@@ ow to this pub .
with regard to the Sept@@ ember@@ issue of the V@@ ogue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began .
Kend@@ alls big sister Kim likes to beat what the V@@ ogue cover is defeated ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league .
the Sept@@ ember@@ 2009 edition is the most advanced edition of the year .
with a circum@@ ference , rather resem@@ bles an image band as a fashion magazine , the issue attrac@@ ts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( see Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista of the 8@@ 32 pages of the roller 615 pages advertising ) .
the revel@@ ations of its Co@@ ver@@ stars is expected to see that in the last two years , the magazine still had to dis@@ counted images on the official announcement .
women who were already in the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ r@@ ities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the modeling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , the celeb@@ r@@ ities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ Pre@@ ist@@ ern and Di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 in the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even at the low chance that Mr@@ s Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; fe@@ eb@@ le model &quot; of its generation - under the former category , it is in good company .
these celeb@@ r@@ ities are not related with famous persons or using Reality Stars or teen@@ ager from today who know how to kill a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything goes on Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once appeared on the last cover , with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like every success .
J@@ enn@@ ers became a position in the fashion world with its reality TV history .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her Kol@@ leg@@ in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called them &quot; the mist@@ akes of the moment . &quot;
these feelings v@@ ow high , when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the V@@ ogue cover .
but on the mist@@ y of the mist@@ y , it seems to be related to the point .
Bandera Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the V@@ ogue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it creates advertising for your pri@@ mer by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
and all of their sisters sell you pictures from their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells pictures from Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine LO@@ VE .
and in her free time she is seen in reality TV . presumably , in order to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal centers include 16@@ 0,000 people each year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the aid of the country are processed every year by the municipal centers , while the sector accounts for the effects of further medium @-@ cut transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ real del@@ og@@ ations and similar , with their request to free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which have already been out@@ law@@ ed , make themselves ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , these legal centers are expected to lose further 30 percent of their federal rights .
the Director of the Municipal Cent@@ res of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Cent@@ res revealed that thousands of people had already been rejected by people each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse without a repe@@ al of the federal government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land municipal centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people from important services you need to be rejected . &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ imag@@ in@@ able and impressive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers , the od@@ d @-@ way have problems - all these people have problems of just@@ ify themselves that they cannot receive the help you need them .
as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will sh@@ orten the funds by 30 per cent , which means thousands of helpful people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to just@@ ify their legal problems without any help .
we call for the general federal prosecutor and Federal Minister of Federal Minister , as well as Sen@@ ators from Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to return this medium , so the people need help them that require legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal entities on national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of municipal centers and their customer communities , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government invested in this important work .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey before European elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the Federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , substantial losses for government plans SPD and CD@@ U .
this showed representative surveys of opinion research institutes IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; Zeitung ( Friday ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could go ahead on the north , this is not possible after the fra@@ ctions in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party in both federal states and would have good chances to keep the government &apos;s head .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD over@@ threw 3@@ 5.6 percent from five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party was only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could rise again to 23 percent .
the third place is fought between the left and the Af@@ ak .
the l@@ ent cheese came to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country .
in spite of slight losses , in spite of slight losses related to 6 per cent ( previously 8.7 percent ) again in the heav@@ y@@ day of the country .

Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator : the first smartphone
E @-@ Mail and Internet in Temp@@ or@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Commun@@ ic@@ ator came into the market .
the successor today domin@@ ate the world - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a half @-@ year and was more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5 .
it was dense and bigger , it was therefore not good in hand .
on the contrary , it was quite cyclo@@ big .
the built @-@ in memory amounted to eight meg@@ abyte , which would be sufficient for approximately two sel@@ ections with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the business - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euro lovers will buy the devices still on the Internet , but they were som@@ eh@@ ow from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
however , 20 years ago , the Commun@@ ic@@ ator was a sens@@ ation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at C@@ eb@@ it computer exhibition C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as a &quot; office in the western survey format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent to a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails were sent and received , also by fax it was to be the Commun@@ ic@@ ator .
even access to websites was possible via HTML browsers , even so slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and a electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be similar to a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen found .
quite proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 Euros .
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 Euro .
no one could have in August 1996 that the Commun@@ ic@@ ator of the beginning of the smartphone would be .
since then everything is different .
the clu@@ sion teleph@@ ones are a success story , if also not for Nokia .
the mobile phone card of the fin@@ s experienced an unprecedented desktop , was finally sold to Microsoft .
the market today is provider of suppliers that came much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere , this is today for very many people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold around 1.4 billion devices , Samsung and Apple account for around 555 million units alone .
global sales with equipment is around 400 billion euros .
to this end , the well @-@ running business of the countless App providers and the telecommunications company will come .
around the smartphone it has developed a whole industry .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and a internet communications , all with touch screen easy to use .
Apple began on Apple &apos;s victory , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the enterprise .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market .
finally she disappeared , Black@@ berry has lost .
the s@@ ages now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention a self @-@ comprehen@@ sion .
on the cut , each Germans always looks at his phone 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to learn all the smartphone too , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , in the Siemens executive board for staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent in@@ ability is now considered a curse and blessing .
England must expand the Olympic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row won &apos;t only be in our local communities and throughout London , but in all the country renewal and pro@@ sper@@ ity .
for me , the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as it was in 2012 in London , when we run a major effort to ensure that all our nations and regions were prof@@ ited from playing .
the Olympi@@ ad brought large advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and we will be able to reach new opportunities for local and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local congregations , we will already generate 10,000 new apprentices , 40,000 new jobs and youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is too big .
I told me that England has never been ready for the games and that we will be able to bl@@ ame us on the world stage .
the two was wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but He@@ ath@@ row answered every question .
as the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
expansion is an option to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 bn of funny growth and a legacy of skills and employment both to leave the airport as well as in whole UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has a £ 11 bn investment program in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal was built , until the T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequency @-@ test run ste@@ els .
now they are ready to deliver a third mil@@ eage , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investments .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is also one .
it &apos;s time to expand this Olympic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row , as well as our future trading and create a legacy of skills and employment creating the England .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding display block@@ age
&quot; &quot; &quot; for businesses looking with online advertising money , according to one of the software manufacturers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tests , ad blo@@ cked &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block the display on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blo@@ b in which it could update their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the encoding regarding his advertis@@ ements to identify it displays , which is part of the site advertising , too difficult to detect .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to handle the new code .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle between the present@@ able open source community and the conversion has already been possible since the invention of display sco@@ ot@@ ers in the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that it is possible to get Facebook soon with a new solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media has left in the struggle , is a strong indication of it , such as concern @-@ ar@@ ous@@ ed indicators for the industry .
according to a study , according to a study conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people advertis@@ ers worldwide , nearly four times as much in 2013 .
with 1,@@ 03 billion daily users of active users who access Facebook on their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ wer@@ advertising took 84 percent of advertising departments .
the company has no effect on Facebook computers on your desktop PC , since mobile ad blocks does not have any effect on fac@@ eb@@ ooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , a speaker distributed .
advertisement on desktop PC makes a suff@@ ici@@ ently large proportion of revenues , so Facebook appears to the investment of such a step as a re@@ warding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad refer@@ enced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to update the people more control over them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claim that adop@@ ting new filters would be ar@@ ous@@ ed , because they would also block content on the page that are no advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users , there is no positive experience , therefore we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared a speaker of Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad blocks are a st@@ ump means , for which we have focused on the development tools such as Ad pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of people .
woman with suspected suicide on Swiss highway
the victims was right in the middle of the night .
the police calls witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday , committed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
incident occurred at the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman put in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a act of desp@@ air &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police in V@@ aud &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss service at the age of 49 , which was used by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , but wanted to kill himself .
she died still on site .
several drivers have already been taken , but some are still not identified , the police arrested this , as well as every voucher of the incident .
it was opened an investig@@ ative procedure , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , the G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait if one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a coll@@ ision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosecutor must decide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be moved to responsibility .
in each of the two cases - where a person running in the dark on the highway - was decided that motor@@ ists must not go out that a pede@@ stri@@ ans was running in the middle of the night , as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acquitted of neg@@ ligent hom@@ icide , having killed one man and killed one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and became un@@ conscious in the street , and took the court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Court noted that the polic@@ ew@@ oman had answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a just@@ i@@ rous way was a just@@ i@@ rous manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the presence of a man on the road was an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the judges . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges has to sign up with the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate Protection dell : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
according to the projec@@ tions of a new NASA climate model , Venus was likely to be hab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble from climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus could be treated with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 dense atmosphere .
scientists previously noted that the slow circum@@ ference of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the newest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin but similar atmosphere could still be slowly rotating .
the model lit also the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably pointed out more dry ties than the earth , but had once enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and har@@ sh faster before evap@@ oration .
early Venus also benef@@ ited from an Sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the ISS @-@ Model simulation , the slow circum@@ ference of Venus is almost two months long , &quot; declared G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which is like a umbrella , in order to sh@@ iel@@ ding the surface of most of the sun .
the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than the earth today .
the model brought a history of the Venus that resem@@ bles the evolution that was suspected of resear@@ ches earlier .

Patrick Roy coming back as a coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che , and led to the decision to become a low @-@ decision decision on decision of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new trainer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last three years I met my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy joined a position . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have thought during the summer long and much more about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , this it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation &apos;s vision .
he must also have a certain decision on decisions which influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who finished in Roy on May 23 , 2013 , was on account of his contributions for the team .
&quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Z@@ acc@@ ic .
we all appreciate what he did for our organization and wish him for the future only the best .
Roy has been awarded the Best Trainer of the League during his debut season in 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he led the association to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the play@@ offs of Minnesota and missed in each of the last two years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in season 2015 @-@ 16 and fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .

Nord@@ es@@ ee@@ pers take back talks , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the strug@@ gles regarding the re@@ mun@@ eration for North Se@@ arch@@ ers are exposed , while all the armed parties are to set for a new round table round the table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; negotiations negoti@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group was performed spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group and the Un@@ ite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trade unions can confirm that we agreed to start the wrap process of current streams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold some full @-@ day meetings during the next weeks , which will begin to start the beginning of next year to start the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage reduction of up to 30 percent .
this year the wood Group has shortened the rates of its contrast to the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the implementation of the company follows a 10 percent reduction in on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts of the companies are given the required space to come by the market up@@ swing .
for his part to thousands of people , Shell has announced plans to aband@@ on his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as a result of its operations as a result of the British energy company BG Group r@@ ational .
energy companies are under pressure on lower cru@@ de oil prices under pressure , an economic situation that led by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the largest working groups that took place in the North Sea since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important to the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not only for few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend new projects in the North Sea in comparison to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the constellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space teles@@ cope has helped to collect the complete catalogue on rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star cluster of the ple@@ j@@ ades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new data help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star@@ ring loops are rotating in different branches as well as in which context the rotation periods of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Planet@@ arium &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we hope to get through the same our results with other stars , more about the relationship between the mass of a death , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the constellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 445 light years away from the Earth .
many stars in this constellation , which were created around 125 million years ago , reach the adult age now .
you can now turn on the fastest .
towards top rot@@ ational rates , these sm@@ el@@ ly stars will catch large quantities of stars .
since these winds are travelling through the magnetic fields of stars , they have a slow effect to the stars .
when a star is pressed , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of any death by taking the time between the appearance of an recogni@@ z@@ able star spot -- like Sun@@ spots -- det@@ ects .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that massive stars are slower than a less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull is compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ds are smaller than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ y@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors to be massive , massive vig@@ orous rot@@ ors to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the constellation of the ple@@ dge is so close , it serves as an ideal companion to compare its qualities as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the constellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
it &apos;s still much ahead of us what we want to learn more about how the How , when , and why stars slow@@ down their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their newest analysis of the rotation rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the astronom@@ ical journal .
a controversi@@ al bas@@ eball Star enters

after his emotional recall , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional event will take place on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay . the opening of his New York Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es took place last time .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I tell &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; , the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star game participants of major league bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times was elected the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year treaty signed him a total of 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
by the end of the contrast , on 31 December 2017 , he performs as a consultant and youth coach - with full content .
as a player we paid Rodri@@ guez for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 Hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 @-@ 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed to take some mil@@ estones .

for so Rodri@@ guez - nickn@@ ame &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field was so controversi@@ al is its occurr@@ ence outside the place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was given to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ster@@ oids &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a pleasure for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez then has swe@@ at back then . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his f@@ arewell days are not dis@@ appointing .
while many bas@@ eball @-@ le@@ gen@@ ds played the big stage once again , Rodri@@ guez frequently had to sit on the bank .

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski
caught , because of a positive di@@ op@@ ing@@ sample , the Wei@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski ( Poland ) may not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be over@@ sh@@ aded by the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ cases .
a caught athl@@ ete could have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ cases have become known for the Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese flo@@ od@@ ine Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter Obst@@ acle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish ge@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski have been positi@@ vely tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the successful athlet@@ ic athlet@@ ics competitions this messages come to the accident .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tics has been detected on the past Sunday that used hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de that is used as a mask on D@@ op@@ ing@@ sub@@ distances .
the International Sports Court of CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon in their exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly , only around 0,@@ 09 seconds it missed the bronze wa@@ ist .
on Friday Ch@@ en would have supposed to participate in the pre @-@ operation of over 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
Ch@@ en has applied the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the National Association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a Communication : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work with the International Sport@@ court of CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , no longer the IOC , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sanctions of athletes with positive ones .
also in the night of Rio , the news about the positive test near Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she be innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report it is expected to act with the banned substance by the EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was pro@@ vision@@ ally suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B test should also be positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ jko Bor@@ is@@ sow moves to the athl@@ ete with criticism of the athl@@ ete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right shots , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We stand up under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so for example , all weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter is not allowed to participate in the chronic d@@ op@@ ing@@ ling nation in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was also known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in the class up to 85 kg , like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the an@@ ab@@ ole Ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both attacks are taking , however , they are not able to start in class up to 94 kg .
prior to the start of athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is particularly serious blow for the reputation of the entire sport .
the World Trade Union IA@@ AF had the complete Russian team until an exception because of systematic response to the start , also the fer@@ nation in Kenya has produced numerous bad news .
in the swimming sport the previous ten@@ sions in China had to come into severe disputes between the athletes .
so the Fr@@ ench@@ man Camil@@ le Lac@@ our@@ t took the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt l@@ ila &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle I want to pass me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun stood at the centre of a debate with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for D@@ oping @-@ Bet@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positive in 2014 with the Chinese nationals for stim@@ ul@@ ans Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit a three @-@ month lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de press h@@ acker your ran@@ s@@ om
programmer from Er@@ press@@ ment malware provides specifically targeted businesses - and are successful .
according to a recent survey of malware specialists , Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany were 40 percent of the survey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months at least once , partially with victims of a attack with de@@ pres@@ ser software .
in Germany , nearly 20 percent of companies have already achieved target of a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware production .
40 percent of the victims were will@@ ingly prepared by the perpet@@ rators which are required to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their pres@@ pres@@ sions software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes and attacks on attacks in the company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially limit@@ ing lion money is distinc@@ tly higher than in private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have seen an out@@ stretched fast evolution of the damage software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mal@@ gen@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most of the mal@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertisement .
then discovered the perpet@@ r@@ ator software for itself .
only private users were the target , but the changing to the company took place in the past months .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is working after a simple pattern : once upon the computer of an Op@@ ator , she is looking for targeted files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as to archives of pictures and videos .
these files encrypted the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als .
afterwards , the software presents the demands of the pres@@ ser .
in order to get the final code code to the files you have to transfer the victims - usually in the form of the cryp@@ tion Bit@@ coin - .
but where private users can use the personal photo database on the game , it goes to companies around sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage causes damage , if a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is achieved .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenues by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 per cent had to complete the business activities , in case of a case , people were living in living .
in Germany , multiple hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened with loss of patient &apos;s loss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not pay , you bear only the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data again .
for managers , it is difficult to refuse to stand@@ still in operation the requirement of the perpet@@ rators .
the h@@ acker turn again and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety findings of F @-@ Secure saw the use@@ able area and contact with the mail@@ ers and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a type of customer service to take more money .
you explain to their victims by chat as you can pay via Bit@@ coin , freely available support sites or de@@ cryp@@ t for free example files .
and are redeemed after payments of a few hundred Euro , companies must have hard negoti@@ ate and five @-@ digit sum@@ s to withdraw their data .
in view of potentially high and relatively ris@@ ic profits from the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware exploration , the h@@ acker is always professional and share the work , explains security experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ewski of the antivirus @-@ provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware within a week . &quot;
the probability is that it is about three or four persons .
the programmers sell their damage software then in the form of a software construc@@ ts to the real refresh@@ er .
the previous malware kits produced by the malware itself , advice and additional tools for one single , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars were purchased .
&quot; included in delivery is an adap@@ tive pool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski .
the pres@@ ets are then looking for further h@@ acker to spread the fresh@@ ly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service economy .
so , in one of the for@@ ums , one bu@@ ys the set of a crime and commissioned the software to install the software to as possible as many PCs .
the payment is made per in@@ fied calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als carry the sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ewski .
the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now known for many companies that ensure their data better .
over 50 percent of companies responsible for the companies of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ dness survey carried out to drill R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanning software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursu@@ ing new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threat to successful inc@@ ess@@ ation , the perpet@@ rators instead , with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or quot@@ ations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ b@@ oss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
this makes the potential potential of damage , depending on the type of data , a multiple of more than before .
as well , the perpet@@ rators could now take completely new destinations in the Internet of Things to Kor@@ n .
on the h@@ ack@@ er@@ conference def@@ con demonstrated safety for@@ ter , such as it could get a thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter the air split of a type block could be quite a ran@@ s@@ om .
if the perpet@@ rators then instead of heating into the future a whole production line in a factory could block R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , could also become a topic in the Industry 4.0 .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday dust
in the small HR @-@ V Honda will pack everything : a little SUV , a little coupé and also the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
it sounds pretty easy , but the HR @-@ V , who has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , can actually be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and also in the rear , there is no spot tight .
the materials of the interior space can be processed and work comfortable , only the cockpit surface falls off there .
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in storage space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not just a boot of 453 l at high @-@ set and 10@@ 26 l when folded back @-@ down back , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s less magical as it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded as Kin@@ os@@ essel , and offer the storage space that is high from the ground up to the ceilings 1,@@ 24 m high .
the trunk can be loaded well , however , the charging height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque value of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , his work is likely to do somewhat qui@@ eter .
the everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another engine ization : a 1.5 l petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
but the steering is likely to be a bit of direct .
the equipment can be open no wishes in the &quot; Executive &quot; top version &quot; Executive &quot; .
the City @-@ Not@@ bre@@ ms@@ ent ( works up to Tempo 32 ) is part of the coll@@ ision system and the trace heating system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coll@@ ision failed , sometimes , because he rated many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her@@ b@@ ating objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very reliable , the remote control unit works very reliable .
and the intelligent speed controller acts on the traffic sign recognition and threat@@ ening the speed when needed .
the full connectivity is only available for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touchscreen , Nav@@ i , App Integration and more .
two USB and an HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel engines are fine .
who doesn &apos;t want to invest in so much will receive the petrol engine from 20000 Euro , the diesel starting from 23@@ 000 Euro .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda provides a versatile and everyday use .

but this is to change : the legal guarantee should be extended .
this is a good news for all car drivers who stand at the ambient road every evening in the St@@ au where they drive through the motorway A@@ Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
road construction is extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 @-@ 17 August ) in the area between hammer road and the descent Wes@@ er road leads the right track lane by 700 metres .
motor@@ ists can then drive directly from the Hammer road to the right .
the great advantage : the traffic shares early , thereby reducing the total amount by the Bundes@@ straße 51 on the much running section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district apostle of Münster @-@ West .
the lane crossing at the Zu@@ br@@ inger is nervous especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
the back@@ drop goes back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ ping road and sometimes also beyond .
reason the eye can@@ yon is located on the B 51 shortly before the descent Wes@@ er Straße .
from here , traffic will only be guided with the motorway bridge over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be returned to a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations have shown that the bridge has no longer the required load capacity to absor@@ b the gravity traffic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated st@@ acker is connected , the responsible state may not say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , when the bridge is expected for years : because the bridge has an official rest of the time by 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal fle@@ ction line , the state operations are aware of the bu@@ sti@@ ff@@ ed time in school holidays , because with disabilities have to be reck@@ oned .
the traffic will pass on Tuesday and on Wednesday on Wednesday at the construction site .

most young people of the class are between September 2015 and March 2016 among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria come to Münster and said little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ograph@@ ies , the scen@@ ic pictures and video animations would have been possible to follow the action performance , thus the press release of the Young Theatre in Münster .
the association N@@ IMA &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg , and the Young Theatre will work together in the next season in the context of a music theatre project .

offers for children and families in the theatre game and the@@ atri@@ cal language courses are in planning .
the &quot; Intercultural Journey &quot; project continues .
given the increased refugee numbers , the association calcul@@ ates with many classes which want to participate .
rain instead of ob@@ servatory : hope for weather effort
the weather has made the star Gu@@ ck@@ ern Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a holding by the bill - but there is still hope .
the night is well suited for clouds and rain so well , the sky &apos;s spectac@@ le , said the chairman of the Ob@@ servatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we will see many star cliffs in the sky .
with the con@@ servatory it is about Pers@@ ei@@ den who belong to the fastest @-@ star class with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .

relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening , it takes place for ever , at night , the morning is w@@ asted away , in the morning it is far not thinking about sleep .
that is all others as relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , a quarter of adult sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and more than ten percent emp@@ ires their sleep frequently or permanent as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , and there are many different reasons , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , member of the Executive Board of the German Society of Dang@@ erous Goods and Sle@@ eping Medicine .
what one under@@ stands , but the in@@ som@@ nie , so it is an input and as@@ le@@ ep .
just the pier@@ ce find many people as un@@ satisfactory or in@@ sufficient , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht says , member of the German Medical Association with practice in Lower Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of ins@@ om@@ nia are complex .
inter , organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors can hide , but also medication .
not rare is the ins@@ om@@ atic expression of an other disease .
&quot; very early wake @-@ up is often frequent with depression , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß .
and it can be that different factors print each other .
who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can aw@@ akes every two to three hours , and starts to p@@ onder@@ ing over everyday problems and come to gre@@ et , there is We@@ e@@ ß an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is not possible anymore .
when should you sleep with sleep ?
those who want to sleep over a month stay in at least three nights per week , should not sleep well and should be imp@@ aired by the doctor .
the impair@@ ment may look different : one is ro@@ uted , tired , irre@@ voc@@ ative , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is slightly irrit@@ able , has mood fluctu@@ ations or physical symptoms such as stomach or head@@ aches .
in order to alle@@ vi@@ ate the sleep disorder , it is important to find out the causes .
as treatment options include behavi@@ oral changes , a cogn@@ itive behavi@@ oral therapy or also medic@@ ations - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - query .
in Germany , Hans Ingo Fi@@ mes@@ hes , head of the interdisciplinary medical center of the Char@@ ité University of Berlin , hardly emphas@@ ises it in Germany .
this is why you should first contact the dent@@ ist at first time , obli@@ que We@@ e@@ ß .
it can clari@@ fy investigations if the problems have a physical cause .
who should be in sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for investigation in the sleep laboratory , medical examination for instance with bre@@ aths with bre@@ aths , in case of canc@@ ers or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a le@@ ep , explains fi@@ brin@@ ogen .
it does not have to prepare for the study .
one should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a lunch menu , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ nets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after bon@@ ding you go to the bed in its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes in the body you bear a nas@@ al g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a fen@@ cing on finger .
in addition , a camera shows the sleeping area .
how can suffer@@ ers get problems in the handle ?
there are quite a number of positions to which one can put for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß counts on : regular bed@@ - and standing hours , not too long in bed , not to sleep on the day , do not get television for the sleeping , alcohol avoid and at night - then you will start immediately , and that &apos;s all and not eligible .
what does the jung@@ le camp with lack@@ ing medals in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has sold himself on Facebook to dis@@ appointing the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he was brought to gold for the first world championship in Doha and set up his first world record at the same time .

the conveyor system in the swimming sport is bad , the dim@@ mer control is very good .
we can not compete with countries that promote very much and do not even operate in the topic of D@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t tell that the controls should be set up here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wanted to launch a com@@ eback after nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .

airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ gage arrested
professional theft at the airport Düsseldorf
civil society of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police successfully accomplished the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the facts alleged as Ban@@ de several pocket and baggage ste@@ els committed .
at 21.@@ 30 o &apos;clock , civil servants recognized in the Airport of Düsseldorf as a band that was known as the polic@@ emen from last theft .
the two women and two men had been committed to several crimes since the middle of July of this year and were very professional and experienced profession@@ ally .
the specialists of the Criminal Code 34 can re@@ direct the Di@@ ving that went to Germany to follow cre@@ denti@@ als from criminal off@@ ences to Germany .
they took over 15,000 euros in total .
Alt@@ build@@ ed , a few links pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ id street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain works on the first sight , but the police rel@@ ates to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if you come along the road from east to west , one comes to play@@ grounds , a refresh@@ ing nur@@ ser@@ y nur@@ ser@@ y and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
someone has worked on the facade of a grey house . &quot;
compared to a Li@@ dl , which will soon be torn down , it is already being built : by 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain is missing in the last weeks , however , preferably with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason for this is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants of the rental , in the ground floor there are still rooms and are used for events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially the Berlin @-@ part of Berlin had several times a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; police force since the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having been cleared on 22 June , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers were pat@@ ched , with 30 to 40 officials and three Team wagons , closed parts of the road and held visitors off to enter the house with number 94 .
in the order of the renovated building staff in the order of the unknown house owner , rooms were renovated .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearance had been illeg@@ ally illegal , and a day later , police and buil@@ ders moved under the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ izers and residents .
in this summer afternoon the street acts peace@@ fully : parents walk with children , people sit on the brush in front of the houses in the sun , others speak pre@@ h@@ ight .
in the immediate vicinity of the skin projects , there are an elementary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main concern of many local residents : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , which has been living in the Kiev since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , which attrac@@ ts three children , especially from the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the skin projects , they share the care above h@@ iring and gent@@ leman .
it does not sound after a Kie@@ z , which would like to have a majority of polishing in front of v@@ and@@ ing left .
the tr@@ aben , the name of the Berlin interior , and the police between the house occupied and their neigh@@ bors , exists so obviously not .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was a traditional working district , which also has a lower average income and high poverty reduction in comparison to the rest of the city .
also house occupied and the native residential projects are already long since the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , among them almost the whole Main@@ zer street in the vicinity of the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer had been vac@@ ated under a great police battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ s and are inhabited by people today , who occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district is increasingly become a mag@@ nets for tourists and elec@@ toral liner from all over the world : with them , people from the GDR @-@ time and former house he occupied their Kiev .
this makes a remarkable feature , which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ s are attacked as symbols for these development : they det@@ ects them of beaten discs or fresh kn@@ itted fac@@ ades , which were subjected to colour wra@@ ps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other street was mentioned so often together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a reason that all the neighbours must do as a problem , it could not necessarily be affected by the crime : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; off@@ ences such as body viol@@ ate statistics , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest part of the criminal off@@ ences make property damages resulting from the newly built and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , which has been living in a rental house next to the controversi@@ al 94 , no talk can be given by un@@ certainty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what violence goes , it is most important : the people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bors who were dest@@ ined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the famous combust@@ ible cars will also give it longer in the ri@@ gs even longer .
for the studied Archit@@ ect@@ in , her Road is not a criminal point , on the contrary : &quot; here man helps each other , lives along the road and gets more each other than somewhere else . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consci@@ ously drawn into the Riga street - and remained .
that is why it was so important that the residents got their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which took place in July all suddenly the De@@ ut@@ ory oh@@ em@@ nity across the district .
but in the eyes of inhabitants like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to depart from them : by sending all new buildings into former building g@@ aps , which explo@@ red the old residents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that are in the last few con@@ domin@@ iums that are not interesting for many - here are people who are not so well &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction can &apos;t I be gu@@ ile . &quot;
but what shall we do if any man hear ?
since he reli@@ es on all sides , also with the police and the inhabitants .
for list@@ eners , who like more than colour bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiev .
whoever draws , should be aware of his - exactly like someone who is going into a circum@@ cise area there can be po@@ or@@ ly chargeable to noise .
all only with previous names mentioned they have asked to be called by their right name
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new Refu@@ gee
An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in matters of integration and organizer .
Moreover , it is a social worker .
since July An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ el has been the Refu@@ gee for Ur@@ bach .
the social education in support the team of managing Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees itself as a response to all actors : refugees , working groups refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else is mis@@ mixed .
Reg@@ ine customer indicates that the volunteer is more than@@ k@@ ful that Deu@@ ver@@ le now is , the ei@@ ving Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , which has a problem above all .
so , some - less sp@@ ott@@ end than rather much on the wide range of wanted tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
a managing director with a talent for languages and people , associated with many years of experience in the field of social work , just a well @-@ done wo@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau .
but administrative work is not its central area , An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le writes .
mainly we go to organisation , work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been here for about six weeks .
she has spent a 50 percent job on three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the highest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le Ehr@@ ing and general official actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and small issues , organiz@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
soon a new container in the wash@@ en@@ straße are now
a problem of problem has been found since some time , flats for the connecting pl@@ ough@@ lings , which have been recognized .
for the connection , the municipalities are competent .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented apartments .
the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities itself .
the responsibilities changes from Land@@ rat with local community and job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every land@@ lord wants to offer his flat .
the search have been very difficult for some time .
de fac@@ to finds no private apartments .
so far it did not work so far be allowed to private dwellings , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , the common dwellings must be not@@ ori@@ ous as it is so beautiful .
so soon new container will be placed in the wash@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
Per@@ spective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine customer and An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
in addition to a fixed stay there are internship opportunities , training places , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who have to be frozen or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reported Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help Haus@@ master , do @-@ profit work - and motiv@@ ated and very ti@@ dy , like An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
it hopes for the work to be a positive external effect .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
however , activity doesn &apos;t work .
the day need a fixed structure , tell Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer .
people would have to develop a pol@@ rig@@ orous feeling .
so it offers offers such as sports , contacts with loc@@ als and especially language courses .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
so also here administration and hon@@ our@@ able .
it is centrally located that the refugees get the feeling they are pleased and welcome in Germany .
the long period of procedure is a problem .
you need to explain the refugees that it takes it and to make it reasonable time , for example , with language courses .
those who sometimes feel the feeling , he could not work in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be un@@ profitable , who will never integrate it .
the distinct majority be motiv@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , problems are hon@@ est , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People are hon@@ est , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people , with whom nothing goes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always motiv@@ ating others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of you have been a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : do they have been afraid of radi@@ cal@@ ization , even in a small congregation like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what man@@ ners can call &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no risk could be able and don &apos;t want to complete them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sen@@ si@@ bilities are the hel@@ per already .
these inci@@ dents have also been subject to refugees too .
they had fear that the assassination attempt to bring them completely in time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to show that they have nothing to do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would glad@@ ly stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and community will need to look out in the region and in the region .
they always have in the background that soon a new tre@@ ad could come to refugees and mig@@ rant to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
this question clearly answers to answer the policy .
actually it is un@@ fair to set them away from place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived where we would like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes a clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher has also been bor@@ row@@ ed to integrate the previous man as reasonable .
these are currently about 100 persons , mainly young men .
but if people are in need , let one help them , they are both women .
the political world situation is so complicated , there is no easy answers .
