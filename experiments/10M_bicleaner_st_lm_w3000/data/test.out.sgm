<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps Business Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">In infrastructure and to prevent the Trade Agreement TTP, both Clinton and Trump are being used as well as Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are however, with tax and energy policy as well as in a basic principle.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in the economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to lead the doubts rather small and warns before, as the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton made the economy to death and regulate deaths, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">But in contrast, he would be different, claiming Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will restores massif massively, and he makes himself a far more tax reform with lower tax sets strong - for private people and for businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has made a disadvantageous opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes for the rich man would increase, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the mules, Trump and Clinton will say nearly that same.</seg>
<seg id="14">Democratic applicants also announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and will be rejected by the state-party Teachy wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump, so there could be partisan internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">More significant are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal plants and drive the coal extraction in the USA again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas to terminate the Parisian climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">With their investment program expressly aims to expand and demands: "a country will create the superpower of clean energies and create millions jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or the Americas," "" "I want to be there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, both competitors are not far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the trade of civilfish trade agreements, would not want to sign them.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time both the United States would not want to isolate international trade - but just US jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">Which should then be paid even better, is required by Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump I want to do in this question is not clear: once again he says: the minimum wage has to be, then he says he will not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the upcoming months is likely to develop the control policy of both bearings.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "on one side is Trump, who wants to spur growth and citizens to spur growth." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics hold him, so that the budgetary deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who want to ask at least from the rich men that they would pay more taxes, and their critics say, "more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of Foreign Affairs"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that finished a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce his hands and proclaim an official end of the eight months of war and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palastes in reception, I cannot realize that Ankara will destroy this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the rash, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin was a smelly smile, and he radiated hardly heat, even for his reaming conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke about his" "" "Friend's Friend" "" "- according to a report about five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he also promised that relations with Russia could not only return to their old level prior to the crisis but even better." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">On the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have been dawed as would have been something to happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed to be on the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's beaming, sustainable bolle showed that the Russian head of Russia had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather the cause of the crisis was the first, what he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was walled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin distributed Putin and accused Ankara, Russia in their back.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "this was even bigger because it was committed by a divine friend." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">To build up again, it is difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the state-controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed to bear the Turks for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">On serious, the accusations of conductive civil servants had benefited that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, who will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He fought this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg was the official message that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received his fault from the President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of an armistice is clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs first line all friends who can get, after the last month in a failed coup d "coup d" état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey had also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there is also economic motifs.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions are hard to meet Turkey - especially the ban of chartered perfuges that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by nearly 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel operators and chartered companies will be facilitated if the flights will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal onslaught to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week forecasted the state of television cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural exports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is on the west, since the reaction to the attempted power of power was considered a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">Along with this, the continuing Groll come across the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the erpout on it is to withdraw from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian government won a bonus that he demanded by the attempted coup d "état support for the selected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well known for Moscow to consider a self-understanding, which itself has a profound fear of regiments.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace at the sea allowed it Russia and Turkey, one that once described an analysis of an analytics, "Alliance of Foreign Affairs." two countries that feel off from the west and poorly treated, and now banned.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two still differences.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently delivered the role as peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support each other side.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be noted that after almost three hours of first discussions both presidents were informed of the press conference, that they could not say the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the president of Turkey prevented it on a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise this." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about it, where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of an open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, as the NATO member Turkey shot the Russian combat jet - it certainly is better to talk about the two Heads of State at least.</seg>

<seg id="4">Ross McEwan shared the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand were linked to the Bank's global ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Bank has since been distilled since then, when they had almost collapsed and saved almost eight years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">At this time brand, "RBS" was used to protect other consumer financial brands.</seg>
<seg id="7">They supported the international sport with million pounds to Sponsoring, from the Six Nations Rugby to the Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now she decided to move more national brands in focus.</seg>
<seg id="9">Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland but will not be initialized.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the IPB references will change to NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ulster's brand is already used to customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other, smaller brands for the private customer business that will receive more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEWAN was interviewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in Inverness-Shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "he divided the BBC Scotland with:" "" "the RSB brand will be at our investors brand as well as the brand, among which our employees will be busy, since we are now going to become a bank of brands." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">As the bank itself has been a global brand, RBS was a global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">I say that we don't have any global goals, but pursuing local goals.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will work in their own communities for something completely different and our staff will work among these brands with the customers.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that there will be six Nations sponsorship, and that it will increase the perception of the various brands in its sport Sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it's time for us to develop the bank of the brands, as we are concentrating on the inside (we've asked) to make this for a better bank for customers?" said the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago, if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think it will see many changes.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can start again this brands, so I think that the time has come.</seg>

<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed unwanted to release his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was a lot of years part of the most close trust of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed special envoy for environmental and transportation.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement of the Kremlin it is that Putin have ordered the release of Ivanovs of his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino who had been a deputy chairman since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated at the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the site of Kremlin it is called (on Russian) that it was later promoted to log-head and head of the control room.</seg>
<seg id="10">On his appointment he said to Putin: "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the most important role of the government to assist your activity as chief of state of law and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked him to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Persuade the ridious faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow secrets.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time one of the most close confidence Vladimir Putin and works as he for the Soviet intelligence, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigns at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the differentiation of the cameras, only few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a sort of power?</seg>
<seg id="20">No one knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who was once approved as a potential president, would like to lead to the Russian environmental policy - pushed forward to big skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, quoted on the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov said, "it is true that I asked you in a conversation, I could have to say that this very complicated - man could say nearly four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov received the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Bundessionnal Service (FSB), Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power in Ivanov, he called Ivanov as one of five people, whom he confided in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once was believed that Ivanov could lead to Putin's second term president of Russia as a third term putting Putin against the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this item was taken by another, close allies of Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister, before he became president of three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I'm taking part in the women's Olympic Centre and this is more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">I've been doing so much for the summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: this team has three tower, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdin is and Madison Kocian, which is Roman Cathokin, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">The USA finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has the black and hispanic female presence at the top of these sports art.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the past four years the number one was one of the female gymnast a Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year there were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is showing strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner in the Americas.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to be a witness of incredible performance of the three times world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as it was unexpected, but masterful Gymasticroutines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won with an individual training event for women gold.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won Silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We will see the top of this sport, but you don't see turnable classes in all the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympics is only four gymnasts in the team. Moreover, that is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is so that Turns is an expensive sport and Turner first place in private gyms that will maintain their parents, education, travel and hotel costs (for the trainer and their Turner and families). the list can be adjusted to the list.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these sorts are in wealthy suburbs, which can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these cases, Turner will receive their entire training and this is a commitment and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both their athletes trained since they started with the tower.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to inspire the municipalities of Aun, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an impressive and easier access to access.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my TurnFoundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">With my events we have offered free and affordable gymnasts in Harlem for about 15.000 people (mostly black and hispanic) and national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to provide high-quality gymnasts ensuring the possibility to earn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Developed strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the spirit.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that thousands of young girls can bring to the gymnasts and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is so exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" through the Holen of the Olympic team golds and thanks, Fass you motivates her way to start healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Minister had hoping to end the dispute over the changes caused by the adoption of a reformed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants, who voted in an election to vote.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt's plans revealed to introduce the contract forced disappearances and said that the NHS would be in a "Niemandsland" and every additional delay for people and patients were damaging.</seg>

<seg id="6">Only eight weeks still remain until the first group of doctors will fall under the new contract, progress must be made progress and the time expires.</seg>

<seg id="10">If he do not do this, it did not have the assistants well, that they are ready to conduct further labor measures.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw a slot of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates before, as nurses and specialized doctors were involved in order to grant doctors on the string demark.</seg>

<seg id="13">The BMA wants to be a better week remuneration for the 54,000 assistants that are subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Morning, Director General of NHS employees, demanded the assistant to terminate the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">Morning said: "working ampfle measures nothing of the only little, but already supercharged teams and service providers and prepare the patient, nourishing and their families just worries, distress, and interruption."</seg>
<seg id="16">During the past two months, we talked to me with the help of the assistants, and with the Ministry of Health and other ministries to the concerns relating to the precursor and of the Whistleblowings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The employer hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - how to return, flexibility in training, training courses, mutual recognition of apprentice, training events and gender-specific wage works in medicine - a sign that was the employer, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="4">By 2021, the Parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the severity of parliament approved the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">As a result, it is not so far off: summer holidays, heat, and land meals - that fails.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, which are to be convinced by the election, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of those vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are no locals, so no locals are allowed to choose the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: in the holidays are helpers, posters hang up, air balloons, flyers, and out at the end of the vote, only tired should be filled.</seg>
<seg id="9">By September 4, 2016, the election and last Ferihy, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to be just over the people over the past.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot stage, if one can say at all, has just started.</seg>

<seg id="28">Because much on the game, Sellering has called for its SPD now to a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind the CDU (25) and just under the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the 2011 election, the SPD won still clear with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination records: who buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men love middle-age records.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you submit to the commentaries, in order to excuse it under the pseudonym-Allesingle defect-aged men, this statement directs up from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the vast wealth of sound plates do not want to welcome to a boom in millennials that would like to welcome the realism of physical objects, but back to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a plate, are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely crises.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is not a hordes by Hobbies - it has an emotional meaning: older record tables keep their feelings rather to spend (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone to spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But agree the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">When this blog would be a news report in television, the camera would follow me while I abide in a busy road in Soho, a modest road in Soho before I am standing, keep my hands and say something strange as: "so, let's throw us a closer look."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart sojourns slowly on his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now fill in the buildings where the independent vendor were resident - there is a handful of fantastic plate stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera version to disable the camera for the next part, in which I stand in the immediate vicinity of different men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I selected by Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men's middle age) into Reckless Records (data number: eight men of middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess" he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4.000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed by him), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he possesses an such considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy boards, which he was released and again to buy items which he sold, when he was young and plea.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early '70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably was too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He is right to buy those who buy boards, rather, and gladly spend time to spend time and adds: "I don't smoke and I drink not much too much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my grid.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works with Sister Ray, believes also that many customers who meets the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and buy their old sheets.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the conversations which I have led, people usually have received their collection so around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy again their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to the record of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds to a business like Phonica in order to realize that plate stores offers a soothing community of equilibrium.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older clients participated in contact with contactless payments system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some turnaround fans are overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to draw back to the stability of confided mucels, from objects that were happy to use.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the colt of a leere or the property of material properties as a sort of comfort," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as collector so and I think it is so many people so.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "like this is a staff of a record stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people have purchased a plate, they have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The poll found out that 41% have a record player who never use it, while 7% of those who buy a plate, do not have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this point of the news report, I would probably look very worried while I bluish through a stacks of Bossa Nova Compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works in the sounds of the Universe (data number: three men of middle-age) has noticed an "trophides aspect" of the reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone returned here and said," "" "I have no record players, but I would like to buy a radiohead sound record, so that I can set them into the shelf." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is no big percentage, but it happens definitely.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive loads, less musically.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, which are only slowly cleanness.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I am clean.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores - Wild Beasts of the newest synthesizers and sextonal pop instead of experimental jazz drills from the speakers - it is good to see such disparity in the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks longing longing, but wet psychological traumata are difficult to conceiving hard if one is standing next to anyone about 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and considered the variety of plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a mannequin as a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">They don't deserve much, therefore the collection of records does not have any real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from one computer or other way, but the beauty of plates is... "it drives away with a sweet sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how I explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">During I give the ticket that Jeans-Hotpants watches me, I observe a group of young teenage children who were grouped for a moment to buy Polaroid Cameras before a father and his daughter to buy a crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase in a staircase of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics that essential sheets for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees her - perhaps because they are only pure decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to set it.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering the fact that every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and then some customers could send to the depths SoHos for more, there is nothing to be chargeable.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money, is the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as boards.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research showed that the results of YouGov agree, at least in plate business in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record business and in Onlineresearches exist, untaken into account.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard to school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday tomorrow with security not with bummeln due to plate stores of the Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they grieve the neat gaze of an unsecret, 30-year-old moderator master the young men's middle age.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at 7-er Rugby came in the final on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were beaten with an outcome of 43-7 in the Deodoro stage here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Fiji had a master class in the handling, Side-Stepping, squeezing, line run and roher strength to win Gold - their first Olympic ist in any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was hit by the non-bad consolation prize of the Silver Medal - Britain's fourth day - and they could well be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which she struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinct defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back at the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But there could be a 15-man team routed in the form of this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be for GB a consolation - but it is probably not - that at least one gold medal around his neck will have hanging around his neck: Fijis Chief trainer Ben Ryan, the former chef for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult way behind.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, they lost any game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This loop is weaving, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and stopped the GBS attacks in fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. at once you would run into driving buses. the World Series winner went for 5-0 at the top, as Osea Kolinisau, in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">At another four minutes playing time, Jerry Tuwai still put another attack on the right corner of which he converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly has the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A heap of Mitchell stops the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa out a third gate, but the Fiji had just stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the re-pfiff, and there was still more than one minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou Preferred by a further weak tackers of the GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the rest.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is so, as Fiji had been born to play the 7, while GB are still ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is so too.</seg>
<seg id="23">UK led fundamental changes to the half-time and ended the fidence gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the ratios of the first half-time, up to Joshua Tuisova ran after a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt on GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game ran for long to the southern sesulaner, whose fans encountered and dancing at the door.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playing approach Fijis.</seg>

<seg id="9">I had a bladder, the operable and the did they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been quite worse situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could be in the beginning of 2014, outside the season, could start what the interruption to a minimum, if that is the correct concept under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, therefore I had to go back again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing in itself is already a challenge, but this makes it still greater.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the infertility of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who had a nerve-looking morning to talk about anything else and to process his own fears.</seg>

<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, therefore a massive thanksgiving to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would have no better person for exercising or better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have no race lost in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even during the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started, Stanning and Glover had a lot of reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "Stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to let not carry out.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted to achieve a fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, going out and win the race, what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The pair will take place for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>

<seg id="38">This would have too much pressure.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of Trampolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late it is, there are the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a shaving relay change between competition and streaks.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, when the olympic torch himself would be a combustible rod, who is enough to protect the wrists for the Turner for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't listen to the televisions, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbors in the coffee shop, without having Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a female black with dimples, would be quite well-known to Prime Time, assembled by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if it would be a swimmers, Turner, or even Freal.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the Olympic trampolines around gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not universally recognized: air guns, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may rule it long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I could make modest arguments for my particular beloved, then leave the attention to the discreet Charme of the trampolins.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolines have already been a Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years was so annoying that many those whom I asked, did not know that there is a Olympic port at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional Ignoranz.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes for competition, it has never won a medal in the trampolines and won a athletes until 2012, who made it to final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are going to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians to share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampolinjump has a certain external side charme, partly because it sounds for the uncleared ear, suitable for a clownsschule as the for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert but I'm only a hereditary Enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has a humorous potential - the Cartoonful citations of his never too swollen salty - but also the grazie of the gyms and dive, which combines two sports, which it essentially combines.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "jumps."</seg>
<seg id="22">Trying to jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements (rotating, real and saltos) before they work on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "you will be evaluated according to official review on the execution, degree of difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio mutually.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic Vektor straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallions hoping to go further into gold, faster, upward and over, sometimes up to the target, sometimes back and back on top and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They are not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but in the television transmission, also another executive goal: the world or of the Olympic Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal oriented approach is Nobel, admirable, even fanatic, and it's enough to stir even a viewer at tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "but it's also what I felt at doing this games as a little effort." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampolinspringers is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A backward movement is not the target.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "he or her, seemingly heavier like an astronaut, go to the top, then back to the top." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Even here, a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no raves into the distance, only the dreaming, elegant setting of time and heavy strength.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition could only be in the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifying and end wounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the end as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia-Manie, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one who will probably see in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the awareness of consciousness can only be achieved by the attacks and the objectification of male athletes, according to the The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley expects his coming to air ring, new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of debiting after years of spelt under the surface is now exploded.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: Smartphones.</seg>

<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long while the biggest 502-centimetre-size.</seg>

<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>

<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to arrange an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals with 392 centimetres, the threshold of the sexually mature and his age with 156 years was determined, Greenland haired with a continuation of at least one and a half centuries.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland Callum Skinner's last evening in the male team of Velodrom in Rio for fame, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow had taken the anchor, who made his countryman Sir Chris Hoy, who made the legend proud when he stormed at home to win a victory of the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Four years ago, England claimed a shocking victory, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medailies.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after being held in March at the railway world championships in London despite the backdrop of Hoys only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the substitute of the Aner Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as an execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap that tried to close Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man where they stayed when they saw the potential in the villi, which now obsolete itself.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinds, Kenny - who won four years ago with Hoy, and Skinner continued in the qualification round, but in the standard rounds the New Zealand thinks in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap almost back, but Kenny brought the team to the front and Skinner.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategy change made a major part of the transformation, with the execution in a higher gear, to slow it down and keep it characteristic and especially Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when they were on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="17">We set up a Olympiad record in the final round and overthrown the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of Triumph 2012 on the side of Kennys and Hoys, there was a weak start to the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no appeal to English rival.</seg>

<seg id="29">This would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a apparently Holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister was born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">The cheese of Hoy equals.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part next to the Sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.</seg>

<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>

<seg id="37">It was the only medallion competition of the day, but there was another good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Brain Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The World Record, who won gold in London in 2012 was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, with a focus on safety and safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday, he had fought yesterday with evidence of the qualification, as the officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, the tomorrow continued and finished, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archisoon of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13.260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team leaves its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a donation to medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After an extraordinary depiction of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio went down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Again, Dramas in the background, as the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April, in the middle of sex and mobbingles, as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one sees itself the first evening of the competition at the Velodrom, it looks after that the legendary reputation of the GBS, which has been a perfect moment for a perfect moment.</seg>

<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a half-year and was more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was dense and bigger, it was therefore not good in hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was quite cyclobig.</seg>

<seg id="10">For a few Euro lovers will buy the devices still on the Internet, but they were somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet age.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, 20 years ago, the Communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at Cebit computer exhibition Cebit in Hannover as a "office in the western survey format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent to a lot: SMS and e-mails were sent and received, also by fax it was to be the Communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to websites was possible via HTML browsers, even so slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and a electronic calendar.</seg>

<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble from climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus could be treated with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists previously noted that the slow circumference of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the newest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin but similar atmosphere could still be slowly rotating.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model lit also the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably pointed out more dry ties than the earth, but had once enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and harsh faster before evaporation.</seg>

<seg id="10">"in the ISS-Model simulation, the slow circumference of Venus is almost two months long," declared GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which is like a umbrella, in order to shielding the surface of most of the sun.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought a history of the Venus that resembles the evolution that was suspected of researches earlier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide press hacker your ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmer from Erpressment malware provides specifically targeted businesses - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of malware specialists, Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany were 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months at least once, partially with victims of a attack with depresser software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, nearly 20 percent of companies have already achieved target of a Ransomware production.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims were willingly prepared by the perpetrators which are required to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their prespressions software according to the observations of Malwarebytes and attacks on attacks in the company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially limiting lion money is distinctly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we have seen an outstretched fast evolution of the damage software," "" "Malgenebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "World" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the maleprograms were still designed to send advertisement.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then discovered the perpetrator software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the changing to the company took place in the past months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware is working after a simple pattern: once upon the computer of an Opator, she is looking for targeted files such as Word-, Excel- or database files as well as to archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the Ransomware and deletes the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Afterwards, the software presents the demands of the presser.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final code code to the files you have to transfer the victims - usually in the form of the cryption Bitcoin -.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users can use the personal photo database on the game, it goes to companies around sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage causes damage, if a Ransomware is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenues by Ransomware, 13 per cent had to complete the business activities, in case of a case, people were living in living.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, multiple hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened with loss of patient's loss.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims," "" "does not pay, you bear only the problem," "" "Kleczynski" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to refuse to standstill in operation the requirement of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker turn again and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety findings of F-Secure saw the useable area and contact with the mailers and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a type of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You explain to their victims by chat as you can pay via Bitcoin, freely available support sites or decrypt for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And are redeemed after payments of a few hundred Euro, companies must have hard negotiate and five-digit sums to withdraw their data.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of potentially high and relatively risic profits from the Ransomware exploration, the hacker is always professional and share the work, explains security experts Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus-provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a Ransomware within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">The probability is that it is about three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their damage software then in the form of a software constructs to the real refresher.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits produced by the malware itself, advice and additional tools for one single, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars were purchased.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in delivery is an adaptive pool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The presets are then looking for further hacker to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So, in one of the forums, one buys the set of a crime and commissioned the software to install the software to as possible as many PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per infied calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals carry the spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that ensure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies responsible for the companies of companies in the Malwardness survey carried out to drill Ransomware by file-back-ups and scanning software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threat to successful incessation, the perpetrators instead, with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or quotations," explains Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This makes the potential potential of damage, depending on the type of data, a multiple of more than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">As well, the perpetrators could now take completely new destinations in the Internet of Things to Korn.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the hackerconference defcon demonstrated safety forter, such as it could get a thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the air split of a type block could be quite a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then instead of heating into the future a whole production line in a factory could block Ransomware, could also become a topic in the Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="11">The 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque value of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, his work is likely to do somewhat quieter.</seg>

<seg id="24">Two USB and an HDMI socket are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat awkward.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, it takes place for ever, at night, the morning is wasted away, in the morning it is far not thinking about sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is all others as relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, a quarter of adult sleep disturbances and more than ten percent empires their sleep frequently or permanent as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there are many different reasons, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the Executive Board of the German Society of Dangerous Goods and Sleeping Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands, but the insomnie, so it is an input and asleep.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just the pierce find many people as unsatisfactory or insufficient, Jens Wagenknecht says, member of the German Medical Association with practice in Lower Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of insomnia are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Inter, organic, psychological or behavioural factors can hide, but also medication.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the insomatic expression of an other disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early wake-up is often frequent with depression," says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors print each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who, for example, has a herniated disc, can awakes every two to three hours, and starts to pondering over everyday problems and come to greet, there is Weeß an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is not possible anymore.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you sleep with sleep?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who want to sleep over a month stay in at least three nights per week, should not sleep well and should be impaired by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look different: one is routed, tired, irrevocative, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is slightly irritable, has mood fluctuations or physical symptoms such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out the causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options include behavioral changes, a cognitive behavioral therapy or also medications - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - query.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, Hans Ingo Fimeshes, head of the interdisciplinary medical center of the Charité University of Berlin, hardly emphasises it in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why you should first contact the dentist at first time, oblique Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify investigations if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should be in sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For investigation in the sleep laboratory, medical examination for instance with breaths with breaths, in case of cancers or if you don't find the cause of a leep, explains fibrinogen.</seg>
<seg id="27">It does not have to prepare for the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">One should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not make a lunch menu," "" "says Finets." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After bonding you go to the bed in its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes in the body you bear a nasal goggles, a chest strap and a fencing on finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera shows the sleeping area.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a number of positions to which one can put for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß counts on: regular bed- and standing hours, not too long in bed, not to sleep on the day, do not get television for the sleeping, alcohol avoid and at night - then you will start immediately, and that's all and not eligible.</seg>

<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the skin projects, there are an elementary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many local residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, which has been living in the Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, which attracts three children, especially from the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the skin projects, they share the care above hiring and gentleman.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound after a Kiez, which would like to have a majority of polishing in front of vanding left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The traben, the name of the Berlin interior, and the police between the house occupied and their neighbors, exists so obviously not.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was a traditional working district, which also has a lower average income and high poverty reduction in comparison to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also house occupied and the native residential projects are already long since the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, among them almost the whole Mainzer street in the vicinity of the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been vacated under a great police battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigs and are inhabited by people today, who occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district is increasingly become a magnets for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world: with them, people from the GDR-time and former house he occupied their Kiev.</seg>
<seg id="21">This makes a remarkable feature, which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigs are attacked as symbols for these development: they detects them of beaten discs or fresh knitted facades, which were subjected to colour wraps.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other street was mentioned so often together with the words" "" "left-autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "a reason that all the neighbours must do as a problem, it could not necessarily be affected by the crime:" "" "offences such as body violate statistics, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the criminal offences make property damages resulting from the newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, which has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94, no talk can be given by uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "what violence goes, it is most important: the people in the 94 are their neighbors who were destined." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">The famous combustible cars will also give it longer in the rigs even longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied Architectin, her Road is not a criminal point, on the contrary: "here man helps each other, lives along the road and gets more each other than somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously drawn into the Riga street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important that the residents got their way back: from the police, politics and the media, which took place in July all suddenly the Deutory ohemnity across the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of inhabitants like Neugebauer, the road will continue to depart from them: by sending all new buildings into former building gaps, which explored the old residents.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "that are in the last few condominiums that are not interesting for many - here are people who are not so well" "" "says it." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction can't I be guile."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what shall we do if any man hear?</seg>
<seg id="36">Since he relies on all sides, also with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For listeners, who like more than colour bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiev.</seg>
<seg id="38">Whoever draws, should be aware of his - exactly like someone who is going into a circumcise area there can be poorly chargeable to noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All only with previous names mentioned they have asked to be called by their right name</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in matters of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">Moreover, it is a social worker.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschel has been the Refugee for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social education in support the team of managing Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees itself as a response to all actors: refugees, working groups refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else is mismixed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer indicates that the volunteer is more thankful that Deuverle now is, the eiving Wollmilchsau, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, some - less spottend than rather much on the wide range of wanted tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">A managing director with a talent for languages and people, associated with many years of experience in the field of social work, just a well-done womilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, Annika Deuschle writes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mainly we go to organisation, work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been here for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">She has spent a 50 percent job on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was the highest time," "" "says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle Ehring and general official actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small issues, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon a new container in the washenstraße are now</seg>
<seg id="17">A problem of problem has been found since some time, flats for the connecting ploughlings, which have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the connection, the municipalities are competent.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented apartments.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities itself.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibilities changes from Landrat with local community and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his flat.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search have been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto finds no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far it did not work so far be allowed to private dwellings, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, the common dwellings must be notorious as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new container will be placed in the washenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed stay there are internship opportunities, training places, training places, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who have to be frozen or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reported Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help Hausmaster, do-profit work - and motivated and very tidy, like Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes for the work to be a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">However, activity doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, tell Deuschle and Customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a polrigorous feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it offers offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here administration and honourable.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is centrally located that the refugees get the feeling they are pleased and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long period of procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You need to explain the refugees that it takes it and to make it reasonable time, for example, with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who sometimes feel the feeling, he could not work in Urbach, do not work and be unprofitable, who will never integrate it.</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority be motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "however, problems are honest," "" "People are honest," "" "people, with whom nothing goes." "" "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always motivating others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">All of you have been a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do they have been afraid of radicalization, even in a small congregation like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no" "" "says Regine customer quite clearly," "" "what manners can call" "". "" "" "no risk could be able and don't want to complete them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensibilities are the helper already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents have also been subject to refugees too.</seg>
<seg id="52">They had fear that the assassination attempt to bring them completely in time.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "you want to show that they have nothing to do," "" "says Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would gladly stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and community will need to look out in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new tread could come to refugees and migrant to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question clearly answers to answer the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to set them away from place.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach we have not arrived where we would like" "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes a clear that the Urbacher has also been borrowed to integrate the previous man as reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently about 100 persons, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, let one help them, they are both women.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no easy answers.</seg>
