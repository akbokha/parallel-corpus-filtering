Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not easy to ease .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and on T@@ ehr@@ an to dest@@ abil@@ ize action in the Middle East .
the meeting is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ states solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been cl@@ amped for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the continuous urban development of Israel , and casts Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of mind in the peace process .
in order to deal with Obama a deal with Iran &apos;s nuclear programme , the relation between the two continued wor@@ sen@@ ed .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu was invited along the invitation of the Republi@@ can Congress in front of the US Congress , a controversi@@ al speech delivered in part as an aff@@ r@@ ont to Obama .
the word was not spoken with Obama , a meeting was rejected with reference to the upcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call prof@@ iting Professor to have shot his gir@@ l@@ friend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon was told with a sh@@ ad@@ able voice of the police that he shot his gir@@ l@@ friend and that the civil servants would have to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb was important to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &apos; but long live and probably deser@@ ved , and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dead body of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within the house , the officials found the cor@@ p@@ se of Amy Pr@@ un@@ iss and a handwritten note that I wanted to cut off on a white block , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved . &quot; this was signed after the authorities in the letter , and he was signed from Lamb .
there was no evidence that he taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , in which he had already travelled 300 miles to the school premises , where he was killed and killed 300 miles after the police , at his office , E@@ than Schmidt .
Delta State University Poli@@ o Bu@@ ford said that University staff has heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has later made a full @-@ call emergency call .
until the end of the day , there was another death : the Lamb took him , when police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
a day after shooting at the University , the students and lec@@ tur@@ ers forced them to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of it what Lamb &apos;s motiv@@ ated .
the details presented by investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped us to draw a picture of a talented , but perhaps difficult teaching .
students told that they were free to participate in his lesson .
the police in N@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ un@@ iss died , he did not have history of violence or criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt itself was mentioned in a book written by him in whom he divided the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he divided his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they both set up in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teaching staff has 17 members , and many students visited courses from both .
at the same time there were some tend@@ encies to be problem@@ atic .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ avers , the Lamb praised , said , he also seemed too little , and nervous that he was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , told that he told him that he had to do with stress in the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb previously asked the Delta State University to ask for lack of health reasons and said that it had any other health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in employment policy of the university is that the doctoral candidate for the Lamb had been doing so hard for him to provide him for an automatic path as Assistant Professor .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he knows nothing out of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something at Mr Lam@@ bs Introduction . &quot;
these are questions which must not answer the Lamb .
after fle@@ eing from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs when he went to Mississippi from Ar@@ kan@@ sas .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed self with a .@@ 38 pot@@ assi@@ um pist@@ ol in the back of a house about one mile south of his parents &apos; on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ on@@ meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran still in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house but Johnson said that they believe that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew in the area .
Lamb started his work on the university in 2009 , 3,@@ 500 students in a city with around 12,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he completed his doctorate in education .
one of the long@@ time friends Lem@@ bs nom@@ ine@@ es him as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and fun .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and he was 20 , when they met their friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to play a guitar game for a few years .
he was the Women of Women then .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls had melted when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 , and in the Jackson suburbs of Bran@@ don &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ un@@ iss were obviously working together .
in the emergency call said Lamb &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage .
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the stone house that is bor@@ dered by a Ba@@ you at the auti@@ er movement .
the police said that the dog was in order .
the former husband of Pr@@ un@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who now was 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was completely destroyed in the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he has never hit the Lamb , but with his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and play blu@@ es .
he arrived Pr@@ un@@ iss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came out both on a summer @-@ mill@@ market three years ago .
later they played together one or another .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter is writing and sings his own music .
Pr@@ un@@ iss was a nurse , which worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak fri@@ gh@@ tened bar close by G@@ auti@@ er , said that he had ended Lamb and Pr@@ un@@ ite Night out night 5 September after the Lamb had finished Guitar and mou@@ th@@ ic horse in front of a rebel@@ li@@ ous audience .
there was no evidence that something did not agree .
&quot; simply a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were on the bre@@ aths and inter@@ ferences .
I mean , they both had a good sense for sh@@ ear .
Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first @-@ semester seminar program and specialized in American uni@@ forms and colonial history , Don Allan Mitchell , an English @-@ professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas , and was president of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday night some 900 people attended the Delta State campus in Cleveland , including lecturer , employees , students and members of the commune at a cand@@ l@@ light memorial .
Sch@@ mid@@ t &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt was also involved in the M@@ ahn@@ eck , while the University &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Amaz@@ ing Grace &quot; sang .
classes will be resumed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ ender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
reported Press authors , Emil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans , contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to contra@@ di@@ ct that the police had shot the emergency call , after he was shot by Schmidt , and that he was called Pr@@ un@@ ite as his wife , but there is no indication that the two would have been married .

the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sat at the Roy@@ als , and I perc@@ eive that the seat is empty beside me , and it will gradually be clear that Princess Diana is sitting beside me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for the upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

UN Chief Engineer , there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon said that his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria , &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of nearly five years of conflict , and more weapons will only mis@@ leading violence and mis@@ ery in millions of people .

8 Sur@@ fac@@ tions show that Donald Tr@@ ump is seriously treated .
some have tried to make him a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
however , regardless of re@@ public@@ ans , Donald Tr@@ ump attempt to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper p@@ ushing down , it has not work anymore .
ten of the last eleven national qu@@ eries have run by Donald Tr@@ ump into double @-@ digit area , and some begin to ask themselves serious , what it means for the opportunities of the nom@@ ination of real est@@ ates .
of course , it is still too early in the elec@@ toral period .
nothing claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ize that this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was given by Herman Cain , one of whom also won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he could fight in a general election .
but out@@ line groups such as Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth don &apos;t realize e @-@ umps and start their dollar to bring about him .
here are some current surveys revealed that the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary stage :
dr@@ illings shot values have been rot@@ ated by 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate business @-@ Mog@@ ul .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
in early August , 52 percent were .
now , six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers are in the early states .
a quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa showed that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters will be happy with Tr@@ ump as a candidate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a CNN pol@@ l of CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans were either &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enthusi@@ ast@@ ically &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of them will say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; off@@ ended &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he is the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; vs. 40 percent , which say the same over Tr@@ ump ) .
the Next in Enthusi@@ asm ?
Marco Rub@@ io boasts 21 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the choice of the E@@ stabl@@ ishment , would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans see tr@@ umps tem@@ per not as problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump has been widely critic@@ ised for his fighter and ins@@ ul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans would be critical that the property @-@ Mog@@ ul had the right temperature way for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first country country country , State of I@@ owa where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he &apos;s favour of Commander in Chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
yet , 44 percent think that it &apos;s not the personality to execute effectively his ministry and almost six of 10 Independent States say that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House P@@ asse , as ABC / post .
republi@@ can elec@@ torate acc@@ ust@@ omed to the idea .
when she rise their money , Republi@@ can Elec@@ tor Tr@@ ump keep Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked , who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a CNN pol@@ l of CNN / OR@@ C from the past week four out of ten so that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
it is a change since that time , when four of ten end of July your money came to Je@@ b Bush .
full open@@ er : GO@@ P @-@ voters had not the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans that Rick Perry will win the nom@@ ination to just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
however , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters can show a pl@@ au@@ sible campaign as pl@@ au@@ si@@ bel .
even when the Repub@@ lic@@ ans took up another candidate , Tr@@ ump takes almost every one .
some experts note that the frag@@ ile field probably contributes to m@@ umps leadership , while anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support spread to more than a dozen of other candidates c@@ els .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ on @-@ head between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump appro@@ ve majority support .
he pointed out ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points , ahead of Marco Rub@@ io 14 points , Walker 15 points , ahead of Je@@ b Bush 19 points , and finally ahead of St Paul , John Kas@@ i and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes it ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eurs with 19 points in a hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ on @-@ head .
a close majority of Donald Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ Fans says that they have made their opinion .
a new survey carried out by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters choose Tr@@ ump , they say that they have awarded their voices .
of course you can have a lot to change that , and nobody can really say , never to change the mind .
46 percent said they open the door open to change other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ umps is the most powerful competition at the moment of other external cru@@ is@@ ers , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say that they have formed their opinion , are twice as frequently used for tr@@ ump .
six of the 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in the matter of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump developed two months ago immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rape &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the immigration and fishing point was to be seen in the public dis@@ course of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are wor@@ ried that the bomb explo@@ sions of Tr@@ ump @-@ critical H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and damage the re @-@ management efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ Survey of Monday , there are six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans that they agree with Tr@@ ump concerning questions of immigration .
so as long as the migration flows in the spot@@ light , Donald Tr@@ ump will also do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fru@@ str@@ ation over the government climb@@ s up to a new high@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of Republi@@ can elec@@ tors , above all , is mainly due to their out@@ board members .
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mont@@ t @-@ Survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political view of government as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa - two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Congress of Congress with 54 percent , &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent .
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the most exclusive residential buildings in Germany
here in the Hob@@ bies reach the most expensive residential community - with a view of the Nord@@ sea level .
the street is one square meter of a building roof in average 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer to objects in natural history is limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means it is therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which positions one square meter will be at most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residence , one of the cost is treated like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Fo@@ kers has published one ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square met@@ al@@ ar@@ ities .
there are several tenth of a thousand Euros - per square meter , noted .
but good , who can aff@@ ord you ...
by the way : Munich is not an exception on the top .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream boots thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
in Pi@@ ra@@ eus the Pi@@ ra@@ eus @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run for two times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a lucky hit by Thomas Müller made the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at the Olympic Games Pir@@ an - then ran it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a so@@ vereign period of the Champions League season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have a dream start in the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; by FC Bayern and Mario Göt@@ ze .
the team of Trainer P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was awarded her kick @-@ off play in the Champions League at the Greek record winner Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere , thanks to the m@@ iller Double Vi@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and I@@ Y@@ id@@ ol@@ ats ( 8@@ 9th ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth Star@@ ter@@ success series will be the first step towards the finals on May 28 , 2016 where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola wants to get the bal@@ kon@@ y after Munich in the third an@@ um .
in his 28th when hits the Champions League for the Bayern @-@ Gui@@ y@@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who would pass a reas@@ oning of the World Champion as a reas@@ oning of the World Champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp L@@ m ahead of the game in the Kar@@ ai@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 , and the Munich held word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they presented a concentrated and dedicated presentation , without sh@@ ined .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus staged his youngest six home games in the royal class , among them especially renowned clubs like Manchester United , Atl@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund was also stum@@ bled here ( 1 : 3 ) .
nevertheless , in seven European ac@@ up @-@ du@@ els with Greek teams , the Bavaria refused to be the next sacrifice .
they were cour@@ ageous , however , in their ende@@ av@@ ant efforts , but often too imag@@ in@@ able works .
the attacks were often directed to the outside view of the link outside Douglas in Costa , which was in@@ scri@@ bed against the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller made a good luck of the right to beat out his face from the right half of the to@@ ck in the left corner of To@@ re@@ ck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute , the world champion made the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as the Olympic We@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Brown , struck the head ball on the Polish line ( 26th ) .
then , by direct acceptance , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with his knees ( 3@@ 5. ) .
though the Bavaria went on to domin@@ ate the whole game , Pir@@ ator could set N@@ adel@@ y@@ ang .
Manuel New has got married at the name of Tor@@ ke@@ en .

the WC @-@ hero has only given the green light only after the final training , &quot; said Senior CFO Matthias Sam@@ mer in &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , is mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided to move on him when he brought the King@@ sley Com@@ an for the tra@@ ded Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th birthday ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later , Mu@@ f@@ ab put another one on another .

who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth
who smo@@ kes , that is not only the l@@ ungs , but also the teeth - that lays a Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study close .
good news : when dealing with the risk , the risk is rapidly reduced .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth .
it emerg@@ es from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking dogs the risk of smo@@ kers should not lose their teeth temporarily , to reach the 2,@@ 5- up to 3.6 single times higher .
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
car@@ cases for tooth fail@@ ures are car@@ ies and inflamm@@ ation of the teeth car@@ es , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the connection between smoking and timing loss is therefore due to amount of dental infection in smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
not to be clari@@ fied , as the result of dying is also increased as a risk for car@@ ies .
people who list@@ ened to smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
it could , however , could last more than ten years until the threat to the level of non @-@ smoking , Scandinavi@@ an Thomas Dietrich from the English University Birmingham .
one should persu@@ ade people to persu@@ ade other non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained study manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking he@@ ats the lifetime . &quot;
not too smoke is fine for l@@ ungs and vessels and leads to our knowledge as well as to high age health .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population is prob@@ able from age 65 to 74 years old , the DI@@ f@@ E distributed with it .
earlier studies have pointed out that smoking ris@@ ked the risk of early disease out@@ ages .
the new long @-@ term study wi@@ pers the findings .
archae@@ ologists determine the Rhein@@ u@@ fer on rem@@ n@@ ants from the late anti@@ qu@@ ity

EU Commission proposes in battle over TT@@ IP of new court
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to resol@@ ving the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atl@@ antic Trade Agre@@ ements , the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversi@@ al private monitoring equipment for all disputes between the corpor@@ ations and states are to be replaced by a more transparent system , which clearly shows more traditional dishes in its function .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set a system in order to trust the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP is supposed to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration procedures will see that the EU states and the USA will select an independent judge for a new investment action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are supposed to come to equal parts from the EU , the USA and third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to lift against jung@@ les .
so far , the rules involved in arbitr@@ ator has agreed to agree on arbitr@@ ary proceedings against their opinions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months it has become clear that people have not trusted to the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work on an international investment court .
there could be any disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries for example .
the corresponding investor arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) mainly demanded as one of the major reasons for major resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbitr@@ ary dishes are critic@@ ised by opponents as a type of parallel adjusted , through the company loss buttons to pay@@ ers , national laws , or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as camps act the proposals of the EU Commission as in@@ sufficient .
they were mainly critic@@ ised that they should not apply for the negoti@@ ated free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German Economic State Secretary Matthias mach@@ ined ( SPD ) discussed the plans in contrast as major progress .
the Commission had dra@@ fted fundamental points on the reform , the German Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU Trade ministers .
the old system of private bit@@ ration was from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans for ström .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the European business association for Busin@@ ess@@ Europe warned against restri@@ c@@ ting the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pi@@ ge@@ vity of the economy by too many new rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could be particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises that could be informed , called it .
when the talks on the free trade agreement TT@@ IP ( Trans@@ atl@@ antic Trade and Investment Partnership ) , the Wednesday remained un@@ clear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been underway since the middle of 2013 .
however , the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally a framework for the agreement was to stand at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this appointment is considered not more durable .
del@@ ik@@ ater Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sits on the stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
in addition to it , a fli@@ p@@ chart , which leads to sh@@ y , recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen .
the audience , about 40 people , is nearly caught by Stev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells you on a number of places that he is recording again on the map , which menti@@ ons his min@@ u@@ ously and very arranged songs .
they were created , and what it looks like it looks , in his home country .
since then Stev@@ ens experiences itself as a wonderful creative Ir@@ rer .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear smart songs that seem to harmon@@ ically very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but at any time they could get mad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a ver@@ te@@ ous series : each of the 50 U.S. federal states must be discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in 2004 and near the R@@ hen@@ he river appeared &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; and there is a positive effect .

the album entered the US Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any of the most influ@@ ential music media in any year .

Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister
since its election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns has made public debut in the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister .
the new Labour President Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to have his debut in the Prime Minister and for the first time with David Cameron .
in order to set up the first of his six pre@@ defined questions , M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n is expected to take advantage of the media , probably its achievement is likely to be tested near by the media .
he demanded &quot; less theater and more facts . &quot; at this weekly event .
he has also said that he could sk@@ ip some sessions to sk@@ ip her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary testing for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s leadership , because she comes to his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the Tu@@ c Conference on Tuesday .
in the meantime the decision of the Labour president to provoke the commem@@ oration of Battle of Britain during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of Battle of Britain in silence , criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MP@@ S prov@@ okes and is at the core of several titles @-@ stories in the newspapers .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ ns verdict , not the national hy@@ m@@ ne , has drawn attention to itself
a spokesperson for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said , &quot; he had been involved in a respec@@ t@@ ful silence , &quot; and he has recognized the &quot; Hel@@ der of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ atten@@ u@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two News@@ night program , which have come to the Labour President to sing the National hy@@ m@@ ne , regardless of their belief that the mon@@ archy should be abolished .
almost a dozen of the shadow @-@ ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and they are called to differenti@@ als in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while fewer than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party supported it as a guide .
the Political Cor@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences may also be within &quot; stack@@ ing &quot; and Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns expressed its comments on the position to the European Union and the con@@ stra@@ int .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n said this Tu@@ c @-@ conference that Labour &apos;s intention to make sure to remove the whole idea of limitation .
hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions ministers said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that she was only toward the government plans , to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ .000 £ .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour Party , David Cameron , since then T@@ ory chief b@@ ory is over , in the last decade of the D@@ isp@@ atch Box in parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour President promised to give another polit@@ ician , says that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions for him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister of the Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ ally and that he will under@@ take both &quot; com@@ promises &quot; and the battle with resist@@ ors to focus on serious problems such as poverty , in@@ equality and challenges for young people .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the sh@@ adows , business leaders will represent him , if he cannot participate , for example if Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea in discussion that other colleagues may take the word to sei@@ ze , and that He was interested in John Ber@@ tha , spokes@@ man for the sub @-@ house to ren@@ ew the problem .
when he was arrested in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he would put himself from the policy in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per le Theatre &quot; which is often linked to the prime minister of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he dre@@ amed that he disappeared .
since she was broadcast on television in 1990 , the group with Prime Minister is considered the most important Bar@@ ometer of a leader and his position under his parliamentary elections , although critics have argu@@ ed , they had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require extensive reforms .

Met@@ cash launches floor Dis@@ mis@@ sal campaign for the fight against al@@ di@@ - fall
met@@ a tries to protect the IG@@ A branches off an al@@ di @-@ walk in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A @-@ retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million al@@ di @-@ invasion .
while the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia were prepared at the beginning of next year , strengthen Met@@ cash and IG@@ A markets with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand by ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am marketing and marketing via the social media , as well as Adelaide @-@ Show .
IG@@ A dealer and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as E@@ ish@@ man Simm@@ o from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , which distri@@ butes and sell tickets for the South Australian soccer league to faithful customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash further details of his defense strategy will be released on 29 September when the wholes@@ al@@ ers are deployed for food , alcohol and devices through their annual investors strategy .
it is much on the game , as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A cargo shops and generate higher profit mar@@ gins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
shop@@ pers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ or@@ ic provincial superior and IG@@ A retail@@ er have a much stronger market share as in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in eastern Africa .
however , anal@@ ysts such as Morgan Stanley , that Al@@ di saw twelve months after opening his first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states , and all existing actors , however , will take away mainly independent retailers and tra@@ ders .
according to a report published in this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley published that IG@@ A retail@@ er could lose 360 million of revenue per year and cash cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
these progn@@ osis is based on the ass@@ umption that Al@@ di has opened 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA , and will achieve sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the loss in the food and food market and the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s high fixed base could cost between $ 13 million profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , cash market shares in the eastern region loses mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey carried out by Roy Morgan in 2007 that IG@@ A @-@ buyers were the most successful one .
Morgan Stanley took on demand that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will decline by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 , and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told that Met@@ cash is likely to disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash spent it to react to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Meta has added in contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s , and food retailers globally , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting its operating debt in case of simultaneous pressure on sales and mar@@ gins .
the wholesaler being denied and investing more than 150 million $ in order to improve sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and IG@@ A retailers to improve their shops by fast @-@ growing fresh food and to deliver better selection of private Label food .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging programmes for Elan are expected and hopes that the wholes@@ al@@ ers will return to profit in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Than@@ asi co@@ kin@@ is is supported by President of the Australian tennis association Steve Heal@@ y
Than@@ asi co@@ kin@@ i deser@@ ves praise and cr@@ iti@@ que for his behavior .
Than@@ asi co@@ kin@@ i was one of the &quot; collapse damage &quot; in the shorter storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ gios and deser@@ ves his praise to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve Heal@@ y rather praise as criticism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ ch@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always called &quot; Special P@@ KS &quot; , rub@@ bing through the not@@ ori@@ ous engagement of Cy@@ gios with St@@ an WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA , at the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light .
in a fier@@ y qualifying match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon you had to be separated by Kok@@ ch@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice by the arbit@@ rators . Dr. W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have beaten us , and I should hit the child . &quot;
while the last time he was bad@@ ly seen how he hit a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cla@@ iming a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , was def@@ ended in Kok@@ y &apos;s von Heal@@ y .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth on second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup @-@ finals against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing which I rather en@@ acted me is the fact that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Than@@ asi , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said some little into the battle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket which he lost because of a hur@@ ry in the US Open , but it is not the first player who made a ra@@ cket of fru@@ str@@ ung , and I know Than@@ asi was good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has well done in the US Open very well , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative conditions of Harrison and so on , and I think he deser@@ ves much recognition .
he has a great team around itself , he has a great family around itself , and I believe that he was a little too hard @-@ treated .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and so on , he has never experienced a problem with the other players he is trained well , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deser@@ ves it to be judged according to his own worship services .
Heal@@ y also supported the decision to take account of the important gu@@ ardi@@ ce that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for all , but it sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term contribution to the Team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is entirely concentrated on the competition and not all around the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Cy@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said Heal@@ y .
and I believe that Nick has made a way very quickly , wor@@ ried about people like spring and Mur@@ ray . he appears in the eyes of the public , and he deser@@ ves all the criticism of his work under@@ stand@@ able . some time outside the lim@@ el@@ ight , in which he can only think about it , I think for it , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe of the refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency , closes the limit of refugees
Hungary declared the emergency , and locked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , and held it certain that tried to stop illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed on the border , while hundreds of migrants were involved in a ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land between Syria and Serbian officials .
people who fled from violence collap@@ sed for a unknown time in a land @-@ strip on the street between the two check@@ points of the countries and settled down there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations continued .
as a police helicopter on them , Mig@@ rants &quot; Op@@ ens the Border ! &quot; and cried out more against the hung@@ arian committed oli@@ lic@@ ism .
some sm@@ ooth@@ ed out of protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that migrants were returned from Hungary during more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be a part of the solution and not a col@@ let damage .
we have to take place in the next few days of discussions with Brussels and other countries , &quot; Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tur@@ mo@@ il of the Hungarian @-@ Serb border came to a day after the 28 @-@ nations block at a meeting in Brussels held no joint immigration policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ministers however , agreed to divide responsibility for 40,000 people , who would like to seek refuge in the shr@@ inking Italy and Greece . they afflicted their hope that - during the next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be achieved that the EU states would put another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some people from Hungary .
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit on Tuesday to discuss the emig@@ rating crisis in the continent .
but Hungary does not cast its hopes for an outstanding action from Brussels or his neigh@@ bors .
the emergency service in two southern regions suffered more power to tackle the crisis , so that they could accelerate the roads and asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country also had the construction of a por@@ cup@@ ine wire along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country , after having stopped a fence to the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even in terms of the competition , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used .
in the last months , Hungary has become a great deal of war refugees from Syria , and elsewhere in the Middle East , to a substantial beam and to the entrance to the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has however in@@ si@@ sted that most upcoming business meetings are , which are based on search of a better life , and not war @-@ fle@@ ets , which are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in contra@@ diction to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which occurred at midnight in Hungary , will make crossing the border or damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) high Z@@ a@@ uns , who would build the government along the southern border with Serbia . these laws also establish higher adher@@ ence to the human traff@@ ic@@ kers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation that was caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency service , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Z@@ olt@@ an K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still vote the deployment of the military service , which is expected for next week , but repor@@ ters reported in the limit of heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs .

selection 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s head before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders into a national survey
the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race around the nom@@ ination of a national level , but sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins on the floor .
Clinton has now managed to support 47 percent of the democratic voters in the elections ( 58 percent previously ) while S@@ anders is at the second place , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den who has not announced he will receive the presidential election with the presidential election of 15 percent of the presidential elec@@ torate .
more than five months before the start of the preliminary elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is fixed , which candidates will be supported .
but Clin@@ t supp@@ orters are more constant as one of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News @-@ survey , Clinton has lost some profit in a number of demo@@ graphic groups during a number of demo@@ graphic groups .
Clinton holds a major advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these jumps have been reduced .
your support for men is distinc@@ tly decreased , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points .
Clin@@ t &apos;s advantage of democratic voters under the age of 50 has become fully vol@@ at@@ ched , and and S@@ anders are now on the same height .
Clinton has however led a major advantage over the older elec@@ tors .
last month , Clinton , with a double @-@ digit lead in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders will now have a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the Democratic elec@@ tors of Ukraine &apos;s referendum , they would say that they would support us to Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some advantages and further 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
maybe not sur@@ prisingly , Clinton &apos;s current supp@@ orters are all thr@@ illed from it .
the views are more ming@@ led with those who currently support Clinton - only about one quarter would support it .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters will say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm , say no Republi@@ can Elec@@ tor this over their leading candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ t supp@@ orters in an open question is why they want the candidate , that it is the most common experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the fact that it is time that a woman President is called ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
from Clin@@ t Clinton supp@@ orter up her compound with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
the consent to the handling with the problems and the elec@@ torate are also quoted .
as the vice president raises up a potential for the presidential office in the Wa@@ ag@@ ger , 57 % of the democratic voters will see it in the races , although a third he believes it should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked for the elections , who would be the second choice for the party , bi@@ den is at the top .
by Clin@@ t &apos;s tags say more than half , there would be another choice in front of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides , not for the nom@@ ination of the Democrat Group , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s head increased before His different , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate to win the election ; however , this figure declined by 78 per cent in the last month .
bending with a spac@@ ing of this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as &quot; arbitr@@ ary &quot; has increased .
nevertheless , the question of what is more important at a candidate , Democratic Vot@@ ers call questions about voters .
similarly as in last month , there is no the only Democratic candidate , or the candidate for this elec@@ torate as un@@ acceptable for this elec@@ torate .
the Democratic candidate , or potential candidates produce good results in some important characteristics in the sel@@ ections of their party .
multiple products view Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy and well maintained .
in the three candidates , Bi@@ den cuts the lead with respect to the three candidates , during Clinton &apos;s strength .
thirty per cent of democratic voters think that Clinton hon@@ est@@ ly and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say that above S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have the opinion of him .
Democratic elec@@ tors of the preliminary elections are general also Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in compliance with their views .
with all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion from S@@ anders .
as questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and one server during the term as Minister of Foreign Affairs , most Democratic Vot@@ ers have been satisfied with their declaration concerning the matter and say that it did not affect its opinions .
but there is another story in the American public .
half of the Americans are satisfied with their declaration , while only about one @-@ third is satisfied .
public opinion was in March , just after the problem was coming , split .
most of the Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their General opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said they have wor@@ sen@@ ed their opinion .
there are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , with more than six of 10 who say that all Clinton &apos;s sight are worse .
although Clinton is considered to be hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy of the voters in total , this continues to be a problem for them under registered voters . only 32 per cent see it as grave and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than the last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of voters think it is not a true and tru@@ st@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote also see Tr@@ ump as non hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump gets good notes in the lead .
of the six tested candidates Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush wanted to be best at honour .
a majority consider S@@ anders rather to be hon@@ est , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 German voters during the preliminary elections are 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son returns to Donald Tr@@ ump near Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is located in the latest pol@@ l of C@@ BS news / New York Times tight behind Donald Tr@@ ump
to the two candidates , half the support of voters in the new survey , and others lose dram@@ atically .
Republi@@ can elec@@ torate still support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . supporting 23 % in the last C@@ BS @-@ survey , which was conducted ahead of the Fox News debate in the last month , about 27 % in the survey conducted by Tuesday .
but car@@ son flow@@ ed over the same period 6 % to 23 % .
the pol@@ l also revealed that , in demo@@ graphic groups , Car@@ son exceeds that she is out@@ law@@ less than Republi@@ can elec@@ tors with university education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Governor John Kas@@ per , with Wis@@ con@@ sins Scott Walker , is beaten , who is fallen in deep@@ est , namely by 10 % in the last month to now 2 % .
the former Florida Governor Je@@ b Bush , former Governor of Ar@@ kan@@ sas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e , and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Rub@@ io are located on third place .
the error margin in the sample of 376 people of Republi@@ can elec@@ tors in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week shows that Car@@ son increases in pol@@ ls - it reaches 19 % support for re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
in the most recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post , Tr@@ ump proved significantly especially in front of Car@@ son .
with a look at the rising of one of the last week , Tr@@ ump found couple of side hi@@ ber@@ y for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geon , even after car@@ son presented himself to consider tr@@ umps in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump in I@@ owa last Saturday during a campaign in I@@ owa .
pleasant outdoor temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean Sea is presently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak levels are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough to get hot water .
a bath in the North or Sea is likely to be a real pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
when no longer goes into the sea : maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea in this week , divi@@ des the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .
Bad@@ ge temperatures still offers the Mediterranean Sea : in the east , it even rises to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic Sea we are at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .

five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Neul@@ ings
nearly two years after a student during a ch@@ ik@@ an@@ ous rit@@ u@@ als in a student body in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , passed away , murder was filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PSI @-@ Brotherhood contributed to Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during one @-@ time admission rate in September 2013 , delayed their transportation to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officers said that he was loaded with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and was repeated , while trying to turn over a frozen field on a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , and he fell down in mind .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PSI leaders did not call for the emergency number 911 after den@@ oun@@ ced in Den@@ g and was a@@ waiting an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police arrested him .
they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes to change his symptoms of goo@@ dly and Andy Men@@ g , to obtain the national president of the Brotherhood to sei@@ ze advice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chief of Poli@@ o said Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this point the members began to hide and put the fr@@ ying of the bro@@ therhood between Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ o ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was not revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning on his injuries .
Den@@ g rel@@ ates to its head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s after an aut@@ op@@ sy report .
&quot; a lot of families were destroyed by the drag@@ ons of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies from 1970 every year , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents D@@ eng@@ s family , in a statement .
Bru@@ der@@ ships and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
an County Grand Jury of Monroe suggested a indictment due to murder in the third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
two @-@ thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with religious attacks and formation of a criminal organisation .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to do not only the people involved , but if it is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - this has been sanc@@ tion@@ ated , we will also draw them to the account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood can re@@ vo@@ ke their affili@@ ation .
this will pass when the F@@ ed increases the interest
a interest rate is native , and the house@@ se will be sl@@ ender to stri@@ ve , yields top fin@@ ites for bonds , and the economy will lead to a recession .
we know this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we do not know , how long will it take ? how long will it take ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the economy does not provide a low manual for the economy .
a recession produced just 11 months after the first Zin@@ c break and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when adding interest rates is often , if also not always , a factor that react to financial investments and financial investments .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have strongly stressed that investors should not concentrate on whether they begin to increase interest rates , but rather on the period , which is needed for norm@@ alisation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could say that all the exc@@ it@@ ement could possibly be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated because of a interest rate .
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is in@@ sof@@ tened by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; budget money &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a Communication to customers .
in contrast , we expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal heights , but still on a low level to make the se@@ is@@ mic shock that seem to be feared .
however , this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is a historical trend based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rates can make things for a while vol@@ ati@@ l .
once the increase gets , the influence is not as dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seems to be a tend@@ ency to increase sales volumes from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , reflecting the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank anal@@ ysts in a recent study on what counts after a interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market has mostly seen in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days after an average profit after 500 days , with an average yield in the previous six months , according to a recent analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , Chief Municipal @-@ Strat@@ os at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , in Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares ten@@ ds to occur later on the increase cycle and the margin is thus beginning to decrease .
rec@@ esses are a fact that the economic life , but interest rate increases her often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed must con@@ fron@@ ted with some conditions , which before didn &apos;t come before and accelerate the recession .
it is very interesting that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in a interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 census counted only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although in the second quarter of 2015 , in 3.6 percent , only a few that this will last and anticip@@ ate only 1.5 percent for the third quarter following the second quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rate with so frag@@ ile economic setting can be ris@@ ky and throw the question as if it is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have made all year round at a interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were addressed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could have an increase in this meeting , there is only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study every increase of increases from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing sw@@ elling at the GDP and made it very quickly after the start of recovery in the sh@@ adows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what the worst recession in observed in the observed phase .
the current cycle is far the longest , which has been waiting since the end of the last recession , the record was 35 months , and these have been previously 74 months .
the solid income was also vol@@ ati@@ l because the market up@@ bringing a rate hike , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than shares , if their strategic course change .
in bonds , the vibr@@ ations seem to change towards once the first increase / drop occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the increase cycle the calls may fall instantly , the Deutsche Bank said .
however , strateg@@ ist by Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to closer relations between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a curve of the curve .
highly tin@@ ned bonds often bring better income in such climate , although &quot; we are still expecting to expect higher income , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
supp@@ orters , Jones means that the markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the dollar &apos;s strength and the decline of inflation , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the view to stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
at short notice , the land@@ sc@@ ur@@ ve has increased , the cre@@ dible , cre@@ ators have increased , and the full capacity has risen sharp@@ ness - everything features the market when the F@@ ed has intensi@@ fied its strategy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in large and all the company will un@@ veil the major part of their business activities in the USA , of which interest rates rise and will be comp@@ acted to local products . &quot; &quot; &quot;
multin@@ ational companies with high debts are worse , because a rising dollar makes its products at the global market and as well as financing their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to respond to extremely positive , three months after initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sachs @-@ anal@@ ysts said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet companies have exceeded the average rate of interest rates in 1994 , 1999 , and by 5 percentage points on average in 1999 , 1999 and 2004 .
company with high capital yields and low volume at their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with lower quality each by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a great problem .
company with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , Gold@@ man said .
outside the pure stock exchange consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savings could see profits by higher income , even if experts of different opinion are how fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 ist a copy of Classic FM , says parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham
the Parliament &apos;s con@@ serv@@ atives critic@@ ized the transmitter due to its &quot; loser &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is not able to distinguish increasingly on commercial ri@@ vals .
he also was referring to the BBC Music Awards and told that they were only called The Br@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament College Dam@@ ien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Collins were the program The Voice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said that this is not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts &apos; to Classic FM to prove a leading parliament member and puts new pressure on the transmitter that it does something that he does not do anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the publicly known radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is increasingly no longer differ from his commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I do not use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it seems to be Classic FM to turn &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the BBC Music Awards , he was on the BBC Music Awards in the last of December .
the BBC Music Awards , which began last year , appear to be the Br@@ its just under another name .
so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples of which you actually only im@@ itate in the market , &quot; stated Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC Director General , BBC Radio , rejected the demonstration and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is far forward to his commercial competitors , when doing live music and ligh@@ ten@@ ment to the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will learn more about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to give new works on Radio 3 , new music and put new works on behalf of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really tell us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that har@@ der continued to work to eng@@ age the audience as it did in the past , because the British are less than classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing of the committee on culture , media , and sport were under fire to tre@@ ad the commercial rival to the feet .
the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Martin handle The Voice on - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media at an estimated cost of 22 million pounds .
see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and is not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall was telling the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judges - &quot; in a special BBC way . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in our own barn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is the next time an entertainment series is star@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to announce the order of further rows of The Voice in the future or to give money of the commission child for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales advanced in August at slow@@ est and black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month the lowest result had been recorded at the beginning of the record in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile phones
experts believe that the Black Friday has hin@@ dered the log in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping is drilled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost .
but experts say that there are now signs , the online sales were stag@@ n@@ ating , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are indications that online sales are stag@@ n@@ ating , after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG sale index , said it .
he declared that the online sales increased more than three years ago , when buyers began to sell off with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. home on the sofa .
but now it comm@@ utes himself , and we may experience that growth is reduced .
the Black Friday Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is cited as a reason for that moving sales .
experts believe that buyers will take their purchases prior to this event , which will take place every Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers to make their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer websites over@@ threw their computer .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyer could be fought for bar@@ gain , buyers will be able to hold buyers .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium took out that from £ 5 expenditure slightly more than 1 £ online was issued .
in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases is now carried out via web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online rather than in the fashion trends in the interior .

Brit@@ ons increasingly des@@ people , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe has a rise behind
this means that 200 more screening stores , which aim at professional tra@@ des@@ men , will be opened
simultaneously closing King@@ f@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q sales nationwide
by Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Chef @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the Daily Mail
it is said that Br@@ ush successfully pres@@ ets its hamm@@ ers and brush for the use of qualified Eastern European crafts@@ men who perform works in their home
if you are sent with a hammer or a pain@@ t@@ brush for a brush on walls , you are part of a minority in these cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Br@@ its are increasingly professionals to do hom@@ e@@ use jobs in their homes , the chief of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot; &quot; &quot;
V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , a new Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the DIY chain , said that a great increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , who offer services to low prices .
therefore it plans to open a King@@ f@@ isher , 200 more screening stores util@@ izing people at crafts@@ men and 60 sales outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said it wants to deal more women in B &amp; Q @-@ Shops , because eight of ten buying decisions in the store are met by women .
at the moment the men were silent .
it said it is necessary to provide the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single @-@ households to take more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores .
we must move it stronger to a balance .
in principle , half of our customers from women , with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a large role in the decision process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who listed one of only five women at the top of a British in the F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also changed its top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .

I / DO@@ B function@@ alities due to un@@ lo@@ yal in court
at the State Court of Klagenfurt , on Wednesday two functioning of the Austrian Volleyball runner I / DO@@ B have to hold responsible for un@@ faithfulness and proc@@ urement .
the accused were not guilty .
one of them was also charged with abuse of abuse .
in May 2006 , he was acquitted of all charges .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary survey was cryst@@ alli@@ zed that the def@@ endants were used in the years 2006 to 2011 , over which they were allowed to sponsor in their features for private purposes .
he is add@@ ressing the damage amount of approximately 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also charged with financial assets .
this fact was given the Chairman of the Board , Judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
the defence presented the defence to no means that the association was not a member of an asset management decision .
the sport worked only had ar@@ ous@@ ed announ@@ cements and the sport@@ club , which they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they invested a lot of time and money - the Pas@@ sive amounted to approximately 600@@ ,000 c@@ illing ( rd . 44@@ ,000 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we continue to do the club to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told one of the def@@ endants , the sal@@ aries of the financial accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he decided to take this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
containing all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money to make our health insurance security as security at the Bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the association it was agreed , you can manage the money free , there are only no debts to be made .
the addition , with the corresponding financial - the dis@@ bur@@ sement of the expenses incur@@ red until 1991 was approved .
hence , one portion of the presentation would only be limited to years later , namely , since 2003 when an increase was on account to be paid out .
therefore , the l@@ ump and not detailed bookings give the rails , the former Ob@@ man explained the processes .
the accounts and au@@ ster@@ ity managed jointly by the two accused , said the second co @-@ def@@ endants .
why the withdraw@@ als were not dis@@ closed in detail , the judge asked .
the association did not be interested in detail for financial account@@ ants , but it &apos;s only for the cancellation of debt so the answer .
when an initial investigation began in 2011 , an amount of € 120@@ ,000 was transferred to the United States .
the def@@ endant has been , declared the accused .
this security account ran to the name of the second def@@ endants and was not known according to the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
afterwards the request was not answered .
then he finally said that this is the best for the club .
if something happened to him , nobody would have felt anything of that money , the prosecutor took place in the room .
the co @-@ def@@ endants had been informed , just@@ i@@ fies the functional .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; claim re@@ formation . &quot;
why cont@@ ag@@ ation ? , we wanted to know judge and prosecutor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there@@ on , the first accused he had not agree with this formulation , because the association never had an damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All of you are all of the tail@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he said .
he said the functional , he never had a cent salary , and he only calcul@@ ates o@@ dom@@ eter money and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets , he added to the association € 1,000 a month and the actual effort , however , would have been much higher , added .
the accused could not provide precise documentation for the early years .
these are , according to a working test , in which everything was judged as accurate , has not been kept , declared they .
the second accused had also indicted for o@@ dom@@ eter money .
all Beh@@ avi@@ or are in cash , along with it , he had to leave the bank for residence to the Bank of residence , explained in his statement .
the main hearing is being continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .

time of decision on interest rates for the US music bank
the world ob@@ serves , if the US @-@ based bank has been on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for almost a decade the interest will be lifted or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists , who were question@@ ed by Reuters , found that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will still keep a bit longer and that the interest rates are kept on the current status of 0 - 0.25 percent .
it &apos;s a historic event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest set on NU@@ LL at NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach ourselves to a situation , in which a large central bank is going to leave the zero area and launching a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , senior staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is based on a relatively good performance level , trillion dollars will be added to the balance and generating only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ign@@ ore the less ro@@ p outlook on global circumstances .
it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the opportunities against such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
army cap at the Delta State University post@@ oper@@ ed debt
after the shooting and killing of his gir@@ l@@ friend on Mississippi in Monday &apos;s Monday , and before he killed his colleagues , I wrote Sh@@ annon Me a note to say that it would make him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make it un@@ fortun@@ ate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could declare it on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , stated that Lamb , lecturer in ge@@ ography and social studies at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning .
he said , someone was shot up and someone killed .
king responded to the staff of the emergency services to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I slew my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &apos; was in the house ; but he who doesn &apos;t distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably won &apos;t be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the lawyers of his name , but he didn &apos;t .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
as a police squ@@ ad the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ un@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to do it back .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the Not@@ iz , Lamb of 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killing his own life on Monday night when he killed him .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he knows nothing out of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something at Mr Lam@@ bs Introduction . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb believed that Pr@@ un@@ ite had a relationship with Schmidt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ un@@ iss of Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who testified about seven years , was given a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good human &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ er said , He and Pr@@ un@@ iss have had a daughter who is 19 , and they had destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ un@@ ite had her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ un@@ iss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , who had been identified as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss by Sun Her@@ ald .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ un@@ iss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , came to the Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she wanted to help others to help others , &quot; Know@@ les Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that in a certain point he called to say to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will not go into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police officers caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville , the Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran in the forest and killed himself with a shot .
he received a Doc@@ torate from the Delta State University in spring 2015 like his lu@@ k@@ ew@@ ard to the university &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group by
the Lufthansa plans to build a large group .
in addition , the Lufthansa Group wants to save a more than half a billion euros with a better organization .
150 of the approx . 1000 managers in the world will cost group construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new negotiations are available with the pilot license &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lufthansa is extending its corporate structure and uses the Euro@@ wings loss .
the goal of the real@@ ignment is an annual contribution of around € 500 million per year of cost and earnings , the airline issued on Wednesday .
among other things there is no Executive Board more on the passenger business in future .
the Euro@@ wings transfer line should therefore be developed as stand @-@ alone as possible .
in the board of CEO Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , CEO Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , will now be responsible for Euro@@ wings for Euro@@ wings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the re@@ location , Sp@@ oh@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highlights the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete in the future against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now the organization of the 120 000 employees was still complex .
the airline operated under the umbrella of the Passage of the Group , which represents three quarters of annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilot
in the tariff fli@@ cker with the pilot con@@ federation of the cockpit ( VC ) the negotiations are to be resumed on this Thursday .
that divided the union .
the topic of talks will be the retirement regulations for pilots .
cockpit wanted &quot; growth in a year with a predicted record result &quot; fastest possible results . &quot;
the conflict between trade union and airline carried several strikes in the past months .
background is beside the transition supply of pilots the &quot; Training concept &quot; wings . &quot;
it stip@@ ulates that the Lufthansa in the fight against competition lines is shifted to the performances of the Euro@@ wings .

Luke Sha@@ w by Manchester United can &apos;t play keys for double Fra@@ ktur processes
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double Fra@@ ktur of the right leg with the Champions League @-@ defeat at Manchester at PS@@ V Eindhoven .
while this is the left of the left def@@ enders to weep and exclu@@ de it for at least six months of playing , Louis van G@@ aal does not have hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury could be caused by a random attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno during the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and took up oxygen before being transferred to the hospital .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has a double leg t@@ inc@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moving tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then in Manchester .
it is aw@@ ful - a boy , who comes with 18 to Manchester United who is very hard and then plays this , and then happens .
there was a oxygen mask on the cabin .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but when you have a double Fra@@ ktur formed , the six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy , a red card and the susp@@ ending of a poor .
Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish the Mexican people .
van G@@ aal assumed that the Italian bit@@ rators had deceived .
they can judge himself if I say that a me@@ ar @-@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
a T@@ we@@ et to Sha@@ ws account is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thank all for your messages . words cannot be broken , as broken , my way to recovery begins now , I am going back again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
related to the loss : Manchester United suffer the loss of Luke Sha@@ w near the PS@@ V
the United States Defense has an additional inc@@ enti@@ ve to recover from the European Championship in France until the coming June .
Philli@@ p Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves that kind of injury left off the square , all of them are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate one opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg quar@@ ry , when Mexico played its Holland @-@ team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very worst case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it wasn &apos;t possible for me to see the moment .
the only thing which I could see was the ball , who had touched him in another direction , so it looked like if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels good , I know how difficult can be anything .
I feel really bad there . so I &apos;m sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken into the hospital - after a sc@@ oul@@ ding of Chris Sm@@ aller .
surely David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better knows ?
it &apos;s a thing to learn all your parents : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost extensively .
it may be , you might be David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of care systems , his favorite children &apos;s book decided to call the Prime Minister for the Lor@@ ax , which appeared in 1971 from Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , Mov@@ ing , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I love my children , because it seems always a picture or a message that we have missed . &quot;
everything nice and good , except for the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supp@@ os@@ edly describes the action of the book , instead gives a content of the movie version of 2012 , the new characters and details added to enlarge the fairly brief original text .
&quot; in the surrounded city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a product , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , fulfilled , &quot; read it . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el was loud and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if the text is not yet pro@@ ud@@ ly enough : the text of Cameron is illustrated in part such as the summary of the Gulf Movie Database , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a product , it hopes to win a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
even though he ple@@ t to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems to be a little familiar young , like the local environment through the cov@@ en@@ ary , trees of spar@@ l@@ ending , thy@@ me , sn@@ ug@@ ly nature , &quot; which is devast@@ ated in the name of trees , &quot; devast@@ ated .
most likely the relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to it to deleg@@ ate the Lor@@ ax not 20 times in a row a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokesperson told that the text was probably executed by Cam@@ er@@ ons constitu@@ encies .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the German text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons , but there was no immediate effect .
Adam Ly@@ th was clear from the exclusion of England &apos;s crew , but it is still heavy
to support Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , it is a difficult task , but if one has selected the cad@@ re , the UK for the tour , is a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test @-@ series defeat not on my card .
I would not exclu@@ de a break down .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks Will be less experienced as those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ les list , and the joint is strongly ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali designed as a Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown sized test on Test level , is an option for the attack .
in this good news : Adam L@@ th gets off from the England test @-@ test and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
the decision to allow Adam L@@ th is of course to analy@@ ze me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse .
in its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ player were alig@@ ned for results .
there was no question in Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , as - and I told it - players are their own best selection .
he would have prolonged the course of Ly@@ th a long time , but he had control of his own dest@@ iny .
if he hop@@ efully announced more runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , a further chance will come .
the UK @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his post@@ ure even if he did not get a good performance and do not sur@@ prises me ; it is especially a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test punch goes to set his sign is difficult .
Ly@@ th received seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton was 9 .
just Comp@@ ton got the chance to home and playing .
the only dec@@ ay , which can be raised , was that England entered Jonathan already in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex Hal@@ es came in , and he is a stroke that I highly recommend .
he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ cking player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season , when he scored 236 with us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , approaching us .
it must be at least the same chances as they received before it , but this depends entirely from the team of team@@ work in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea , run by Cook next to Cook , give an extra @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler to give up four qu@@ icks , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a stroke can &apos;t strike there , and this left @-@ handed is already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ l of Cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een is perhaps not done to his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
his former team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lang@@ er played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined as Op@@ ens in 2001 .
he made three hundred races immediately , and wasn &apos;t looking back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ re as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see its statistics at an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no great number of backup j@@ acks that lift their hands and the trainer have op@@ ted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England made some of the additions to the user .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ a , the be@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master@@ y .
he is one of the most beautiful fel@@ lows of the game , who is a wealth of experience , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings power and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international Cri@@ cket Competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes you can fresh new voices in the dressing unit fresh wind , even if the news is in line with the earlier sc@@ aled .
col@@ ates team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not be used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot was a similar break against Australia and i for my part I have no problem with this .
some are not agree but Co@@ aches and team users don &apos;t determine the schedule .
and you must remember , as in the players , it &apos;s their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not taken by a slight heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit Great Britain out of the EU ) could win at a rate if the economy is expected to take place in 2017
David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ exp@@ elled new strategy to hold the UK in the EU , will fall into trouble with every day , even without the election of the great Jeremy &quot; Is it Yes and no ? &quot; Cor@@ lob@@ n for the leaders of Labour Party or Tu@@ c , which is strongly threatened with Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their cor@@ b@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at today announced that some member states , so deeply kn@@ itted in different cr@@ ises , as the EU is now once and not always made up of its own fault , Britain &apos;s own conc@@ essions and dis@@ rup@@ tive contractual changes that they generally are not satisfied .
in Brigh@@ ton , however , the Tu@@ c decided at its annual meeting that it may not be able to end@@ anger this social protection .
we could also call Dave and Georges sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister Cli@@ mb@@ ing at Summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always around me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend who travels an outside Britain outside the EU neighbourhood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ Y us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and its short @-@ going ministers and civil servants have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or going . &quot; &quot; &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel told her allies , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the post before it looks bad for her , like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande can look on his re @-@ election or its independence in 2017 .
he is also a promised power .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alistic government , Spain left a left .
it is difficult to adjust themselves to the sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British to help the sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British should stop their energy better than the UK &apos;s leaving from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want to have separ@@ at@@ ist tend@@ encies .
therefore , some such ministers may not distur@@ b remarks , throughout the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s speech campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , thought my friend .

it &apos;s true to give Cameron not a free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the review campaign for a matter of matter how Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins ensures safe this .

experts Crit@@ ical Report of Public Health England over E @-@ cigarettes
asser@@ tions of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined themselves to crit@@ ici@@ ze the evidence of public health England ( P@@ he ) in her report over e @-@ cigarettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have put the load capacity of the data and put the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a story of the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month laid the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily tiny basis &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; at the p@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two further researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the asser@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; built on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ een , Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor for Clinical Ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies are based on efficacy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it told that the public opinion is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current estimate is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less dam@@ aging than smoking and are based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement from a single session of 12 people who have been conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multiple criteria @-@ decision analysis ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Decision - MC@@ DA ) in order to bring their opinions about the damage of various nicotine patch products ; the results of the meeting were combined in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ een and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting is a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously received from British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T concerning Public Health in a sustainability report , said they .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting declared that means of a E @-@ cigarettes producer , but not the financing that he is received after reports before the Philip Morris International company , they added .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not supplied but includes several known E @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also specify an economic financing in the paper .
some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco be@@ headed by P@@ he participated in the meeting .
the research work of the group &quot; considers a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most of the criteria , &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ een and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , no of these coupl@@ ings or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ een and Cap@@ e@@ well told that &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; so far there is no evidence that I could serve as a way as smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Wellness at P@@ he said , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already responded to the claim that BM@@ J .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifetime fal@@ ter dies at his view@@ point .
all evidence suggests that health risks of E @-@ cigarettes is small compared to the fact that we continue to study the long @-@ term impact .
P@@ he has the unique obligation to inform@@ ing the public about what proof of evidence and what is not , especially if there are as much more public confusion over the relative dangers involved in tobacco .
almost 80,000 people die each year on an illness associated with smoking , and smoking costs the National Health system $ 2 billion per year .
by the clear advantages of recent evidence that E @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by the smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should place East@@ En@@ ders , says former Chief of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson said , has said the BBC should stop programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival &quot; would give her right arm &quot; for hit shows as the Albert Square So@@ ap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to do the type of programs which are not sent through other UK channels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he critic@@ ized the BBC that they are likely to have public legal programs which probably saw from a smaller au@@ dien@@ ces to place the most popular shows of their Riv@@ ets and broadcast@@ ers like B@@ BC@@ 4 .
after the BBC Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he tried to contact me for six years at Channel 4 in his time with Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs publishes on behalf or sends them clearly by un@@ conventional rival , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus communication Committee in the framework of his study on BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the radio fee , what I think medium or long term do not keep for a good idea , you should not do his production at least on programs , the other do not make it .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve a wide support for their future .
the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , it is naturally non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programmes could be financed without subsidi@@ zation could be financed without subsi@@ dies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is a such program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , un@@ seen both own production .
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give their right arms .
I must see me as this is to be public @-@ legal television .
I did not think that this was to reduce the BBC .
Johnson , a business@@ man for series , managed in Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s fault on the hunt was &quot; due to the amb@@ itions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular shows of the BBC will give the back what the former lad@@ der of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ ri@@ cher &apos;s lecture held in Edinburgh in 2003 , shows that the BBC shows how East@@ En@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the more publicly @-@ legal N@@ or programs &quot; said to B@@ BC@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure quite the audience , but they can &apos;t discuss their tasks , and they can argu@@ ed them , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all of these above programs which nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window window where nobody wanted to see her ever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I challenge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions to obtain the best value of this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you think all that one receives a big value for £ 150 per year , but for people who &apos;s 150 £ a lot of money , ask me whether this is true because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 CEO David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , asked that the BBC will check its friction @-@ mission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to make up and keep them talking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said , just a little bit of BBC production , it would be officially classified as a education , and said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in radio - and it should take an example in public @-@ legal television viewers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of TV will show , and with the commercial stations to make all available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ etics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ at@@ odes change the direction from the moment in which they will be@@ es@@ ide with sound samples .
scientists have been facilit@@ ated with genet@@ ically modified ner@@ ve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ at@@ odes change the direction since the moment in which they have sound samples to have high frequencies used to the human ear to be heard , radi@@ ated .
im@@ pulses are done by the switching of mot@@ ion@@ eur@@ on cells that are genet@@ ically modified to wear the membrane channels that react to ultr@@ as@@ ound .
&quot; &quot; &quot; further details to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light &quot; &quot; &quot;
the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ ogen@@ etics , which can be used for ultr@@ as@@ ound to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle @-@ cells outside the body .
Srebrenica &apos;s Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of a day could replace the depths @-@ brain stimulation , an inv@@ asive procedures that gives electrical im@@ pulses to the brain of symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
wor@@ ms react normally not to ultr@@ as@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they were surrounded by a fluid containing micro@@ scop@@ ic air bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , found it , intensi@@ fy the ultrasonic scan , which in@@ filtr@@ ate into the wor@@ ms .
the ultr@@ as@@ ound ultr@@ as@@ ound scan rely on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and can be found in membran@@ es of some of the worm cells .
the sound waves operate through this ion channels and activ@@ ating the cells , which they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultr@@ as@@ ound squ@@ at@@ odes , chal@@ as@@ ani genet@@ ically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of its moti@@ fs will be TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels .
when he is ultr@@ as@@ ound to change the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ blo@@ b@@ schen and transfer@@ ed into wor@@ ms where to switch the changed moti@@ fs .
the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with Op@@ to@@ genet@@ ics , a ground@@ breaking tool which allows researchers to interv@@ ene neur@@ ons with im@@ pulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ etics might have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be sent to a optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low frequency ultr@@ as@@ ound tissue , may be sent un@@ hin@@ dered and may be sent to the brain in the brain .

8 golden rules for the life of residence halls
11 years ago , I moved as an independent 19 @-@ year @-@ old boy in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the stra@@ dd@@ ly smile that I have been anno@@ ying - and to the numerous , long@@ ish complaints about others .
most of all I have learned , can dist@@ illed into eight simple rules .
the entrance in the residence halls reaches from a slightly ner@@ ve @-@ driving up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is t@@ anned to ch@@ att@@ ing : people tell whence com@@ est you where and where you have lost their Sabbath year , where you said &quot; hon@@ est Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate you , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it is just one yeast extract h@@ ah@@ aha , I am in my room . &quot;
bre@@ athe it through .
help others to do the same - do you have any questions and show interest .
it guides the conversation and helps you to find out men who like , as if you would not speak , even if your lashes were in fire , and this fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people leave .
the rooms of people often walk through drinks @-@ recipes , film night venues and public meeting points , but they are also the places where people are clothed with under@@ wear and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
related to : don &apos;t you think to start at the University with a relationship
Intro@@ duc@@ ted a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a de@@ fug@@ ium , but many student resi@@ den@@ ers form a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ m@@ um@@ mel culture , the friendly and soci@@ ally and that can lead life @-@ long friendship .
this could be Hell for someone who tries to recover themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing can tell you : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like to tell you , and I want that our friendship goes on , but you have to go back to the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a score by soci@@ al@@ izing is exhau@@ sted - and send it a SMS instead of kno@@ ck .
A@@ pro@@ po@@ s fl@@ ashed : do you do it .
a guy in my student halls had the idea that an un@@ closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
ad@@ joining friendship with baking .
since you start the university on the cli@@ max of back @-@ Man@@ y , the clo@@ p on the doors of man , to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less o@@ dd@@ ly than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I smile , when I smile you can give you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade ch@@ ill@@ eries are a good way to close Friend@@ ship .
your roommate is committed to keep himself and become , perhaps , your face will be associated with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are an independent bakery .
po@@ or@@ ly mixed cl@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat can keep people sleeping , if they are s@@ oo@@ king .
food to steal , is an essential crime in student residence halls .
of course , the h@@ oo@@ fs of chick@@ ens is a theft , but is it necessary to take a few drops for your tea ?
check that with the dairy farm .
the chances are good that they can say themselves , even if they cook in the inside .
if any need steal your things , this is anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my fellow resident who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent that added to their milk to pun@@ ish th@@ ieves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make noise , the people from sleep or work .
it &apos;s not only because a temporary man must be , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the word to men who sit in the glass .
a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neigh@@ bors , if they do something wrong , Dr@@ um &amp; Bass somewhat qui@@ eter , because there was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and it had a test in the morning .
they responded to this with still li@@ ve@@ able music .
when they had at 5 o &apos;clock finally , they would kin@@ dly take their neigh@@ bor to sleep for two hours before she completed their own music , shut up her door and went down to their three @-@ hour test .
would it not be romantic if your future wife partner would go to the same student residence by chance ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vice vers@@ a , it would not be ab@@ ra@@ dically , if you do a fellow resident for your future wife , they must go again and do you bring them to experience every day and perhaps to bring them together as they all shared friends ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot blend is definitely not your future wife partner , try at least to talk about your under@@ wear a little reason .
in the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone has left his key in its not closed room , the limit is between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing kn@@ it , than it seems .
a good way is funny , but it will only take eyes , until he becomes a bum@@ per .
get through plug@@ ging a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never try someone &apos;s room with t@@ ooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you will then put in the freezer - but drives their owners at the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , solo @-@ looking , Ger@@ ing@@ f@@ dien@@ ne

so approximately for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need a dream of living space , but also the mother &apos;s mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ dien@@ ne . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to conveniently be favourable and building products today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the interview
thousands of refugees are projected on the housing market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner has to know how quickly counted living space can be created , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , a lot of refugees are gathering on the housing market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the considerable accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms have no sustainability .
for people stay at a great part here .
over the stream of refugees we need sufficient air hab@@ itat in the next decades .
a very ban@@ ales , three @-@ storey tow@@ n@@ house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a tow@@ n@@ house needs at least square .
it facilitates the integration .
this is different if people merge onto living blocks .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three units of asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be a lot of refugees to say , it is peace , I go back .
then the houses can be converted easily according to the individual needs .
how high are the cost ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is valued at 184 000 euros , without property .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
that is appropriate .
are the construction regulations defin@@ ite their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I have legally treated my project correctly .
especially complicated it makes it the above D@@ amo@@ cl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the slot regulations .
cre@@ ep@@ y in the heart .
there will still be three apartments in one row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the local people react to their terra@@ ced house ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were which accused me to create luxury houses for asylum seek@@ ers .
which is definitely not right .
but do you not provoke the competitors for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true in the last five years we had a building boom in Germany , but they were luxury apartments that hardly can aff@@ ord any more .
my project has the message , even normal people need living room .
not only a refugees , but also the mother &apos;s only mother or the sc@@ ing@@ ing @-@ dien@@ ces .
I show how to conveniently build and install today .
that is why it comes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by selecting the app to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , you will find the phone the option to download and then install .
some are kno@@ cked after installation , since they get an error message that informs the &quot; software update &quot; is missing . &quot;
to handle the problem , users are advised to wait either until the ons@@ don or try to upgrade to iTunes .
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
this may possibly do the del@@ etion of apps to create enough - but Apple has done this due to the evidence of the updates . as well , it will be easier to delete them , if you have a special tool to install apps once the process is completed .
it &apos;s worth to ensure that your cell phone is charging during the update , or is located near a charger , so that the battery is loaded .
if the cargo is too low , Apple is no longer that the update will continue , since the phone may turn off on half way and lead to a break@@ down of the updates .

Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from the left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ t@@ ausen .
furthermore , Sam@@ t@@ utor Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Economic Development in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwartz and As@@ endor@@ ff Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places on the country , doctors - As@@ endorf is responsible : there , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Fel@@ t@@ ausen on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ t@@ ausen , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is standing for his successor to the next few months with his successor to the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice again on 12th October until then he was invested 3@@ 10000 Euro to the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympath@@ y at first sight , when the rock climbing upwards was taken before years Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who is currently taking up their specialist training at the Golden Hospital and who wants to come into practice again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the m@@ iller gu@@ ards good in this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ om@@ ausen and laugh@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
... &quot; as far as it was , I simply called them . &quot;
the couple of Müller was pleased to announce its own practice in the future at As@@ endorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and permanent contact to the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to know and accompany the families of the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also see his own b@@ oss .
and so one was wonder@@ ing , the m@@ iller bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to stay in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there &apos;s two @-@ fold family @-@ grand@@ father Frank Müller also grew up with his medical studies in Hanover , followed by several physician offices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg and Rot@@ enburg .
at the moment he works as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was appointed head office in Di@@ ep@@ wood in 2009 and is engaged as a volunteer in the DRC @-@ will@@ ing@@ ness of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen .

during the sur@@ geon , Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ed@@ ausen works as a physician , has specialized his wife Ur@@ sel ( inter@@ ni@@ st@@ ine ) on the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the m@@ iller , both inter@@ ne@@ es , want to be moved as domestic animals .
&quot; the End@@ os@@ copy comes out therefore , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after converting the rooms will be modern look .
we will offer more ultrasonic investigation as well as long @-@ term - and load @-@ EK@@ GS , and need a talk @-@ room more .
Moreover , the ED@@ V is completely renovated .
an allowance of 50000 Euro get the fee as part of a funding programme from the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; that shows how pro@@ ud@@ ly and happy we are , that the practice will continue , &quot; emphas@@ ises French gener@@ alist Bernd Bor@@ mann .
about 2000 patients are present according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , each quarter in the practice of rock stops , in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another practice practice .
a positive effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the Phar@@ m@@ acy remains at the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lowship ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor had been found , it would be gone too .
who , who , wanted to visit the fel@@ ong speech , will continue to be in familiar faces : assume the seven medical professionals and the cleaning force of the rim .
with their f@@ arewell in As@@ endorf the era ended , after all the medical profession is pract@@ ised there for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; reminds of Ur@@ sel Fel@@ t@@ ausen .
a little folding void after the long time already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and often will see many patients safely , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the inter@@ ni@@ st@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband compl@@ ements : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; so far , I pressed in front of gar@@ dening , now it could be different . &quot;
furthermore , the couple got two grand@@ sons and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , the border controls will also be exposed to our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Secretary of State Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border will remain parallel in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that everyone who wants to put an asylum request can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; naturally also &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the people &apos;s supply and security are fore@@ ground .
clearly , however , &quot; that it takes significant signals , &quot; said the woman .
people must know that we don &apos;t accept bound@@ less migration flows , not beyond the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia is ref@@ using
the Croatian government had previously reported , also Slovenia wants to continue travelling in the direction of Austria and Germany , under circumstances of cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
not so , this was the Minister of Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ fl@@ es Z@@ ni@@ dar in L@@ ai@@ bach however .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely in@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia will rather be the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia was already controlled as an external limit for the Sch@@ engen area .
as the Minister @-@ President stressed , Sloven@@ ian wants to un@@ lock the borders for refugees but un@@ locks .
&quot; each EU member must fill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ ba@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian government told , the first refugees had already attempted to travel in the night hours to Tuesday , in eastern Croatian on the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police opened them in the near @-@ fields of corn .
according to local media , police vehicles since then served as a police car with new refugees since then .
it was predominantly with Syrians and soldiers , among them many women and children .
the Res@@ cue services also and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country with approximately 4,000 refugees said internal affairs , Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Moreover , the buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo was brought to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian Serbian border to have led migrants to Croatia in the direction of Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian news on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade suffered , however , that it is the way to initi@@ ate people with certain routes : &quot; neither can we do this , nor we want it to do this . &quot;
according to media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees at the Serbian border town S@@ id arrived in the morning , in the run of the day further buses were expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the way through Serbia all the night , some 500 kilometres away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has added , so we told us that we should go there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria continuing to go to Germany .
so it could actually be the predicted post@@ pon@@ ement of the past Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Minister of Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously emphas@@ ised that his country prepared corresponding plans for the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; details he called not , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Sch@@ engen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you carry out rig@@ orous controls to qualify for membership in the Sch@@ engen area .
since 2007 Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partner country has a good testimony which concerns the standard of border controls .
on this page , about 300 refugees continue behind the Hungarian border @-@ au@@ n .
according to the media reports they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing hor@@ g@@ os and back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blo@@ cked .
whether the remaining refugees continue to go on to the Croatian border is un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister for Interior Minister Neb@@ oj@@ sa Stef@@ anovic was still present on Wednesday at a local degree in Hor@@ g@@ os : there is the debates on Alternative Direc@@ tions of Refu@@ ge@@ es , after the Hungarian border is closed now , for delayed .
it would not currently act for a very high number of refugees .
they could not say , if they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or other country .
hel@@ per rates migrants too - hazardous and Alternative items
however , private tour workers have already begun to distribute the refugees maps on which alternative routes are due to Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area there is still 20 years after the end of Croatia , there is still no more spacious min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance in the border region was sent .
h@@ ack@@ ers H@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay USD 30 million
Sup@@ é@@ on ok is to have heard a ring of Cyber@@ crime , which is accused of being un@@ released in 2010 into still un@@ published financial reports and press releases on sites such as business Wire , marketing and PR News@@ wire .
with the explo@@ ited information , Insider transactions should be made to the financial markets .
in this way , the investig@@ ators were e@@ unded to a total of over 100 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside of our borders may be captured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SEC message &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

they monitor the two stations of the Mannheim garage at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
hold the city street .
pow@@ dery , pr@@ one life with wonderful autumn sunny days and in the middle four large boards each with the inscription &quot; Before I die &quot; ....
the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ic@@ ul@@ aid did attention to its 20 year anniversary with this promotion , and is absolutely con@@ fron@@ ted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city , and under the men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical Hospit@@ als help stands the passages as well as for questions and talks like the volunteer hel@@ pers .
while some sort of spontaneous dro@@ pping onto the cra@@ yon and the set for &quot; my life &quot; may be read , &quot; &quot; &quot; with the way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not long suffer , &quot; continue to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and go on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
again , on the fr@@ inge of discussions about the action began to develop , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only if I real@@ ise that at the end of this world , I can live for me , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic plant , Mannheim , with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carriers of the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical Hospit@@ als .
hence , this is a public impact on the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
that not everyone may add to the tables publicly , would be comprehen@@ sible , but finally , it was a very personal thing .
the theme of death and dying is still adher@@ ed to as recently as tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , who have just contributed much to the Hospit@@ aller movement in recent years , to open the people .
a ass@@ essing , the Angel@@ ika Go@@ bl@@ roid cre@@ ed .
the death and trau@@ ent@@ ator att@@ endant belongs to the hon@@ our@@ able employees in the first hour .
as a personal experiment with the subject , it read so much literature and decided to eng@@ age in death re@@ medy .
when the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical Hospit@@ als which were informed by call guests , they immediately reported immediately , and had been with our establishment in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ ati@@ al belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the suffer@@ ers and depend@@ ents of private households , hospitals , and care centres and Hos@@ pi@@ z Sankt Vincent .
they are all carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ensive allows good experience and experiences with their mission and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see the life of another war@@ ts , hold it for precious and reck@@ oning the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tender offer of the ambul@@ atory E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hospit@@ als Service is free and free of charge .
the financial support of the health insur@@ ers and donations from depend@@ ents and funds provides training as well as training and supervision of death and trau@@ ma .
all two years training courses are offered for new employees .
the plates described on Saturday are now shown in the house of the Evangelical Church ( M1 , 1a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial prospects for 2016 reduced
F@@ ed@@ Ex dis@@ covers appoint@@ ments for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant sen@@ ed his winning view to a whole year due to a weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in his goods transport service .
the company also said that it plans to work about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for vacation .
at this time , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to take 50,000 seasonal workers for the vacation period .
the share came to over 2.5 per cent at the time of the market , 45 minutes before the opening of the market .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said that they earn $ 10,@@ 40 and € 10,@@ 90 in the financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 cent less than the previous forecast .
anal@@ ysts anticip@@ ate a survey of fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view will be effective despite the price increases , an average of 4.9 percent and effective on 4 January , and despite higher supplements for goods transport of heavy and large pack@@ ets that will be collected from November .
the company said that it is likely to increase the earnings compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and due to growth in online trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith states that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid yields , if you seem to be weaker as expected economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for vac@@ ations were announced a day later than half of the Rival UPS , who plans to recru@@ it 9@@ 0,000 - 9@@ 5,000 of additional workforce , equivalent to the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex has ended $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than last year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research looked before anal@@ ysts .
its sales rose 5 percent to 12,@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks anticipated that anal@@ ysts expected 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has given up a decline in international priority mail over the last few years , which made sales in its unit Express shipment .
but the boom in the online shopping has increased the results for F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
during the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat for greater packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result decreased to higher labor costs in the cargo business .
at the market trade , approximately one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , at 15@@ 0.15 $ .
it closed Tuesday with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
during the most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ist spent two days this week around a 27 @-@ minute Honduras @-@ Mah@@ og@@ any @-@ Table , to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade to lift the tail .
there is a mur@@ al in the United States at the end of the sealed , double @-@ storey seat .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should place the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has held a double @-@ fold order from the Congress : maximum of US employment and prices are stable here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed Leader have recognised that there is an un@@ affected third mandate ; financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision to make them pre@@ limin@@ aries . it is announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to become acc@@ ust@@ omed by an unprecedented interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that they could be solid , the latest tur@@ bul@@ ence could make an outstanding hit in the global financial markets , to increase these Vol@@ at@@ ility by raising the interest rate to Bundes@@ an@@ bonds , and is also only by one quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in first line will be the most important of what they watch , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the Mak@@ ler@@ haus Sti@@ fel &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text , the interest rate should not increase the interest rate , the increased un@@ certainty is enough to wait around the global market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no account of what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists who recently been survey@@ ed from Bloom@@ berg have predicted this week announced this week .
however the financial markets are expecting a wait of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that indicates a 30 % chance to increase .
this indicates a drop in the share market , in case the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists are mil@@ ked to mil@@ king , by speaking , it is further increasing .
on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial median value of 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or up 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
this action was caused by expectations that the F@@ ed Policy has maintained the set in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if they do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have to go well in their declaration to calm the financial markets , so that they don &apos;t fall into pan@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a interest rate would be calm the financial markets , because they will deal with the un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed will act will eliminate .
still before a month , the F@@ ed seemed good to increase the set by 0.25 points in this month , the first small step in a slow fusion of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
in the spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen had said that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be necessary to raise an increase of proposition .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ down , the improvement on the labour market was solid in this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the levels that watches the F@@ ed as full @-@ employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
although it ran down under the central target of 2 % of the Central Bank , F@@ ed representatives told that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the stress on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Shepher@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world gathered together at the end of the last month after China had rec@@ alled its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Average Value died in May by more than 16 % under its maximum , while investors were afraid that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would have significant growth in the Chinese economy .
the market has recovered a little time in this month , the Dow makes up nearly 10 % below the High in May .
for F@@ ed representatives , influence the market tur@@ bul@@ ence influence the complex calculation when one should increase interest .
&quot; if the events in financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US music bank .
now he predic@@ ts that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better in their grip .
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty that will be the effects of the US economy , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is none of the main subjects of the F@@ ed , hence it should not be involved in their decision @-@ making .
but by En@@ de@@ ff@@ ect , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority of the world has become .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blo@@ c note of the then Leit@@ z Ben S. Bern@@ anke , in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could expand their monetary expansion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; dissolved Tur@@ bul@@ ations around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world , increasing together in the markets and economies are increasingly popular , that they can not only monitor the developments in other place but also advis@@ ing other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for the Asset Management of Company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeffrey Sha@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA , noted this month that &quot; F@@ ed has linked a history of transactions on financial market movements that are associated with the economic Fund@@ ament@@ ally . &quot;
St@@ acker , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , set up for a interest rate , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to bring their head@@ lines by 0,@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited knowledge to reduce growth in the US &quot; said L@@ acker .
one year later , the F@@ ed representative re@@ vo@@ ke these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only be given the initial aspects of financial stability during a heavy crisis same as the 2008 market place said , Adam S. Pos@@ en , former member of the Committee on the interest re@@ financing of the Bank of England .
the latest tur@@ bul@@ ences do not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely I will not fall into the situation in which they fear a rate of interest because the markets collap@@ sed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pozn@@ an , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this has been changed , I do not think that it should be the time before@@ hand .

Brazilian pe@@ diat@@ ric society Rio Grande contributes to nutrition for healthy n@@ urs@@ ing
the Brazilian pe@@ diat@@ ric GT@@ RS is trying to clari@@ fy women on how important good diet during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted on br@@ oth , who are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , the babies give all nutrients you need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are expected to raise their daily cal@@ orie intake by around 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ et@@ etic adap@@ tion that should be mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet may actually affect the genes of her babies and protects them from tum@@ ours .
unfortunately a healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively influence the immune system .
excep@@ tions for the new Bern@@ ad@@ der sports hall
the municipal office Bern@@ i approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million Euro sports hall .
and he was an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter to solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn@@ table structure on the Bern@@ rie@@ der sports grounds come step by step forward : in the recent Community session , the elabor@@ ated building contract was blessed without large discussions .
prior to this , the panel filed an application for a legal &quot; exception &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we went permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is to be erected in arti@@ cul@@ ation with non @-@ cont@@ enti@@ ous first and roof top . &quot; &quot; &quot;
background of the planning is the planned use of the roof space for solar thermal systems : &quot; as a result , we get a wonderful big southern part , &quot; declared mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again , there went for the t@@ ilt for energy reasons - other than in the construction plan - below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is significantly reduced in the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan allowed to ad@@ per@@ ate no means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council generally restri@@ c@@ tive restri@@ c@@ ting drugs to the exemp@@ tion contracts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is no recur@@ ring project in the gym , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We may not make a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and of SV .
costs are estimated at CHF 2.3 million .
grants are expected from the training and breaking promotion of the school .
within the next process step , the building contract for the 18 x 36 meters will be presented to the Land@@ shut and with the testing .
hospital at P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moving to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is supposed to be closed than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of associates move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the Land@@ di@@ ac which confirmed the landing stages in Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white .
this is a decision about that , however , to meet the Supervisory Board and tomorrow that ended on Wednesday , 23 September .
should the plans be implemented , then all the nearly 50 employees will continue at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority of soldiers with fishermen and the further existing interior station to Sch@@ ong@@ au move .
the rooms are present .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the staff who do not go with Sch@@ ong@@ au shall be offered a job in W@@ eil@@ heim , as says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the staff are informed of the plans .
the change started the change of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer hospital since the beginning of the beginning of the year and is now to a private practice in close proximity of the hospital .
on the question who is to take over will succeed , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; into the game being willing to take over from October 1st , he will take the lead with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is in each case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreci@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a prop@@ ag@@ ation of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the inside of the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
transitional arrangements for the next two years is to lead Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board conven@@ es the right to access them , until then next year the former hospital of the chapel , which still has over 35 beds , is due to be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
so far , the administrative district was planned for 2018 , when the current restoration work was completed at the Hospital W@@ eil@@ heim .
landing in J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , rum@@ oured that the property , which is in possession of the federal government , will in future be used as an accommodation for asylum applications .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was I close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the property of the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white could not say , there are several thoughts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently , there are a short @-@ time care of Car@@ itas and an Tag@@ esp@@ sych@@ iat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what concerns us not happen , such an opportunity will not return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so fishermen on the Qu@@ asi , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the qu@@ asi , had been very positi@@ vely received by the workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very comprehen@@ sible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective of the house where fishermen has worked for over 30 years as che@@ at works have not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues , to take the post of the Medical Director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closure over the past decades , departments became closed , for example the surgery and birth .

refugees Need accommodations : study war@@ ns of housing
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
even more refugees seek a pay@@ ed lead .
the print on the housing market is growing .
the social housing is a challenge .
the distribution network in the German housing market have long since started .
with the coming refugees and employment search out of the EU , more people are on a market which has already over@@ loaded in many large cities .
they compete with multi @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
by 2020 , we have to cover the demand for affordable housing , which 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built by 2020 .
the result is a study on the order of the association of social housing . &quot;
by comparison , some 26@@ 0,000 units are finished this year .
there@@ from 14@@ 0,000 apartments are lack@@ ing homes .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees is no longer required to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a first time accommodation .
many cr@@ ushing onto the housing market and rows over long p@@ ents in front of the rental apartments .
according to the Federal Office of Statist@@ ical Office , less than half of the asylum seek@@ ers took place in the last year .
however , the negative development of the food market is not only for the rising of the refugees .
the study also makes significant emer@@ gen@@ cies in the housing policy of the last years .
Germany is an H@@ ousing Bureau in front of her , which is bigger than year to year .
currently in the bal@@ lo@@ area , Matthias Günther , compl@@ ains with Matthias Günther , the author of the study .
many professional positions have therefore lived in large cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained non @-@ voluntary longer in &quot; Hotel Mom@@ my &quot; at the home market in voluntary longer in &quot; Hotel Mom@@ my . &quot;
the number of square meters per capita in the major cities has fallen for the first time in the last years .
in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social Network &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
new an@@ te@@ ens intended to re@@ launch the social housing .
thus , the tax @-@ tax tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax rate will be suspended for subsidi@@ zed apartments .
attractive tax am@@ ort@@ isation shall also be necessary according to the alliance .
the funding program for refugee accommodations for Kf@@ W now comes well with cities and municipalities already well .
a good week after the start , at 184 million euros , more than half of the estimated 300 million euro have already been called .
now the project might be enlarged .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia is a hall@@ way
there is practically no way to Hungary anymore because there are always more refugees the way across Croatia .
Zagreb announces that , the trip through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ dles .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia via the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked with Sloven@@ ian Minister , and when it is necessary , we will organize a cor@@ ridor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister of Interior Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already one of the Sch@@ engen area .
the EU country Croatia is not a Sch@@ engen Area .
after the ranking of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to reach Western Europe .
500 people have arrived over the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television report reports .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees from the previous day .
new laws , which occurred on the same day in force , will make it practically unnecessary asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic had said , &quot; You can go through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
these people are there , women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
however , people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police launched the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the European Region of Croatia .
most of the media reports , according to Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both with the bus and tax@@ is to the Serbian border of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they had tried to go on foot across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serb border , the refugees meet not on the border .
the g@@ line strip other dangers involved , there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s .
min@@ e@@ fields will quickly create a safe passage quickly .
after the closure of the border , there is hardly any more refugees after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police was attended by 366 .
just before tor@@ sion on Monday there were 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws watch the over@@ coming and damage of the limit force to us as an off@@ ender .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convicted prisoners sentenced to five years and exp@@ ulsion from the country .
according to the immigration authorities , we have received a total of 94 asylum seek@@ ers on Tuesday , including almost all of them - 93 - most important passage in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicant , 13 families with small children as well as two older people are .
there were 40 refugees in the morning of Wednesday .
practically , no one has granted a view to be granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the asylum seek@@ ers should apply there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up workers in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they gathered the gar@@ bage that left the tens of thousands of people over the past weeks .
re@@ gr@@ illes were dismant@@ led and re@@ mod@@ eled at the border camp in the bound@@ ary .
to the aim of this reconstruction nobody wanted to express .
Austria reached a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
Moreover , the country has strengthened its border controls .
but about 20.000 migrants were still considered to government officials , but still in the country .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people wait for the ferry trip to Germany .
the train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning of the German authorities in the morning .
in Freil@@ assing , there are regularly smaller groups of refugees too on foot .
Mayor of &quot; Gest@@ ran@@ ces &quot; on the Border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we stayed after the bridge on Sunday with the re@@ premises , when suddenly ten people with trav@@ ellers gathered at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wer@@ n@@ stein Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to tour with the train to Passau .
because Germany had sur@@ prisingly demanded the railway traffic in Austria on Sunday , however , it had been sur@@ prisingly enough for her in Wer@@ n@@ stein , &quot; thus Stad@@ ler , who calls for immediate assistance with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border to the near Passau .
we &apos;ve stopped the un@@ trusted guests only once with lunch and drinks .
we &apos;ve said it , we bring them to Passau with the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N chat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grat@@ eful .
a man would not take it to transfer a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; this is very pleased , &quot; so that Stad@@ ler has pleased us .
the registered train men were on Sunday evening in Wels from a ICE in a regional train to Passau , to prove it after the brief notice that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped , but still beyond the border .
the regional train was dropped at the Inn factory at Wer@@ n@@ stein &apos;s border .
in Wer@@ n@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge collap@@ sed with Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , a b@@ illing run @-@ lasting - organized by Union Wer@@ n@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now send another forty of us to us , is a logical result of a apparent policy :
instead , rather in the siege of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke on the erection of structures in order to ensure human mobility , our Federal Chancellor hosted the official and public the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ Circle of National Soci@@ alism .
cor@@ d@@ ding of these policy are not only those Austrian that are con@@ fron@@ ted with cha@@ otic conditions now in the border areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to find that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcome , nothing but a further refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge in view of the continuing refugee flows and the shooting angle , with us de@@ cent condition for protective seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it will be an even bigger - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad onto the search of 35,000 w@@ inter@@ firm quin@@ quarters
Konrad has filled all hands with the refugee .
Christian Konrad is there in fact that his word has weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the former mighty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to create quot@@ a for the thousand refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad has already won the chaos in the first time centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accommodation of 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ ing performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of the Interior spoke by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ris@@ ky situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad and a demand of 85@@ ,000 Qu@@ arti@@ facts will be added .
in order to meet the number , 35,000 units must be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 of them will provide 15.000 to the federal states .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the state capit@@ als , he has already conducted interviews .
they had promised him , even for the coming refugees Qu@@ arti@@ ere , too .
&quot; in Upper Austria it goes well , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow a meeting with Cardinal Christophe Schön@@ born , will be clari@@ fied , as the church will help .
great expectations per@@ taining to the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator also in the ORF Action campaign &quot; Hel@@ ping like We . &quot;
on the platform private individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodations .
in addition , restaurant hopes to be vac@@ ated in winter .
in late 2013 , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ises the standard for &quot; highly high . &quot;
in emergency times it cannot be that qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors have to stick a certain height of the hand@@ held holder , or the size of the surface .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to the Ministry of Interior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has justified herself with his experience in the way of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accommodation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am an older Lord that you will not say without further into the face of the truth .

Linz demands a better break@@ down
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no opening of urban sports and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and design Centre for the housing of refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is currently no longer necessary , as people can currently under@@ go by without these measures , Mayor Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) says .
for emergency , however , further locations are to be checked for their di@@ ver .
critic@@ ising the authorities for the division of refugees inside the federal state .
other districts have to aff@@ ord to make their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not cancelled &quot;
in a longer telephone with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ehr@@ inger ( VP ) reported further advantages over refugees in refugees .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er gave me assured that German borders are not sealed .
the further extension of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany remain possible .
however , it is possible to control the corresponding border controls .
special privileg@@ es with refugees to Germany there will be no more available .
however , the sigh@@ ting would be brought with regular trains to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; member of the other EU member states called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stir@@ r@@ ents once again stronger solidarity in the refugees query . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that Austria entered its borders again with its borders , is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the approach of the German . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the nearest R@@ unt@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new ship@@ yard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Ship@@ yard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is included , the rest ( 2700 square metres ) should be rented in young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the wise heads are our raw material - and we must attempt to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T b@@ oss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine to invest in the start@@ up companies of the New Ship@@ yard and which will also be liquid@@ ated later .
from the out@@ set , S &amp; T wants to co@@ operate with the new neigh@@ bors - which is surprising : &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a question of time . &quot;
EUR 1.7 million were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ centre , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , Upper Austria and the federal ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is on lease from the Linz Europe for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as technical center .
30 percent of the 2700 square meters of residual space in the building are already rented , for a further 40 percent give it requests .
L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ is opened second business in the ar@@ cade
in the new shop , Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are at the centre .
actually Jutta Bre@@ it wanted to settle a dog .
the project had to push her project &apos;s 49 @-@ year @-@ old colleague of L@@ ia Per@@ oni into the Tau@@ ro @-@ Ark@@ ade : finally , it is now expanding its growth in the form of another business local .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop , compared to the business , in which it sells for bags , bags , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , everything is turning to have women &apos;s hand@@ bags , wall@@ ets from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories costs up to 500 Euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
before , a lot of weeks was rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have covered a long time , if I would like to open a load , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bre@@ it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was that , among other things , the Fur@@ la producers , which are home in Bologna , was driven at home from the idea of a own site , where only her hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only ones in the big room of Linz , who sell this stamp , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has made up the Italian roots .
her fashion interests has been created Bre@@ it of her mother in the cra@@ dle .
most of me , if something is developing and I can show new Trends in affordable prices .
and as some woman in a look at a beautiful hand@@ bag in the equ@@ ipping unit , the specialist woman cannot answer with last security .
maybe it &apos;s about it real@@ izes a beautiful bag of any out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer family of Donald Tr@@ ump came from one place , whose inhabitants are called an@@ onym .
this property connects man@@ cher with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for comm@@ uter .
if he ex@@ presses foreign host@@ ility , repor@@ ters or knowledge g@@ aps in the international crisis policy - candidates for the US presidential decision is strongly stim@@ ulated for election campaign .
and cuts fine well .
this is also registered in the Palat@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents come from the real estate million .
the New Yorker with the cor@@ ridor is a large term in the win@@ emaker village on the wine road .
man@@ ners in the 1200 inhabitants site is related to over -@@ Fort@@ y corners with him .
his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the driver of Simone Wendel was making a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal , the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that som@@ eh@@ ow are exciting , but they were not so pro@@ found@@ ly impressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wendel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native of K@@ all@@ y@@ judge has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its fam@@ ation spro@@ uts , to which Tr@@ ump has also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to Word - according to the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in k@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to the king of hearts .
indeed there is respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ ds the opinion that Tr@@ ump has already a little &apos; la@@ zy , &quot; says Wendel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; random song lu@@ te the nickn@@ ame , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ en@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a circum@@ ference , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ en@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is said to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Ac@@ ci@@ dent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tr@@ ump is therefore from the village of the an@@ onym .
the inf@@ ump of success story began in 1885 when the last grand@@ father immig@@ rated and opened a place for gold graves in the USA .
corn@@ erst@@ one of the real estate market were first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : her wish to return to the home in time failed by the Bavarian State , in which the Palat@@ inate was at that time .
he did not accept Tr@@ ump , because he was previously un@@ approved without hom@@ ologation , the director of the institute for p@@ fäl@@ ische history and eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , was declared film start .
Tr@@ ump was the grand@@ son of an illeg@@ itim@@ ate emig@@ ration . &quot;
this means in contrast to the im@@ pet@@ us statements of the desc@@ endants .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the US and required the construction of a border to overcome illegal immigrants .
&quot; as is the Polish , that &apos;s not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , an aw@@ k@@ ous tr@@ umps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a new@@ born Tr@@ ump , born Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the retirement of the win@@ em@@ akers have more dist@@ illed to the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s always one thousand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do he believe that Tr@@ ump takes time ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he has never been bent around K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension fund organized by Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm , like some K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter , menti@@ ons that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz &apos; family stopped for a visit to the church organ , which was generally well ass@@ orted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine the Donald &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they ple@@ t better when he don &apos;t want the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the has such radi@@ al views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had prepared for his grand@@ father in the United States have had , as he would have been there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are sexually mature without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
W@@ end@@ els film , which has been inter@@ viewed for the Tr@@ ump , have seen 12 000 child guides , including in the USA , aw@@ akes the interest .

secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki might have apparently un@@ wanted , who wins the bach@@ elor &apos;s degree .
the woman , at the bottom of the Sam Wood , landed at The Bachelor , has been ro@@ oted in biggest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining boys will certainly not be priced , if it is the one who received the last Rose .
but when we met Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before the three are on , you probably have given a hint on it who will be the winner .
Sam Wood does sealed his lips until the final on Thursday
all three women have left their ly@@ rical mode , why Wood is the perfect man , and that called his mind for hum@@ our , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as a reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? , &quot; could her answers to the destro@@ yer , who won the heart of the brook .
both Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki are both fast - except for themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay is the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood from the first day have an easy relationship .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ah ) and SAM@@ S Energi@@ es meant , I felt that she was quite compatible , and I did it in the entire course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah sits with both feet on the earth , making it a lot of fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pap@@ os@@ ki added &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ve seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood as a couple well suited .
from the point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made it clear that Wood &quot; could be one &quot; one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it was clear that it is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m already being set up on him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked to choose Wood , they were not , that she was smoo@@ ther .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girl alike - it is an accident between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on top ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ r@@ yd Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle demonstrated strong interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams that send message after its impressive meeting day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ as@@ ula and it looks like a clu@@ sion decision .
some Trainer would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game when he lost a rum@@ ble as it did the Aus@@ sie Rug@@ by League conqu@@ ering in his first pac@@ ed Return on Tuesday after 20 @-@ 3 win against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula confi@@ ded to his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to have a colored return and also into the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ as@@ ula continues to be his true face in the dressing cabin after the game .
instead of paying his ro@@ ok@@ ies ahead of the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged her .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne also publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Techni@@ que Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was encouraged by the special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ G@@ aug@@ he@@ y , who ri@@ et him to take his f@@ atten@@ ed catch and take care of the next game .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a thing which is mentioned now , one takes care of the next game , and it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne decided the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut at that time in 2007 , when a pass conducted in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .

on mon@@ th@@ ang , closed doors has been negoti@@ ated , executed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday area near the Small Sea is near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stakeholders , the medium @-@ sized company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System Building &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening .
originally this point was originally con@@ founded on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP group , including the investors and administration of intelligence , Ralf Beh@@ ren@@ ds went away from the system construction company into the offensive : &quot; we don &apos;t have a reply to all questions , &quot; he said before the members of the Council and more than 50 visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it was good to face all the rum@@ ors now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project involves around ten to twelve million Euros , has been in discussion since months .
sharp reactions from sea @-@ bu@@ sters , who came to the meeting , called the pictures and new details for the desired hotel construction .
Roberto Martin , Meer@@ bu@@ den@@ shar@@ pen@@ er , and member of the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ gle , Pro H@@ ieve , procla@@ im : &quot; this will be a giant , which stands out all the others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , as some other project critic , he feared the intended size of the plant strongly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the bus@@ ses come to see , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz , &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what happens on the good one hectare estate of the former restaurant , it is still open .
still there is no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a model described concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Beh@@ ren@@ ds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack , the construction plans are still variable .

Google launches dou@@ bling @-@ donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc . ( Goo@@ dings ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ to @-@ don@@ ate campaign , that the thousands of refugees begin to help refugees from refugees that over@@ threw the nations , as they flee from war torn and poor countries .
Google has an un@@ common personal approach in the announcement of the donations in his blog .
instead of a manager make the announcement , Rita Mass@@ oud wrote a Google employee who had fled with her family from Kabul , when she was seven years old , on their personal experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our journey , many dark rail@@ ways and bus@@ y@@ ings were also like hunger , thirst , cold and angu@@ ish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but as refugees cap@@ turing a refugee crisis in Europe , many people are looking for assistance to help my family .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations to help refugees and migrants : physi@@ cians without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Control , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google told that the first global donations will be doubled up to a value of 5,5 million in goo@@ gle@@ .com / $ 11 million .
it is con@@ fron@@ ted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , mainly caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year .
many people were also wander@@ ing from the war , Yemen , Iraq , and Libya , too .

for easily overweight di@@ abet@@ ics , weight loss keys can be helpful .
the advantages of weight loss techniques for mild to overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether ultra @-@ overweight people with diabetes , after weight loss , live longer than those who are non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data require a long time to show something &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss sur@@ geon , who wrote an expert article on the new study in j@@ ama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss of loss or preventing childhood surgery , use different methods to shr@@ ink the size of stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to include food .
in addition , obes@@ ity operations became effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies were performed in humans that are cran@@ k@@ ful with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight relative to size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BMI of 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI code : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans C @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data gathered in a study and compare two kinds of obes@@ ity - Mag@@ enb@@ yp@@ ass and stomach cancer - related to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BMI of those who under@@ go this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI with one who non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments was approximately equal to 29 .
one of those who under@@ gone surgery in surgical procedure was completely dissolved in 36 % of the diabetes disease and at 28 % .
in the medical group of patients , diabetes itself tot@@ alled only one percent , and partly only approximately two percent .
in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and of the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ in@@ - were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; found the authors .
the researchers also monitored the patient @-@ blood mirror of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood glucose levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c levels decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as demonstrated in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reflect the mortality in five years , such as the researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team assi@@ sts average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the B@@ yp@@ ass @-@ Surgery Group had lost more weight compared to the gast@@ re@@ tom@@ y group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reached larger dec@@ lines ( 7.4 vs. 5.1 % ) and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and had a complete over@@ coming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study showed no survival benefit for surgery after five years , there are evidence of a survey of serious people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer lifetime , says Black@@ stone von der University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was subjected to ob@@ ese people who were subjected to obes@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die during 15 years - compared to a group receiving conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery @-@ patients , Black@@ stone , it &apos;s s@@ oo@@ thing for persons with a BMI of 35 persons who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it is said that this operation is lower on the lower BMI group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without elevated risk of death or kidney disease &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their physi@@ cians should begin to reap the weight as soon as the patient with its BMI between 27 and 30 is expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait for a long time , till we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once these genetic changes have accumulated , that have attached her body with obes@@ ity and diabetes , is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot;
love story is in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
it is a theme that is currently immersed in Bell@@ et@@ rist@@ ik : a young woman , too popular and in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous , meets after years after the weak of her youth , and he loves them in love .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Even so we are not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; von Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel might be interesting for H@@ uns@@ r@@ ents readers , because he plays in Lang@@ we@@ iler and the surrounding settlements .
the general professional author was raised in Lang@@ we@@ iler and is looking forward to a literary monument in her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
in Europe , all refugees could not record any number of refugees , the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders promp@@ ted violence to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his 10th day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which Eth@@ ics studies devoted to eth@@ ics studies .
he demanded that , under the circumstances , he demanded the interests of humanity especially to the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of West European countries on the refugee crisis are wonderful , but the situation was not adequ@@ ately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama proposed Germany and Austria to tackle the crisis , he emphas@@ ized that there was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly by education , for those Muslim countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , we must re@@ consider how the killing is reduced in its countries .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence has never been solved , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also said the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action on September 11 , pointing out that the non @-@ violent reaction in the USA drew a chain of un@@ control@@ l@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my g@@ ulation in a letter to President Bush and I said it , the way to resol@@ ve this problem is in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , his moti@@ ves were good , but he replaced violence , and it had unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase of consumption of hand@@ des@@ men agents by children in the last 4 years
po@@ ison control centres in the US reports about an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in children under 12 years of age who swal@@ low a huge decline in disinfection , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord L@@ op@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , reported cases of revenue from hand @-@ infection in children under 12 years , to report po@@ ison control centres , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly more common in these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them go in the emergency photo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ op@@ ez CNN . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children of disinfect@@ ant should be inten@@ tionally drinking , while some of them can do to im@@ press their friends or cause a mut@@ ation for the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinfect@@ ant should only drink for a budget experience .
te@@ ens have allegedly shu@@ ff@@ led disinfect@@ ant with non@@ alcoholic mouth water to obtain a har@@ sh drink .
younger children can be created by attractive sets of disinfect@@ ants .
&quot; one child doesn &apos;t think that it is bad for it , &quot; said L@@ op@@ ez .
many of the attractive ( hand @-@ disinfect@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ ud@@ ed .
there are disinfect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange fragran@@ ce that are very appe@@ aling to children .
suspension infections included somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly with infants , few shots can lead to alcohol in@@ tox@@ ication .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ listed Centre at the University of Kansas , The Fox 4 , Kan@@ sa City .
so you would not be whis@@ key whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand @-@ disinfect@@ ant in reach of children , and if children are coming , then it is a quick possibility to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently taken four sy@@ ringe from the straw@@ berry des@@ infection medium in school , was taken into a not@@ ion for the treatment .
her blood alcohol concentrations was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is considered to be drunk with an adult , said Dr. Chris R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey , a not@@ ion doctor who was running at G@@ win@@ nice Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah caught her words and was not able to go to the situation as they arrived in the emergency reception .
doctors tend them over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , since the girl was dropped by the alcohol , said R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; this was very troubled , &quot; said Or@@ ja Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ther@@ s Mutter , CNN .
it would have been fatal for my child .
L@@ op@@ ez has parents and teachers , non @-@ alcoholic and disinfection products or disinfection products outside the child &apos;s operating range .
some alcohol in@@ tox@@ ication were also associated with f@@ atal@@ ities .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario , after the st@@ ating of ham@@ let infection , which ab@@ stain@@ ed a toxic , non @-@ evident ingre@@ dient .
the health authorities rate the product me@@ thanol which contained the product me@@ thanol , a deadly solution instead of ethylene alcohol , which was recorded as an ingre@@ dient .
in January planned three students of the fourth class in the state of New York , their &quot; master@@ y &quot; teacher , po@@ is@@ oning with anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; so it reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic against ham@@ let infection , and devoted them from their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police concerned the failed blu@@ epr@@ int as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bul@@ l@@ ät@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and proved the disciplinary action to the school . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the lack of title competition in Scottish football - bo@@ red Dutch - de Bo@@ er
former ran@@ der &apos;s mid@@ fiel@@ der and past National gam@@ er in the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , as there are no title rival with the Rang@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently a ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland do they have no highlights of the Cel@@ tic games more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people are not just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they speak together of both teams and that &apos;s interested in it .
there are a lot of voltage inside the old Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people of Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn around , swe@@ ars D@@ eil@@ a .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eil@@ a accepted that Cel@@ tic doesn &apos;t have to fight , but the nor@@ we@@ gian radi@@ ators turn to turn the things .
following the defeat against Malmö and the following departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aberdeen , which now ends with five points advance clearly on the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ eil@@ a said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic already had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that exactly so - but we must go on .
we really need really , really the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes the players better .
now together , it is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while they rise in the United Kingdom in total .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in the period of May until July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without working for the United Kingdom had risen from 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate was 5.9 percent above the level of U@@ K@@ s from 5.5 per cent , as the numbers of National Statistics for National Statistics ( ONS ) exhibited .
in the meantime , the employment in Scotland fell to 12,000 throughout the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell in the course of the quarter to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the annual UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the state Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the recent figures and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is almost a year ago that Scotland has hit the historical decision to remain part of the United Kingdom . &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I will be a witness to O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later , except in late legal intervention , I will see how a man will be put to death .
when it happens , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by le@@ thal injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was for the first time in January over his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , so I voted .
when the day was closer , I began to fear me .
so , why should I do it ?
I voted because I thought it would be a good opportunity to talk about the death penalty .
it would be a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists may see exec@@ utions in the USA , and since often more applicants are available as places where there is a perfect lot@@ tery to decide who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
anyone is selected , that will keep it bi@@ ke@@ en .
I cannot do that .
in addition to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p &apos;s close friend , I will head my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two @-@ and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh too much if we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness , and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook &amp; pen to draw what I see .
I have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of dancing my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of a prisoner , as he wants it , and you will get access .
I cont@@ end me with you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she dre@@ amed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulating &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it still th@@ inks that it is wrong , what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I have said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants us to present an international rep@@ orter to be there .
when he dies , he th@@ inks that public relations work against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter by the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be sitting beside me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of Pod@@ casts which I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details .
I cannot say with security that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions under the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him a ple@@ a , a privileg@@ ed effect .
but I believe that there is a strong od@@ ds that he is not guilty of mor@@ ality .
I &apos;m sure that there is not enough evidence to just@@ ify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can &apos;t asser@@ t that really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters that you can apply for it .
what you can get of me is what it means to see a man to die unnecessary death .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that stew@@ ards tried to pi@@ sted and threat@@ ening it to end racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that the stew@@ ards of racing Victoria have attempted to install a sp@@ y in its st@@ ables last year and threatened to stop the race immediately .
he imp@@ acted on the stew@@ ards and the integration of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last stro@@ kes on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he is always trying to do what is best for racing , and he himself found himself under difficult conditions as it went about the positive co@@ b@@ alt group of Li@@ dar@@ is that he could not explain .
he had kept back 18 months because of the sp@@ ying days and didn &apos;t want to look something like too high . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say nothing to say , and I have given many things to eat , but sometimes you are fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react , and we must live with the consequences , and I must live with it what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I would like to go about the head , and I want to think my owners I tried my best .
if they begin to think , I do not do it , then I should not be any more trainer .
I then have to think about what I do with my license .
earlier , Moo@@ dy had advanced the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com for real@@ izing that the integrity Department had tried to print his stable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the eigh@@ teenth year , Ter@@ ry b@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I &apos;m involved - and told him a job in my st@@ ables , to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that I am an actu@@ ator .
if the case is , they must surely be able to gr@@ asp their ne@@ ases , because they try to hold me in mind .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ w , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were deliber@@ ately aware of the period and today it is still today .
should that be aware of the view that it is personally responsible ?
has the R@@ V@@ L wh@@ ist@@ le and makes people responsible outside of train@@ ers responsible for what is happening in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people think outside , that I am it .
perhaps they must take my license and drove me off , and I have no doubt that what I say , that can now think about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will execute the pressure on them and rush to make a decision .
I have support of my family and I can go .
the l@@ ungs @-@ levels of train@@ ers are built with the long lasting co@@ b@@ alt analysis near Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching carried out that he could t@@ oss his license above the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for its preparation of the un@@ ador@@ ned master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , called the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous &quot; after a package of mud or sound on the horse run@@ e had been applied , resulting against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to assume full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees don &apos;t use lu@@ dge for the lamb . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been so yesterday the whole day so that was so .
it was also so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be con@@ test@@ ated with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package at the race day . an inquiry into this aff@@ air has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who constitute the rules , don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules but here one went too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy proposes against tor@@ ial claims against ri@@ vals .
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised cr@@ iti@@ que of his player as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favorites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rer has allowed the Storm @-@ Up &quot; ring contest &quot; with his team during the high @-@ performance champion in Sydney in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ co Trainer Wayne Bennett was a hard case conce@@ aled the Storm team , after his team had reached the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of Rug@@ by League , saying that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land was not &quot; good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the h@@ ack@@ y of his team and said that she will be concentr@@ ating on her &quot; Contact &quot; at the T@@ ack@@ ling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers in his team were confident , since it f@@ ails to make it wor@@ ried away from the Storm @-@ Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s always up again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson was talking about ring competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that in all year we have changed nothing at our def@@ ensive system or the techniques . however , during the last six weeks we have made our contact with T@@ ack@@ les at a real focal point , and that produced for us the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent is now there for three years , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not getting used to lose it , then it was a little shock for him .
it is funny , just as it is possible to dive up again at this season .
Bell@@ amy has attacked her kind of football , attacked and commemor@@ ating his ment@@ or that Ben@@ net@@ ts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra D@@ RA@@ G@@ ONS won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; slow playing &quot; soccer .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he dropped his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting your game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critical when a bor@@ ing team was critical , and Wayne said that he will take care of a partition of divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and play as exciting , especially its young players with their speed .
this is the ball@@ ad playing , which one like to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as they play these .
I build a stronger faith because they say these things , because they have a little wor@@ ried about to play against us .
six weeks ago they did not think about us when it went around the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy pointed out that the Storm Scout against Roo@@ ster makes a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ cos was well a good game I haven &apos;t seen it , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game but is it an exciting game ?
or are breaks and have no points out of tension ?
for me it is the schem@@ atics .
if they mention us , it means we will be able to meet again in one phase .
the Storm team ended on this weekend as they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening in the pre@@ finale in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin from next morning hours .
lifetime subject to a drug with 200,000 $
a man , possibly a life sentence is threat@@ ening to come in the possession of about 40 kilograms co@@ ca@@ ine , which have been l@@ ashed down to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police arrested 100 kg of thr@@ ott@@ le on the yacht charter , which came from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the course of the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly life sentence for the try , a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , argu@@ ed that it was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that at the café in a harm@@ less reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the risk of flood at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; declared the Court on Wednesday .
when the case had been causing the police , he was lying on his residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and st@@ ep@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security jointly to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the reading of the early explanations of the two persons , it is clear that the edition of a safety of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; judge Flan@@ agan too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this alone won &apos;t be enough to hold him out of it , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on security , under the conditions that he announces his austr@@ alian and his Serbian passport , if the police reports a daily and itself at an output block of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

all two years at the IAA shows the motor car at the IAA their novel@@ ties show their novel@@ ties .
above all movement for the compact cars , which currently is particularly well prepared for the compact cars .
cars from the compact class are currently being asked : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registrations were accounted for by the German Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August at this segment .
this is reflected at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence stage 17th to 27th of September ) .
this year , many new compact models are presented between all of the fut@@ ur@@ istic conc@@ ep@@ tic vehicles and new cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German automobile industry is the Opel Astra , which will be tra@@ cked in the deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann on the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he belongs to the core of the stamp .
the new Astra also does not have much more expensive than the fact that the new Astra is also not much more expensive .
Opel will start a entry below the biggest compet@@ itor VW Golf in view , which k@@ icks off at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost from 16 990 Euros .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time .
unlike the most important compet@@ itor of the VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra will initially only be five @-@ fifth .
a second version will follow in the spring of the station , which is already shown at the IAA in 2006 .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA or new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra compet@@ itor to the race .
the Mé@@ gan@@ e is a fifth part in a conventional and an emphas@@ ized sports GT version at the fair .
at the beginning of next year , it is then a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ off@@ shoot will be able to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fit in the design line of the brand .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
however , the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno segment , which is its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 Newton metres ( Nm ) according to the manufacturer .

inside the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system has been moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and its first Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play .
a series of super@@ visions and new versions are added to the IAA in the compact class , as the rear @-@ loaded Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres cell is human un@@ worthy
the Court took part in an ex @-@ prisoner of the Federal Chancellor of Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell on months .
due to the violation of their human rights , in@@ mates were eligible for financial compensation if they are in small cells .
the Federal Constitutional Court decided in an decision adopted on Wednesday in Wednesday .
those affected can therefore hope for money , if they were only imprisoned for a few days in the spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus a former in@@ mate was successfully held in Karlsruhe with its Constitutional Compl@@ aint founded in Karlsruhe . he was housed in a single cell composed of around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was dre@@ am@@ assed .
after that , the man who had gone up again on foot of his wal@@ lows , has now been moved to a bigger cell .
his legal notice of liability toward the State of Berlin would fail .
but the Constitutional judges took up the decision of the Berlin Chamber of Appeal and exp@@ elled the case to the renewed examination .
you will see the man &apos;s human beings .
Chamber Jud@@ ges now decides about the amount of compensation
even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of Dis@@ counts may be responsible for the compensation , a compensation burden was given .
otherwise , &quot; a short@@ age of the legal protection of personality is to be fear . &quot;
the Chamber Code must now clari@@ fy the amount of money .
the constitutional court often have already strengthened the rights of pris@@ ion@@ ers in the past .
so they did not say in April of an in@@ mate , because he was imprisoned in a cell .
human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 also the majority occupancy of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , in November 2009 , the Berlin Constitutional Court has also confirmed a de@@ cent accommodation in a parallel accident in the parallel port of a prisoner in November 2009 .
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs was over three months away from 15 to 21 hours in a homogen@@ ous cell like in Karls@@ bad case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons have come into the head@@ lines in the last weeks due to lack of staff .
prisoners are therefore kept back 23 hours including the aggres@@ si@@ vity , even to slaughter animals , it is due to have already been mentioned because of the sp@@ clu@@ ded situation .
21 positions are not covered in Te@@ gel for young reasons , 19 must fall by 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we &apos;re creating the &quot;
the Im@@ migration of Refu@@ ge@@ es is a tremend@@ ous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
according to the forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Finance this year , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to the German Chancellor , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , in Germany to support one million refugees .
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do it , and we can do it . &quot;
what comes to Germany , gives the following overview .
it is needed according to various forecasts between 3@@ 50000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Research ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ el Institute ) apartments each year - throughout the next five years .
that is almost twice as much as it is built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
dramatic is the lack of living space but above all the rental properties : each year 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments from the rent of the rent out , and around these specially affordable apartments will apply to refugees .
Federal Minister for Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) will therefore have to double the funding from 518 million at one billion euros .
much too little is that from the view of the pest@@ le Institute : 80 000 Social dwellings are needed annually and would have to invest a funding in the amount of 6.4 billion per year .
in addition , scientists and Federal Building Minister are the fact that there are also more tax advantages for investment in residential buildings .
according to estimates by the institute for labor market and professional research , 55 per cent of the people in Germany can be employed in Germany in the long term .
however , in Germany , the refugees in Germany would not cure systematically with their qualification to help them with the start of help Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
however , for the integration of refugees , it is crucial to see whether they work in Germany .
the work is the key for social contacts , for the assessment in the capture company but also for self @-@ est@@ e@@ em of immigrants , says Mig@@ ration@@ al@@ ert Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , a political turn@@ around has been given , by the ban against refugees for the recognition of work .
while it has been an employment prohibition against asylum seek@@ ers by up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residential buildings sought to apply for asylum seek@@ ers .
in the company , the company has also made its visibility into account - assi@@ sting the visibility under way of view , enabling refugees to be transported faster than access to the labour market .
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are lack of German .
until now , there is no adequate supply of public and on @-@ related language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most commonly used by personal contacts .
therefore , the assembly of networks is thus setting to the thr@@ ott@@ le of the royal integration .
the Berlin School Management has found that only few dangerous parents give her children to the Kit@@ az , estimated at least 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ ro@@ oted parents , it is not important that the family says , &quot; says Il@@ ya Co . , spokesperson for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration .
to persu@@ ade the family , however , to convince the provision of the K@@ ita , distri@@ butes food short@@ list in different languages .
if the need of educ@@ ators strongly rise by the great number of refugees , the Senate would try to increase the training capacity - roughly , by more professional schools .
in the countries , students will be prepared with German skills in welcome classes .
however , they are not always taught by full educated teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have a qualification in German as the second language .
there is no lack of cases , says Be@@ ate St@@ akes of the Berlin School of Schul@@ te .
the German Student Union estimates that about 20 per cent of the refugees in Germany want to study in Germany .
basically , there is no land request for an asylum seek@@ ers or pla@@ que - the only exception was Berlin , the person director Frank handle ( CD@@ U ) , however , abandoned its position now .
study conditions for refugees may be facilit@@ ated the access to the university .
as refugees with a cre@@ mation or Dul@@ ce do not get any services according to the law of asylum , if they begin studying .
the latter come in principle not a B@@ af@@ o@@ g , as they are not falling under the number of those entitled persons .
Ged@@ ul@@ fed refugees had to have lived in Germany four years ago to become B@@ af@@ o@@ g @-@ entitled , dated 1 January 2016 , this will be shortened to 15 months .
but this funding gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Student Union .
the students should get B@@ af@@ o@@ g immediately .
Islam will in future play a more important role , as many refugees are Muslims , and many of them is the religion important component of their identity .
the state should have succ@@ essi@@ vely the same rights to Islam , as they have the churches , and to continue the existing state churches creation to a new state @-@ religi@@ ons ratio .
it would also be the founding of a Islamic Re@@ pro@@ pul@@ sion that car@@ es professional around the new@@ com@@ ers .
these rights are also duties .
so , the representatives of Islam have to agree to clear contact persons and to be willing to co@@ operate with the state in many areas and to give it certain control options .
to this end also the read@@ iness to inf@@ use their hearts to religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be registered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to con@@ stra@@ t those conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law of Arabic .
in future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
this means that the majority society may also change , its break@@ down of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be ur@@ ged .
Germany indeed has - as a result of European decisions - since a close decade an anti @-@ discrimination law and a general law of equality .
but it seems very slow just like the NSU @-@ Series , in which the police and authorities ig@@ no@@ red the c@@ aste motif systematically .
same chances for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and the stakeholders &apos; ni@@ ch@@ ures have to request long , and for what international tre@@ aties , such as the anti @-@ law en@@ forcement , have to become reality in the next few years , if the country shall remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany could not be able to nour@@ ish the already expected refugees , serious president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery writes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding Man@@ - Power and Capacities , we raise this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the daily view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , we must flow extra cash into the system .
to avoid narrow pas@@ sports , Mont@@ gom@@ ery calls for all charges at registration Health sk@@ et@@ ables .
performances could be reported later with the German federal states .
and long @-@ term , it was highly un@@ question@@ able , so many people with the limited performance of the item to see the law of asylum .
otherwise , doctors make the doctors especially to create the language barri@@ ers .
already so far , the Berlin medical scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de demonstrated that migrants will have been worse than other patients in en@@ patients than their in@@ firm@@ ities .
not only in clinics , also in medical practices must perform professional interpre@@ ting costs .
also helped many refugees too already with more gener@@ ational health prevention activities in emergency out@@ patient .

there are more in@@ treated disabilities in the refugee camps approximately with HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment with young people .

&quot; paras@@ it@@ end@@ or or tuber@@ culosis are not so difficult to recognize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as from the physi@@ cist angel , the refugees perhaps even alle@@ vi@@ ate a shift in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians had a highly developed educational system , and some of the refugees are even physi@@ cians .
however , in order to be pract@@ ised , however , they would have to re@@ ject their qualification and possibly with@@ in@@ duce aud@@ its .
at least half of the refugees in Germany is psych@@ ic ill after estimates by the Federal Psycho@@ therap@@ ist ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) , most of them suffer from post @-@ traum@@ atic load disorder or under depression .
especially viol@@ ate the refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent study by the TU München in Munich reveals that each fifth Syrian refugee camps were traum@@ ati@@ zed in Germany .
those who mal@@ ign@@ ant to a post@@ traum@@ atic load is suffering from amongst others in so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with bre@@ ads , di@@ zz@@ iness , cardi@@ ac and death .
further symptoms include sleep and concentration , strong scre@@ am and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent that the symptoms were chronic , it was necessary for early treatment , explained in Mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of psych@@ ic illness received a psycho@@ therapy only .
indeed , psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can put an application for psycho@@ therapy , however the processing usually takes several months .
furthermore , in the social workers , mostly functional workers or doctors who have not trained for psych@@ ic diseases , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mal@@ od@@ ations , says Mun@@ z .

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mug@@ abe holds a false speech in parliament
M@@ R Mug@@ abe , Africa &apos;s oldest leaders , falling down the steps at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the drop of the Falls spread quickly beyond the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s inauguration was also tried by alleg@@ ations of representatives of the opposition that they had reported anonymous thre@@ ats and warned them to super@@ v@@ ise the address by Mr Mug@@ abe .
last month they had hat@@ ched him , and during his talk to the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech that he repeated in Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Opp@@ os@@ itions politicians have received SMS messages on their phone which claimed to distur@@ b Mr. Mug@@ abe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news comes from a number which is not displayed , but she spoke to the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said journalists in Mug@@ abe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it warned the members of the EU members that the immun@@ ity in Parliament ends , and once they leave the parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective .
the spokes@@ man said , &quot; the party was concerned by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers of the politicians .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard opens up to 30.000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will be expected to create 25.000 @-@ 30.000 jobs in restructuring and savings efforts throughout the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and split the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing enterprise hardware and service operations .
the expected control scale will lead to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in a declaration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP President and Chief Executive Officer , shall lead the unit after the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise is smaller and stronger than it today is , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of shops , supporting companies while transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better nominated than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion US annual revenue and is to be concentrated on delivery of previously unknown , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; says a company &apos;s explanation .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930 &apos;s by graduates of the Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard , in order to produce electric plants and the Palo Alto Garage you have called &quot; the birth place of Sil@@ icon Valley . &quot;
hp has a solid restructuring process to tackle the removal of traditional PCs to mobile devices .

FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mates have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb after the past Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
W@@ enger pointed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it is only September , and if his rehabilitation runs under plan , there is no reason why he couldn &apos;t play before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England and will certainly not forget its participation in the next summer at the European Championship .
the great dis@@ grace with this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate an@@ kl@@ ing inj@@ ure , and then returned to its old swing during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not load the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that was not well healed .
this is no greater matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in combination with its an@@ kl@@ es or his injuries , which he had previously .
this may be true in his medical view , but as W@@ enger also accepted , there is the respective risk of other injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of season .
it also develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
Prime Minister In@@ jur@@ ies Ltd has recorded 23 different disorders of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
it was also played in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ as 157 Lig@@ ur@@ ists in the last five playing times .
the wider picture of Arsenal is that in six of eight game times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League Clubs were able to record most of the po@@ ets .
W@@ enger accepts the potential of a devil , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the injury of the injury during the last season will last .
&quot; sometimes , if you come from one breach , you &apos;ll have a gra@@ dient period of time , in which you need to strengthen your body and win bul@@ war@@ fare , &quot; said W@@ enger .
Jack is a young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabil@@ ized , I am confident that he will do it and he will get a career of this way he deser@@ ves .
Arsenal begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the play against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ lane on Wednesday , and W@@ enger made a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not go to Croatia , what means Math@@ ieu Deb@@ uch@@ y and Art@@ eta will begin .
W@@ enger also may start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of post@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to hold the balance and the players who need it , a small breathing @-@ pause , &quot; said W@@ enger .
although ar@@ senal are clear favorite , through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir @-@ Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most in@@ ti@@ mid@@ able currency effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; un@@ defeated &quot; campaign in the last season was launched .
the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , where the Richter scale was 3,2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
W@@ enger , however , is that ar@@ senal explo@@ red the apprentices@@ hip in the last season with the Champions League @-@ capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and stays from the far hope to lead the association to his first European premiere of Europe .
&quot; this drive is imm@@ en@@ sely , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it never worked with Arsenal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m a long enough in the shop to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are no dre@@ amer .
friendship festival : the com@@ edy show that gives us serious lessons on male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , particularly in terms of how the need for men to open oneself , now even des@@ per@@ ate than ever before , as sel@@ ective rate among young men prove to a 15 @-@ year high priest .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death amongst men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and there were three times more frequently in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign against the Mis@@ er@@ aser ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a erb@@ os@@ itive live ) 2015 as the year of man , with the aim to question the culture in question if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to tackle this challenge .
a recent study at more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ pressed symptoms showed that if the body had a suff@@ ici@@ ently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy m@@ oods , &quot; its chances of gender doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends sc@@ aled the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have only friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of guided communication , with its main focus on substance , the in@@ fertil@@ ity of response is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life have the need to show strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation is dominated .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists estimate exc@@ essive values , money , image , social status , all on costs of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner lon@@ ging changes to personal development and friendship that acts on our mental health much more pro@@ found@@ ly .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated , money can really not be purchased .
the beauty of Friends was that this focusing on my head was placed .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality who led to the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ or of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler Frequ@@ ent U@@ mar@@ bles , Mom@@ ents at football gu@@ esses in cozy arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can stay on any case , even if they often withdraw their feelings to explore completely their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the telephone past@@ oral care of me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my list@@ eners for people who feel de@@ pressed and are self @-@ vulner@@ able , has really shown to me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us are often not able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ancient Bible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come quite righ@@ tly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness , when you talk about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
music is one of the shows that I have to offer in my mind if I try to offer long @-@ term etching mechanisms .
it presents clearly the little moments of male friend@@ ships .
so very my objective outw@@ ard status about the phone must help people in moments of desp@@ air , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you want to visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ ship Fest arrives at the celebration of the day completely redesigned setting , why do not take your friends at a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better when you car@@ do@@ cks in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what the difference could make your friendship .
friends will be broadcast on Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - throughout 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ ship Fest
di Maria meets the PS@@ G to help Malmö in powder
angel Di Mary celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his match against Malmö .
the Maria tou@@ ches on Tuesday at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps to make PS@@ G , to Malmö .
here are the Game Report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani know course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain had launched its Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of the Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G @-@ player , which brought the French champion on the way , but afterwards it missed a number of opportunities before it finally achieved a head ball@@ ast as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A needs a strong start against the Swedish masters , since they are not just increasing the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quar@@ terly on each of the last three camp@@ ings .
but while they got the points , it was not a class@@ room by Laurent Bl@@ anc@@ as Team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ him@@ ov@@ ics . it later became in the game against his home town team and against the club , with which he started to illustr@@ ate his lively career in 1999 .
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or back@@ wards in the Champions League . so it &apos;s a good start to create and relaxing our opponents , even if there are certain things we have to have been perf@@ ecting in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc demanded .
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , even though I &apos;m sorry that we have not achieved one or two other doors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ibra@@ him@@ ovic returned to Paris @-@ Team for his injury to the Paris @-@ Team which took place at the weekend to Bordeaux in the First League , but he was pulled out in the fourth minute by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argentin@@ ian dealer was referred to as the man , the PS@@ G was taken over to the next level in Europe , when he entered in the last month by Manchester United when he entered in Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malmö defense before going to Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the multilingual network .
however , if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a big victory , it was disappointed .
in Malmö , the Cel@@ tic beat out at an Play @-@ off , joined by An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent passes .
but apart from a shot of Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who was far away from Kevin Tra@@ pp@@ s P@@ fo@@ sten in 34@@ minute , they b@@ ade little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G gave himself sometimes on , with some mis@@ sal foot and bad wast@@ es , not least by Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , who was at no less than five trials only in the first half , and then finally abandoned after the re@@ boot of Cav@@ ani .
nevertheless , he pointed out much more skills when he brought his participation in the game , and there was a pass of Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , Paul Di Mary , turned into a shot , which was hung up by Wil@@ derness at the last 5@@ 2nd minute ...
the second gate finally fell short after the 24 @-@ hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er achieved his sixth place of the season , after Mai@@ him@@ ovic had f@@ ished a left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well .
this ended all thoughts that in Malmö the game could fall , and only an outstanding sei@@ z@@ ure of wild to stop David Lu@@ iz , could keep the final result low before the replacement player Ez@@ equ@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi was able to detect a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave later that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian people said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have played only in the Swedish League , which did not have the same level .
the quali@@ fier are not enough . &quot;
hat from before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we speak of diversity , you do not do it with the occupation of the film and not with the occupation of the show &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Dam@@ on Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brown re@@ acted using a cre@@ dible un@@ belief and called &quot; HO@@ O ! Wow . al@@ right , &quot; when the comments of the actor from The Mar@@ ti@@ an arrived .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the production team Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to think of people to think about it - who will always be the director - as they deal with the figure of harmony , &quot; said Brown first .
the only black person , and she is a n@@ ut@@ te , which is defeated by her white p@@ hal@@ ves .

the contest , which had just completed her 7th season , had never experienced a competition participants , which could close all stages of his obst@@ acle course .
during the season it made two men , cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ ann Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten until the final .
the final task was climbing a climbing rope in a 75 @-@ foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten ended the task within the period where@@ with he was the first Ath@@ let , who finished the last stage 4 of American Ninja Warrior . but , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , making him vic@@ tor .
Cal@@ di@@ ero said with E ! News after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of the Great Prize of 1 Million $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it is aston@@ ishing to think about it , I have never earned some 10,000 $ or her life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his p@@ ile money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so all suddenly .. how I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leader producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the finals and why Brit@@ ten , although he finished first in at all at all , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , it won the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I do not believe that he swe@@ pt over it .
he has just done so happy to have done what he did .
he received signs of awards from fans .
he is like a great guy and a family Man .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I be struck by anyone , I &apos;m glad that he is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac &apos;d have the same felt when they had changed the rolls .
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for a few seasons , which will start shooting in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers spreading to Minnesota &apos;s Twin@@ s
MIN@@ NE@@ APO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ the second half of the season was for the Detroit Tig@@ ers not very funny .
earlier than one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers are standing on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as Sp@@ o@@ iler , however , this part played perfect against the Minnesota Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 in the Target Field .
the Twin@@ s applied a chance to asc@@ ension within a game of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card @-@ Platz .
for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word which was so difficult to set over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad P@@ mus .
Tiger Coun@@ cher , Alfredo Simon conducted his early offensive support than Detroit held three times in the first two lines , then once in the sixth and then once again in ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) scored 6 times in the 1 / 3 in@@ ings and made three inst@@ ances .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ do@@ zers of any game , and therefore I want to go into the game .
the designated tiger @-@ h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two rings , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game from Mart@@ ine@@ z since then he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sh@@ aken the storm well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said angr@@ ily . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( percussion training ) , it looked much better in the bul@@ l@@ do@@ zers , and it brought it right into the game .
with three branches of meeting at the end of the seventh month the Twin@@ s had their best chance to come back into the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double in the left hand line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a colourful , and Simon produced his second Bas@@ eman Brian do@@ ck@@ out , before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Hard@@ y .
Hard@@ y was over@@ going down by the only man to con@@ fron@@ ted the single man with whom he con@@ fron@@ ted R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ Head@@ man Miguel S@@ ano , the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a Two @-@ Run .
with a pair of buyers and the finale in the second , Ver@@ hagen came to play the third B@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe at a Double Play .
it was the major league the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe was a Double Play .
after Detroit added a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth time@@ ings , the wall managed a R@@ BI double against the cra@@ fting of the tiger to Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the sp@@ wick@@ s nevertheless left S@@ ano with three pitch for its fifth finish .
Detroit benef@@ ited from the start of the game by another Phil Hug@@ hes .
the tiger achieved three inst@@ ances in the first two inside against the right @-@ part veter@@ an who had been cancelled because of the battle of the injury @-@ ch@@ iefs , had missed more than a month before the sp@@ ill .
&quot; obviously not the beginning , which I desired myself , &quot; said Hug@@ hes , &quot; but I felt more happ@@ ier than I was trying to get a few good pit@@ cher there in the third inning . &quot;
after being received in the first half @-@ off B@@ atter , H@@ ush@@ es gave a single to Second Bas@@ ist Ian Kin@@ master .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z gave the game a single &quot; up the middle &apos; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z succeeded in his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing Position .
the third bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game , as he tried to go to the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers introduced the second one @-@ out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose on the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said Twin@@ s @-@ manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he had not struck well , but he caught the right spot .
Hug@@ hes found himself in a Pit@@ ch Count , and did not print points in the third inning , before he was replaced by the Ch@@ i@@ ever Just@@ ho@@ ever A.@@ J.@@ A@@ viewer .
in Hug@@ hes there was three inst@@ ances of hits with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
notes : tiger R@@ HP An@@ i@@ bal San@@ chez f@@ arewell for a violation of the root @-@ fault .
it is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 .

with San@@ chez provided in the game , L@@ HP is painted by Daniel Morris from the po@@ aching list to start the Twin@@ s .

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the leader of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; I believe that the f@@ arewell memory of military options may not take place without Germany , &quot; he said .
he threw the European states &quot; collective look . &quot;
four years ago it had been glad to give the cup of military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict erup@@ ted in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in German . &quot; &quot; &quot;

their destination is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and their Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU leaders .
on Sunday , Germany had started temporary border controls .
so far the EU states have not yet to agree on a joint approach in the crisis .

Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need to seek shelter this , too .
but those who do not consider any case of lead , could not remain in Germany too .
this conception was considered in the round .
the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or stressed that state as a whole must overcome a &quot; huge power requirement &quot; as a whole .
now , thousands of des@@ per@@ ate refugees have stuck together on the Balk@@ ans .

you started a global ocean under the earthquake of Saturn &apos;s Bad En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
the close researchers from observ@@ ations of the spac@@ ecraft is &quot; Cas@@ sini . &quot;

this design movement is only small but still too large for a thor@@ ough sk@@ age body , it is said in a communication of the Corn@@ ell university in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state of New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers are question@@ ing their studies in the branch &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; in front of them .

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his sl@@ ender , the same is often not subject to them .
for man@@ gan@@ ese contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
the exotic fruit is still healthy : in them B @-@ vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular contain man@@ gan@@ ese but much vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta car@@ ot@@ ene .
those who e@@ ats the fruits , thus supports lon@@ ging , immune system , and metab@@ olic processes in the body .
if you buy , Mang@@ os should not be soft , or have a pleasant smell .
the light colour alone does not say anything like the fruit is - so also green Mang@@ os are very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consume within less days .
then they taste of pure or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go has also a particular note .
she l@@ ugs the slightly bitter taste of short@@ fall such as Chic@@ o@@ ree and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
and a Mang@@ ro@@ ut@@ ney fits well to fish , poultry , lamb and wild animals .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ seat
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Prize in Rome .
in the presence of St. Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a far famous place in the park on the Opp@@ io @-@ Hill in the grounds of the German reform was christ@@ ened on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the nam@@ ing of the work was applied by the work community of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled that the Protest@@ ants were often living in the city of the Pop@@ es about centuries as minority often only in secret their belief .
with the place I become visible in symbolic sense that their tradition of Christian faith is in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held a couple of months in Rome as a young family mate at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 .

hammer artists and 3 years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gilded ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ rone ( gilded ) is one of the principal men painted by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ as has updated the introduction and Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not in the Ot@@ mar @-@ old Bible , which has been published with magnificent pictures now .
at the beginning the painting for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated his own personal interpretation of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 moti@@ ves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful paints and imag@@ in@@ ative forms the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has received - but this is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : the respective topics can result , this is quite a dark .
for three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked together on his entire Bible , which he made a sub@@ jective artistic selection out of the many subjects of the &quot; Book of All books . &quot;
arose have cycles , topics such as cross @-@ bil@@ lows , pl@@ agues , commandments , or pat@@ ern@@ ity .
in order to become spont@@ ane@@ ously as a number of partners : this is true for the Luther Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation , as well as for the Kettler house with its focus on art books .
and since is especially the author Klaus Al@@ te@@ as , who has dealt with the basis of painting with the particular Bible papers .
it was interpreted and translated by Ot@@ mar Alt selected Bible papers and so into the day of &quot; compiled . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirror of paintings of Al@@ ts painting .
embedded between the original Bible section of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formulated his own personal thoughts on the situation in particular .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows for a deep insight into his soul , his emot@@ ions .
that is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emot@@ ions ultimately became a medi@@ ator for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 , born in Wer@@ n@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Catholic Church in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing of up@@ bringing together with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to keep it up to carry me again with the Lord the Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second attempt was to save the art in rapid life time again : &quot; the perception of im@@ pet@@ us is marked by the Rek@@ l@@ ame , and it is no@@ isy .
symbol@@ ism will be displac@@ ed .
artists have a good desire and del@@ ights , things to show .
pictures have always a bit hidden and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants to bring the viewer into the pictures , &quot; let them leave , discover and feel that power it may have : &quot; the picture is to seek his counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post began on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ old Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; already for a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art , &quot; I like to understand with his pictures . &quot;
old did not de@@ comp@@ ose to assess the Bible , but which are important for him , too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not working at an eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ te@@ as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text can be explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this work is an invitation for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from the Luther Verlag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and screen printing is presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on the 15th of November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
plans made , place found , companies set sail for a circuit of circuit : one year later , almost everything was finished - but still before the official opening of the BM@@ X track there was already at the end .
fail@@ ures in politics and administration , especially with the residents who would not suffer the railway .
so hills moved up new space - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the permit was going to enter in October , the first Municipal Coun@@ cill@@ or of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock was now included in the child &apos;s child and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year seems to look more visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; additional commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool we started . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundesliga starts a significant sign on the weekend .
the football re@@ acts to the prev@@ ailing situation in Germany and backs up politics to tackle the upcoming problems .
&quot; I have kept this for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say there in principle , no one believes me , I have nothing to do with this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this one has to get an interest in the handle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang K@@ ear@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to trans@@ form the refugee situation in Germany inten@@ sively .
&quot; I am next Wednesday at the Kanz@@ ler@@ amt and meet there the State Minister Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ uz and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; the theme will play a central role , &quot; he quit .
the football could be and wool .
the decisive turn@@ outs has to put the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association therefore has its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; via the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun we have ensured that this programme will run until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ren@@ bach declared on the si@@ del@@ ines of the UEFA Session in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also some of the Bundesliga support this program .
already during this weekend , the 36 pro@@ fi@@ ves put a clear sign on the stamp to the left tri@@ k@@ ot@@ ee instead of the otherwise common Spon@@ sor@@ en@@ ary ( Hermes ) - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make sure that all of them can help , where and as they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen emblem Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee team is definitely going away , no one can see &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can use football pitch , no , we must use our radiation power to help our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees too , &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ net .
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League &quot; .
this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European quali@@ fier against Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ren@@ bach appe@@ ased the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license companies had started own projects in their places was great .
the same is that small and smallest associations active there .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; whom we have spent is lived in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this and next year , the association has provided 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees in cooperation with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unions have sum@@ mon@@ ed the whole sum in 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported ren@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Robotics cars : government wants to get a leading role for Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany is expected to change technological pione@@ ers after the government &apos;s change .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which fore@@ sees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the outskirts of the Autom@@ ated IAA in a &quot; new mobile age . &quot;
the automated driving force will increase traffic safety and ensure less st@@ out , Do@@ brin@@ dt said .
he also aims to discuss the subject also with his counter@@ part from the G7 states that come together with representatives from industry at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport , among others , emphas@@ ises the importance of the mobile broad@@ band structure and an average transfer to digital radio broadcasting .
the test is now a test run on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not have an additional adhesive tape &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to verify the Federal Government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; verify the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to custom@@ ize the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , Germany wants to use itself internationally that the maximum permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h .
Moreover , the Federal Government also aims to deplo@@ y the Vienna Convention , which has so far been en@@ vis@@ aged for the people to date .
when automated driving takes over by car , the car will take advantage of the driver , the driver will be more and more to passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and processing data in seconds .
following a study by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on high@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , driving vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still can expect from 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location in Germany estimate the authors of the study by 2025 at approx . 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road transport , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD @-@ traffic critic S@@ ör@@ en Bart@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question of liability in accidents and security of personal data of the driver must be clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars will see more sk@@ ep@@ tical - much more than the French or Americans .
one on Wednesday at the AA @-@ covered survey of the For@@ sa Institute in order of the test organization DE@@ K@@ RA comes to the result that only eight percent of the German believe that autonomous cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent expect that 31 percent do not believe it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those survey@@ ed by 2025 , with autonomous driving cars , are currently 33 percent .
in fact , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to leave to leave their self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
according to a screening of the digital@@ ization Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree that control throughout the entire trip on all roads .
on the fre@@ eway , these traffic can think at least 15 percent in flowing traffic , at St@@ au 45 percent .
good each v@@ ester would leave the car under no circumstances .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are strong enough to pick up the title also without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said good@@ bye to Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the dis@@ advantage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not just like a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gaul@@ tier doesn &apos;t feel at old for an end ?
it is a mixture of very large fashion show and a Wach@@ s@@ ware @-@ Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaulle ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
highlights highlights : man@@ nequ@@ in man@@ nequ@@ in , thanks to video projec@@ tions .

&quot; I can no longer say that I am the du@@ f@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was very simple , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &apos; ( From the side@@ walk to the Cat@@ walk ) , which is on the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle of the hyp@@ o culture foundation , it is a good fortune to have changed his start to a vision of his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He would have a little bit to death for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , one comes to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made in Montreal , Canada as well as in Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly noticeable work of man , written in fashion history , without ever having completed a training .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed house , for which much effort was operated : to cut the d@@ olls , a styl@@ ist activ@@ ist , for example , a styl@@ ist .
14 tons of material delivered the makers according to the curator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gaul@@ &apos;s old Teddy was too visible in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ely fashi@@ onable appearance of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good pup@@ il and bad in football ) he had attracted his Teddy B@@ HS and clothes , said the Gaul@@ tier .
with a doll to play , his parents would not have allowed him to access him .

jewelry instead of Gard@@ ins - Pl@@ au@@ ger tip as fashion niche
previously it went to the long stit@@ ch@@ es@@ cal@@ ing machines in and around pl@@ au@@ ght , meters to make .
the embroi@@ dered materials and tips were produced in large quantities for customers who worked for example for bl@@ ank@@ ets and curtains .
today , the alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ th@@ ines .
instead the fashion is important again .
in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener top has played a major role , but was displac@@ ed through the Heim@@ tex@@ til@@ ting industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt is a few examples : tip in jewelry , accessories such as bags and for regional cost@@ umes .
even so , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which is bor@@ row@@ ed on past st@@ ep@@ ilep@@ sy , is an increasing order potential .
he does not use any niche in the textile branch in Germany anymore , is no longer on the market .
by us , they already make up half of all contracts .
mo@@ th@@ ell Pl@@ ate is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener top and embroi@@ der@@ ies together with nine other companies .
only they must wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , roughly 80 percent of sales are affected .
private trade stores and also wholesale there are almost no longer .
our products are hardly visible by the customer in this way .
the mass goods are manufactured in the Asian region so much cheaper and distributed almost entirely about chains .
further export of export , currently under Russia and the USA .
so there &apos;s enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tried to score points as Cord@@ ula Bauer from the stit@@ ch stone in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year , we have been producing a quality seal , which shows that we produce organic and soci@@ ally toler@@ able . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma thesis in U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berg out@@ line of the German Sax@@ on Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is speci@@ alis@@ ing in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
to deal closer to the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
this produces a voltage field between the refresh@@ est ideas of designer and designers who need to think particularly econom@@ ically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , a existing design often weighs only slightly , to keep a customer &apos;s strain .
some years ago animated textile artists Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ discovered the historic snow of snow .
embroi@@ dered the machine at some places little ch@@ ill@@ ets .
the pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ e@@ dem@@ on Bianca H@@ all@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ se had inspired him : &quot; previously , I couldn &apos;t start with traditional pl@@ au@@ ders . &quot;
now they use the sn@@ eb@@ all@@ top for your jewelry .
they shaped the pattern in a complex procedure .
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener top - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter .
they also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to the customer , whose ancestors used to be in the plant@@ ing and surroundings , and they would like to have a mem@@ ento .
with this I see my Je@@ wel@@ s as a modern ambassador for pl@@ au@@ ener .

&quot; &quot; &quot; it seems to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Weekly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not for a re@@ spiration , but for a kind of continuation of the 20 years after the first film with magical child . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government also will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lock@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies and ensuring that company will decide how they perform their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;

EU wants to double mercury @-@ limit in bo@@ at@@ fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values of mercury in big cat@@ fish and to obtain significantly higher dose of ner@@ ve gifts .
the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who is a corresponding working draft of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans sharp@@ ly : &quot; risks and adverse events are answered with full force of pregnant and infants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf schmi@@ dt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt states that the mar@@ g@@ inal values of the ner@@ ve gi@@ ants should be raised at the end of the food chain such as Hai@@ - or wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons , &quot; from one to two milli@@ gram of mercury per kilogram of fish .
large space @-@ fish already are so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury , that on the basis of still applicable limit values approximately 50 percent of the catch is not sold .
and afterwards , after dou@@ bling the bound@@ ary values , only 14.5 percent would be to be cured .
in turn to this loos@@ ening the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values with other fishes from about 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ gram of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch den@@ ds this , but as &quot; tri@@ ck &quot; because smaller do@@ ve fishes are usually so low that they will already keep the planned maximum values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the re@@ mark in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ adventure of de@@ fle@@ ction man@@ eu@@ vers , which helps in the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy heavy metal heavy metal , which strongly car@@ es about the food chain especially in the fish @-@ fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government is therefore warned that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts particularly on the n@@ atives of the nervous system could be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares its respec@@ ting the highest @-@ reaching indications , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no means of health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly found by coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written document by the Federal Ministry of Technology Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bo@@ ck , the German coal power plants placed more than six tons of mercury in the year , em@@ itted two thirds of the total population in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish approximately in Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanent and widespread use &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; had quoted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March out of paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , European war@@ nings regarding mercury in fish already existed for the most reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
