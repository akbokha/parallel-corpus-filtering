the following requirements for the efficacy of Ser@@ a on the determination of the R@@ H Group may change if international standard prepar@@ es are provided . ( i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum will be gained from the blood of a or more of several persons , which are immune by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ H @-@ Systems .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not included in human white blood cells that are not included in the an@@ tigen D .
the whole anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0,@@ 9@@ cent sodium sal@@ ine solution .

in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells , which include the an@@ tigen D , the serum to don@@ ate blood cells should react to the possibility of blood cells .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , who are intended to use the object carrier according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , have to be mixed with a same amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ percent more out of C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells , within 30 seconds of the visible ag@@ glut@@ ination , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be fully complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum will be gained from the blood of a or more of several persons , which are immune by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ H @-@ Systems .
it re@@ acts with flo@@ ods of human blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen , but not containing human @-@ blood cells that are not included in the C @-@ an@@ tigen .
this Ser@@ a is therefore specific to the C @-@ an@@ tigen only if the tested blood cells were fired in a 0,@@ 9@@ cent sodium sal@@ ine solution .
the ti@@ ter of the anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ d@@ dee blood cells .

the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immune cells or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective under the manufacturer specified in response conditions at the same time .
it is a serum to use with the test according to diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , in order to show the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation time in all types of red blood cells that show a reaction , not less than in the most frequent antibodies .

in fact that the executive committee was approved for the Convention on its second conference , reducing the annual emissions of nitrogen oxide , and the need that states that states had already achieved progress in reducing emissions of reducing emissions by reducing emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des and reduce emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des .
considering the existing research and technical data on emissions , air movements and effects of nitrogen oxi@@ des and impact products to the environment and data on technologies for the control of emissions ,
determined , effective measures to control and decre@@ asing the annual National emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des or their gr@@ en@@ inated greenhouse gas emissions , in particular by application of appropriate national emission thresh@@ olds for new moving sources , as well as retro@@ fitting of existing external sources ,
in knowledge that the scientific and technical knowledge about these questions are further develop and that this development is to be taken into account of the application of this protocol , and in favour of further measures take into account .
in the knowledge that the preparation of a critical solution based on the critical assessment is the creation of an effective scientific basis for the objective of application of this protocol , and in decision to take into account the decision to take into account more internationally .
in the knowledge that the verification of procedure for creating low conditions for a technology exchange is to contribute to a effective reduction in emissions of nit@@ ric oxide in the region of the Commission .
with comra@@ des to the knowledge , several states are obliged to make their annual national emissions of nit@@ ric oxide to increase its annual National emissions of nitrogen oxide and to a considerable extent .
the measures taken by some states already taken the measures to cut emissions of nitrogen oxide emissions to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide .
