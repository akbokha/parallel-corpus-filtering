it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets , which dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution ( 1 mg / ml ) and as a solution for injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ res Thin@@ k and Spre@@ chen , Hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or sin@@ king of things that are not available ) , an psychological condition where the patients had man@@ ical episodes ( periods of interest ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal tuning .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ical episodes and to prevention man@@ ical episodes in patients who are used in the past .
the injection solution is applied to the fast control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ ors disorders if the medicine intake of the medicine is not possible .
in both cases , the solution can be applied to one or the melting tabl@@ ets in patients with different diseases , where the gor@@ ges of tablets has been prepared .
in patients who take other drugs used at the same time , the same as Abi@@ ci@@ fy , should be adapted to the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neuro@@ log@@ istic &quot; ( i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of the nerve cells each .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is probably due to a &quot; partial Ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for Neuro@@ sur@@ geon D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( also ser@@ ot@@ onin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ stes such as 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in the larger dimensions as the neuro@@ log@@ ist , to activate the recept@@ ors .
as D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine in schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar failure to play Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain to norm@@ alize psycho@@ tic or man@@ ische symptoms .
the efficacy of Abi@@ ci@@ fy , the re@@ occur of symptoms , was investigated in three studies across up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was carried out in two studies in 805 patients with schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered an increas@@ ement of two hours over a period of two hours .
in another study , Abi@@ ci@@ fy was set up on 12 weeks of 347 patients with Hal@@ li@@ fy , in a other study conducted by Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo , in which the man@@ ian symptoms had already been stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ an fy injection solution was suffered in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar error , which suffered by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ therapy ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the change of symptoms in patients using a standard scale of bi@@ polar failure or the number of patients who are applied to treatment .
the company also led studies thanks to investigate how the body the melting tray and the solution can be res@@ or@@ bed ( put into effect ) .
in both studies with the injection solution showed patients who received Abi@@ ci@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.6 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms increased than the patients who received placebo .
in case of use of bi@@ polar failure , Abi@@ li@@ fy decreased in four of five short @-@ term symptoms and more effective as placebo .
in addition , and up to 74 weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy himself served as placebo for a placebo episodes in previously treated patients and if it was in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses have also more effective than placebo the symptoms increased and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side @-@ effects of Abi@@ ci@@ fy problems ( measured motion ) , head@@ aches , wor@@ shi@@ ppers ( loss of motion ) , cut@@ aneous water ( increased storage production ) , fatigue , and exhaus@@ tion ( increased storage production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , back@@ light effect , in@@ som@@ nie ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety .
the European Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ia ( CH@@ MP ) , which had severe adverse episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I failure and in which the man@@ ical episodes were found on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ro@@ z@@ ole , compared to the risks .
in addition , the committee also came to the outcome that the advantages of the inj@@ ectors of inj@@ ections and behavi@@ ors of patients with schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ polar episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I error is not suitable , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted to the Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a approval for the placing on the market of Abi@@ ci@@ fy in the entire European Union .
A@@ BI@@ L@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of a severe episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ ion and for prevention of a new episode of patients who had mostly man@@ ical episodes and their man@@ ical episodes were said to treat with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ BI@@ L@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily from meals .
the effectiveness of do@@ si@@ ties with a daily dose of 15 mg has been detected , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ BI@@ L@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , irrespective of meals as a single agent or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of A@@ BI@@ L@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected .
with regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initi@@ ating dose should be moved into account when clinical factors ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ induc@@ tor made of the combination therapy should be reduced to the recommended dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ cro@@ iss@@ al behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders according to a anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , in some cases , in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of a epidemi@@ ological study showed that it was not increased in patients with bi@@ polar error . no increased Su@@ pper in comparison to other Anti@@ psycho@@ sis compared to other Anti@@ psycho@@ tic .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease , heart failure , trans@@ duc@@ tive disease , conditions that are applied for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( Deh@@ y@@ dr@@ at@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure reduc@@ ers ) or hypertension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 late @-@ dy@@ ak@@ in@@ esien : in clinical trials , which a year or less di@@ gest , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole @-@ law Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia .
if in case of an A@@ BI@@ L@@ IF@@ Y treated patients signs and symptoms of a late @-@ ra@@ dy@@ in@@ esia , should be drawn to reduce the dose or to break the treatment .
if one patient signs and symptoms developed on a m@@ NS , or un@@ clear fever without any additional clinical manifest@@ ation of M@@ NS , must be set all anti@@ psycho@@ sis , including A@@ BI@@ L@@ IF@@ Y .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ ro@@ z@@ ole should be used in patients with det@@ ri@@ fl@@ es in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or cra@@ ck that can be applied with caution .
56 - 99 years of age with arias was associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients were treated with the Alzheimer &apos;s disease , a higher risk of death were treated compared to placebo .
however , in one of these studies , a study with fi@@ xer dosing , a significant relationship between the dosage and the appeal of un@@ adverse events with Ari@@ pi@@ ro@@ benzene .
hyper@@ gly@@ co@@ mia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ capaci@@ tive or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar com@@ a or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs , including A@@ BI@@ L@@ IF@@ Y .
there is no precise risk assessment for Hyper@@ gly@@ co@@ mia @-@ related training events with A@@ BI@@ L@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic patients treated with direct adjusting .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ ite , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally used in schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia based on com@@ or@@ bi@@ ties , in which weight gain as a secondary effect is observed , respectively , and could lead to severe comp@@ lications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system is the particular caution offered when Ari@@ pi@@ ro@@ z@@ ole in combination with alcohol or other non @-@ effective drugs used ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ ant@@ agonist F@@ amo@@ ti@@ dine , a mag@@ ic acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resistance rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not relevant as a clin@@ ically .
in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers an highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibitor ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole to 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to expect that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , like Flu@@ ox@@ e@@ tin and Par@@ ox@@ e@@ tin , similar effects and that , similar measurements should be carried out .
for CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ is@@ ite , the joint application can result with highly effective inhibitor of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher Plas@@ ma@@ ker@@ ings in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
if you decide the treatment of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , with A@@ BI@@ L@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should not exceed the potential risks for the patients .
other highly effective inhibitor of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor , are similar effects and therefore similar measurements should be carried out .
according to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibitor , the dosage of A@@ BI@@ L@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the Dos@@ ish@@ ess before the start of the accompanying therapy .
di@@ ti@@ ac@@ em or Esc@@ ol@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are administered jointly with A@@ BI@@ L@@ IF@@ Y , can be converted with a standard increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .

the patients should happen to al@@ ert their doctor when they are pregnant , or pregnancy , during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the inadequate data to security in the animal studies , this medication should not be applied in pregnancy , unless the possible benefit of jus@@ ti@@ fies the potential risk of the fet@@ us .
however , the patients with other anti@@ psycho@@ therapy should be warned of non @-@ dangerous machines , including strength vehicles , to operate , until they are safe that Ari@@ pi@@ es had no negative impact on them .
the following side effects occur more often than placebo ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) as a possible medi@@ cally relevant effects ( * ) :
the frequency of below side effects is defined by the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .

in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ controlled trials ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 228 schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enic patients showed positive or negative symptoms compared to placebo a statistically significant improvement of psycho@@ tic symptoms .
in a half of the controlled study controlled study in a 52 percent share of the Respon@@ sibility of patients who held a response to study medication in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ co dol 73 % ) .
current values of Mess@@ r@@ ational , which were defined as secondary school targets , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ es @-@ scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ res@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate of 34 % in the Ari@@ ro@@ benzene group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ an in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ia ( N = 18 or 13 % of the evalu@@ able patients ) in significantly less patients receiving a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg at an average weight of approximately 5.6 kg ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therapy studies with more flexible dosage of 3 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo effect on placebo for over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therapy study over 3 weeks with fi@@ xer dosing with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I failure , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no longer than placebo .
in two placebo @-@ controlled single @-@ controlled mono@@ therapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ical or mixed episode , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed an increase in placebo effect in week 3 and a restra@@ int effects that was comparable with lithium or Hal@@ co dol in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole discovered in week 12 a comparable portion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic remission of Man@@ ie to like lithium or Hal@@ co dol .

in an O@@ lan@@ an in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ia ( N = 18 or 13 % of the evalu@@ able patients ) in significantly less patients receiving a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg at an average weight of approximately 5.6 kg ) .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therapy study over 3 weeks with fi@@ xer dosing with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I failure , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no longer than placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics was compared to healthy subjects with 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ ping in tabl@@ eting in tabl@@ eting in tablets , the ratio between geomet@@ ric C@@ max and the value of tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
this was established by chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ an as a result of the expul@@ sion of sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ ju@@ ants in the G@@ all of monkeys after repeated treatment of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose when humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in case of rab@@ bits , these effects were according to do@@ si@@ ties , which led to the positions of the 3- and 11@@ fold of the middle Ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
A@@ BI@@ L@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is applied to the fast control of aging and code disorders in patients with schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ical episodes in the bi@@ polar @-@ I error . if a oral therapy cannot be attached .
once they are clin@@ ically attached , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ping injection solution can be completed and can be started using the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to minimize the res@@ or@@ ption and to minimize vari@@ ability , a inj@@ ector is recommended in the glut@@ in@@ to@@ us or deep in the glut@@ eus @-@ maximum us det@@ ectable by obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account for creating or ac@@ ut therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further leading treatment with arias is index@@ ed , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine via A@@ BI@@ L@@ IF@@ Y tablets , A@@ BI@@ L@@ IF@@ Y melting tray or A@@ BI@@ L@@ IF@@ Y solution .
there are no investigation into the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ anos injection solution in patients with A@@ gi@@ um and behavi@@ ors distur@@ ban@@ ces , which were different by schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes in the Bi@@ polar @-@ I error .
if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ odi@@ az@@ ep@@ ine in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ ping injection solution is necessary as necessary to be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure if needed ( see section 4.5 ) .
investigation into the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ oid injection solution for patients with alcohol or pharmaceutical poison@@ ing ( by described or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease , heart failure , trans@@ duc@@ tive disease , conditions that are applied for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( Deh@@ y@@ dr@@ at@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure reduc@@ ers ) or hypertension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) .
late @-@ dy@@ ak@@ in@@ esien : in clinical trials , which a year or less di@@ gest , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole @-@ law Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle stimul@@ ating , changing consciousness and signs of signs Inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ es , wit@@ es and heart rhyth@@ ms ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ ite , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally used in schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia based on com@@ or@@ bi@@ ties , in which weight gain as a secondary effect is observed , respectively , and could lead to severe comp@@ lications .
nevertheless the intensity of the Sed@@ ation had been larger compared to the treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in a study , in the healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg of dose ) , and were detected at the same time Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg of dose ) and intra@@ mus@@ cular disease .
105 The H2 @-@ ant@@ agonist F@@ amo@@ ti@@ dine , a mag@@ ic acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resistance rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not relevant as a clin@@ ically .
for CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ is@@ ier@@ ers , the common use of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 was resulting in higher Plas@@ ma@@ ker@@ ings of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibitor of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor , are similar effects and therefore similar measurements should be carried out .
according to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibitor , the dosage of A@@ BI@@ L@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the Dos@@ ish@@ ess before the start of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg of dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cular , was the intensity of Sed@@ ation larger compared to the treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following side effects occur in clinical trials with arias @-@ sur@@ ized injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) as a possible medi@@ cally relevant effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of below side effects is defined by the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 And the following side effects occur more often than placebo ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo . they were classified as possible medi@@ cally @-@ relevant effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled study controlled over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
during long @-@ term development phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients with placebo @-@ controlled treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potential clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters found , did not measure medi@@ cally significant differences .
construction of the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ phosp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and tor@@ mented symptoms , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ ro@@ benzene were observed , compared to 2.0 % of placebo patients .
effects on the side @-@ side effects can occur in connection with a anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , the mal@@ ig@@ y neuro@@ tic syndrome , sp@@ inal cu@@ cum@@ ulative events and increased mortality in older de@@ men@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ co@@ mia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ ors inter@@ ferences was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution with statistically significant improvements of A@@ gi@@ mic and code disorders compared to placebo and was similar to the bracket .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial period ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar failure as well as aromatic disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ anos injection was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms in comparison to placebo and impair@@ ment disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - Reference arm .
the mean improvement of the output value at the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Comp@@ onent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour end was 5.8 for placebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of under@@ lines in patients with mixed further episodes or patients with severe A@@ gi@@ ants , a similar effectiveness in relation to the total population was observed , but a statistical Sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ kan@@ z was observed due to a reduced patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ controlled trials ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 228 schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enic patients showed positive or negative symptoms compared to placebo a statistically significant improvement of psycho@@ tic symptoms .
in a half of the controlled study controlled study in a 52 percent share of the Respon@@ sibility of patients who held a response to study medication in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ operating tower 73 % ) .
current values of measurement results , which were defined as secondary school targets , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression @-@ scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ res@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate of 34 % in Ari@@ pi@@ de@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ an in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ia ( N = 18 or 13 % of the evalu@@ able patients ) significantly less than a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg at an average weight of about 5.6 kg ) .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ orial or mixed episode , partly over 2 weeks not to li@@ thi@@ cker or Val@@ pro@@ ate mono@@ therap@@ ist , revealed the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a negative effect for mono@@ therapy , compared to mono@@ therapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole performed a remission compared to placebo superior to placebo superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar case , predominantly with the prevention of a return .
the Ari@@ pi@@ stes AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after intra@@ mus@@ cular injection 90 % larger the AU@@ C according to the same dose as tabl@@ ette ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the medium time until reaching the maximum plasma screens at 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ ping injection solution was transferred from rats and monkeys , and resulted in any direct toxicity of a target post at an systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
in studies for the refin@@ ement application according to intraven@@ ous application , there are no safety relevant concerns to mat@@ ern@@ aler exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for security sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxicity and treatment , gen@@ ot@@ oxi@@ fication and to kan@@ o@@ gens the pre @-@ clinical data were not visible special risks for humans .
To@@ xi@@ k@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in do@@ si@@ ties or ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; therefore they have not limited for the clinical application only limited or no significance .
effects on reducing a dos@@ ed @-@ dependent activation command ( AU@@ C ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose of humans ( AU@@ C ) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times of the medium @-@ state @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of humans ( AU@@ C ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis developed by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ ole in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repe@@ tition of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose when humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , the effects of do@@ si@@ ties were observed , which led to the positions of the 3 and 11 times of the medium @-@ state of AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

viewed only the patients who received for the first time due to metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference in terms of efficacy indicators such as time until the deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival no difference between the medicine .
in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators , Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective as conventional pac@@ litaxel @-@ medicine .
in addition , it may not be applied to people who have low neutr@@ ality or before the treatment of low neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ s in the blood .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reported that Abra@@ x@@ ane was unable to recover more effective than conventional pac@@ litaxel fluorescent medicines , and that it would not be given to other pac@@ litaxel with other drugs to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a licence for the placing on the market of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mono@@ therapy is index@@ ed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ency &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or more ) or he@@ y@@ or@@ ations of neu@@ ropath@@ y during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
the sens@@ ory Neu@@ ropath@@ y degree 3 is the treatment to break up to Grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no proper data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with mild to regular impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4th and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies of patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and currently there is no proper data to the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for the application of children under 18 years due to sufficient data for diss@@ em@@ ination and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ made nan@@ op@@ en- formulated by pac@@ litaxel , who could have significant other ph@@ armac@@ ological characteristics as other formulation of pac@@ litaxel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if a allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be reset immediately and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment started , and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ litaxel .
in patients , no further Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated by the neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ es again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and increased the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ count again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function ( bi@@ li@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / ALT &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a mix with Abra@@ x@@ ane in relation to car@@ di@@ ot@@ oxi@@ fication was not unusual , cardiovascular inci@@ dents in the Indian patient lessons are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycline @-@ treatment or underlying cardiac or Lun@@ ar condition .
in case of patients with the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vomiting and diar@@ rhe@@ a , these are treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ eti@@ ka and con@@ junc@@ tival .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be practic@@ ed at vibrations or women in the age of age , which is not effective to be applied , except for the treatment of mother with pac@@ litaxel is essential .
women in the age @-@ reaching age should use a reliable lock method for up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , is stimul@@ ates , whereas , and up to six months after treatment not have a child .
male patients should be advised before the treatment through a sper@@ ma@@ infra@@ me , because the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of very serious ir@@ reversible effects .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like fatigue ( very frequently ) and dizziness ( often ) that can be found on the transportation and ability to serve the ability of machines .
the following is the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side @-@ side effects , which was performed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated to 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane &apos;s investigational clinical phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most striking major hem@@ ological toxicity ( in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly re@@ reversible and dos@@ ed . leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of patients with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients and was in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .

the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is treated by data of 106 patients in two in@@ ar@@ dy in@@ separ@@ ating studies and of 45@@ 4 patients treated in a randomised phase III study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer , Abra@@ x@@ ane , treated with a dose of 175 mg / m2 was given in the form of an in@@ fusion .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 is used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ centric study was carried out in patients with pac@@ litaxel , who received pac@@ litaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 229 ) .
in the recording in the study , 64 % of patients had a imp@@ aired General condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had visual metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ ellen .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed a biological medicine similar to the European Union ( EU ) , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference book &quot; ) .
in case of patients with normal blood flow values , if in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion comp@@ lications could not occur if the procedure is not possible and where a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a medical doctor who has an experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and patients who want to be inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his Betreu@@ ungs@@ er@@ son , unless you received a reasonable guide .
in patients with chronic kidney disease in patients or in patients who received chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al values always should lie within the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per Dec@@ il@@ ites in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
iron values of all patients are to control the treatment to ensure that no iron man@@ gel is given , and iron pipes should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients who received chemotherapy or chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , it is caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel , that the body is not sufficient to the body &apos;s own Ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
in addition , ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also applied to increase the number of blood cells to raise the result of a blood reduction .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was applied to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to administration as inj@@ ectors in a v@@ ein in the context of a major study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all of this study participating patients was inj@@ ected at least eight weeks in E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ein inj@@ ected before they were added to Ab@@ se@@ amed or still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main Indian indicator for effectiveness was the change of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in between the beginning of the study and the trial period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also submitted a study on the effects of a study in which effects of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o with 114 cancer patients were examined for cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study of patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in were recorded in the same dimensions as for those who received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients showed that E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received a rise of 0,0@@ 63 g / dl on the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common secondary effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can lead to sympt@@ om of an@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as ab@@ rupt , rep@@ lication of migrants and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed cannot be applied in patients , the possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or one of the other components are used .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as inj@@ ectors under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems because additional studies are required to ensure that this means no allergic reactions are triggered .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) observed that the medicine was approved by a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile like E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , which puts the se@@ amed , will provide medical staff in all Member States information , including information on the safety of the drug .

an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ s by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) should be avoided over a period of four weeks .
due to the vari@@ ability of patients , occasionally can be observed in a patient individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al values above or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ ability should be tried to reach hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mol / l ) .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used for the treatment of the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a illness that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both for women after the years as well as men .
it is applied in patients with a high density of risk ( bone di@@ ps ) , including in patients who have suffered a lower portion of a reduction ; • Mor@@ bus P@@ age@@ t of bone transplan@@ t , a illness that changes the normal rate of bone growth .
in addition to patients with Mor@@ bus P@@ age@@ t at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days prior to the treatment ; patients with envel@@ opes should be obtained from the first in@@ fusion a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or by inj@@ ector into a nut@@ shell .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( mean against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can reduce symptoms such as fever , muscle p@@ ains , gri@@ pp@@ ings similar symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus P@@ age@@ t , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta rating .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it was investigated by the number of verteb@@ rates and hip cultures over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which recently had a fraction of frac@@ ture over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus P@@ age@@ t , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two trials for a total of 35@@ 7 patients and six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ ates ) .
the main Indian agent for effectiveness was the effectiveness of the alkaline phosphor@@ us in the serum ( an enzyme , which builds a reduction in bone , or at least 75 % against the output value .
in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rates were reduced by Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ cs ) over a period of three years compared to placebo by 70 % .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ cs ) , those under placebo was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after the in@@ fusion and are less common with repeated in@@ fusion .
Ac@@ la@@ sta not may not be used in patients , the possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or one of the other components are used .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ ates , patients at Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to risk of kidney cancer , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis ( die of bone tissue ) in the pine .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta offers re@@ conn@@ aissance material for doctors who need Ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients who will be explained in the effects of the drug using the drugs and on it , when it should apply to the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the Company Nov@@ arti@@ s Europ@@ ite Limited granted a approval for the placing of Ac@@ la@@ sta in the entire European Union .

treatment of Oste@@ opor@@ osis • by post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with a increased risk for frac@@ tions , including in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic belt .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg of acet@@ la@@ sta is recommended every year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip , the administration of acet@@ la@@ sta is recommended for two or more weeks after operational supply of the stro@@ kes ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus P@@ age@@ t , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus P@@ age@@ t .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus P@@ age@@ t with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long r@@ low emission period was observed in patients who are based on therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient amount of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip , an initi@@ ating dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ate or intra@@ mus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended on the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by gift of acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen after the application of acet@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney function ( see section 4.4 ) At patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended , since limited clinical experiences for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and Eli@@ mination of older patients were similar to younger patients .
children and adol@@ esc@@ sta is not recommended for the application of children and adol@@ esc@@ ents under 18 years , as data is missing on the conc@@ ub@@ ility and efficacy .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney disease ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) as well as for these patient population only limited clinical experiences .
a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ oc@@ ene is sufficient at the start of therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta by sufficient material of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the fast implementation of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid on bone de@@ formation , a temporary work can develop under sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ thesis whose maximum usually takes place within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of acet@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient amount of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad breath ( hygiene ) should be driven by using a tooth @-@ pre@@ di@@ ver dental treatment .
for patients who require the dental acc@@ esses , no data are available , whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates , reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the jaw .
the clinical assessment of the treating doctor should be based on treatment plan of any patients and are based on an individual no @-@ risk assessment .
the incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by gift of acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of acet@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of adverse effects of pre@@ hop@@ ing was increased in patients who received Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % ) in comparison to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent frac@@ ture trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the total stress of inci@@ dents between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2,6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse impacts are listed in Table 1 .
kidney dys@@ function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney dys@@ function ( i.e. an increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases reported as acute kidney failure .
the change of cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( yearly prior to administration ) and the occurrence of kidney disease were comparable to oste@@ opor@@ osis in a clinical trial between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and placebo group .
a temporary increase of serum cre@@ atine in@@ ins within 10 days of the gift was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta treated patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo patients .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory , the temporary evaluation of calcium @-@ values carried out below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) in the patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical trial , compared to 21 % of patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ P@@ age@@ t studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical question@@ able after a stro@@ kes and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ P@@ age@@ t studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical question@@ able , the majority of vitamin D levels were measured without rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of patients received an initial dosage of vitamin D to the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical trial was reported to the in@@ fusion office , such as Roman , swelling and / or pain , reports ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the jaw area for athletes was allowed to report oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid .
many of these patients had the signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of the reports refers to cancer @-@ extraction and other dental extraction .
7 study with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients performed oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis in the jaw area with Ac@@ la@@ sta and in a placebo patients treated with placebo patients .
in case of over@@ do@@ zation , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ oc@@ ene , can be achieved through the gift of oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .

effects on morph@@ omet@@ ric verteb@@ rates are significantly over a period of three years and already after a year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ rates ( see table 2 ) .
in patients with acet@@ la@@ sta treatment in patients and older had 60 % reduced risk for verteb@@ rates compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.@@ 0001 ) .
effects on hip @-@ fraction Ac@@ la@@ sta showed a constant effects of three years , which resulted in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for hip fra@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased the bone density in Len@@ den@@ wir@@ ling acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment ( 6 , 12 , 24 , and 36 months ) .
9 increas@@ ement of the bone density of the Len@@ den@@ o@@ il@@ ine reduced by 6.7 % , the total mass by 6.0 % , the sc@@ ans at around 5.@@ 1 % and the dist@@ al radius at 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ o@@ tic patients who were treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ ties were taken .
a micro@@ computer @-@ tom@@ ographic - ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed in comparison with Ac@@ la@@ sta treated patients compared to placebo a increase in bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone markers of phosphor@@ ous @-@ specific alkaline ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale Pro@@ pep@@ ti@@ d of type @-@ I@@ - coll@@ agen ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) , serum and serum beta @-@ C Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) , were measured in a lower interval of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 of patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP to 12 months in comparison to the output value and was held at 28 % below the output value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value and was kept at 52 % below the initial amount to 36 months .
the B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and has been kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirrors were measured without rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. oral or intra@@ mus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the placebo group , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment increased the BM@@ D for the placebo treatment and to all time points .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led over 24 months in comparison to placebo treatment to an increase in the BM@@ D by 5.4 % at the total sales and 4.3 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als .
clinical efficacy in men in the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were randomized to randomised and evaluated in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction of clinical frac@@ tions in men ; the incidence of clinical question@@ tures was 7.5 % at Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men in comparison to 8.7 % in placebo .
in another study by men ( trial CZ@@ O@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the annual administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was referring to the level of Al@@ la@@ sis in comparison to the level of the base @-@ e@@ bel BM@@ D after 24 months in comparison to the output value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment of ho@@ mi@@ sta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years ago ( mean serum levels of acid ) of alkaline phosphor@@ us ( mean serum levels of alkaline phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2,@@ 6@@ fold up to 3,@@ 0@@ fold @-@ specific mean value of the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ric acid compared to intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months , was detected in two six months comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain of pain and pain was observed in comparison to the output value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as a response in the six @-@ month trial as a Respon@@ sibility ( based on therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 @-@ treated patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , the therapeutic response could be treated with acet@@ la@@ sta , compared to 71 patients with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients and mean follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
one unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 , and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid at 64 patients resulted in the following ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved itself as dos@@ is@@ independent .
then the plasma centrifu@@ ged rapidly increased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ term phase , no more than 0.1 % of the highest value .
rapid bi@@ ochemi@@ cal disappearance from the large circulation system with half times ½ α @-@ 24 and t ½ h to 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with a termin@@ al elim@@ ination time of ½ hours to 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α @-@ up and the above ½ -@@ values ) represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and differentiation about the nuts .
in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose can be found in the urine , while the rest mainly is bound to a bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race , or body@@ weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron @-@ acid concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the area under the curve ( Plas@@ ma@@ concentration against time ) .
a reducing Clear@@ ance by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ ers met@@ ised substances is un@@ likely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abolic because they have a weak or ir@@ reversible , or ir@@ reversible , depending of dependent inhibit@@ ors of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this resulted in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function , up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid required .
as for severe kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ tic Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , these population are not possible .
acute toxicity The highest non @-@ let@@ tu@@ ition intraven@@ ous dose of mice was 10 mg / kg of body weight and rats 0.6 mg / kg of body weight .
in studies on dogs , single doses of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the recommended number of human therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without ren@@ al fun@@ nel .
sub@@ chronic and chronic To@@ xi@@ fication In studies with intraven@@ ous application of dose of 0,6 mg / kg , administered as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion pumps ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to 7@@ times of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repe@@ ti@@ ered use of cum@@ ulative ex@@ positions , the maximum of the intended Human Resources met with other organ@@ ics , including the Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tra@@ kt and the liver , as well as to the intraven@@ ous injection .
the most common concern and studies of trials with repeated application was an increase of primary bovine spongi@@ form in the growth period with almost all Do@@ si@@ ties , a command and , in the ph@@ armac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ o@@ tive effect of the substance .
in rats we observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( visual acuity ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
at rab@@ bits , no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embr@@ yo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the mat@@ ernal toxicity was reduced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of serum serum and calcium mirror .

Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a sub@@ distance class , the Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , the oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the murder of bone .
decre@@ asing blood level of ab@@ ro@@ gens , mainly est@@ ro@@ gens which are made from ro@@ gens , play a role in a rather gradu@@ al loss of bone mass , which is observed in men .
during Mor@@ bus P@@ age@@ t , bone de@@ centr@@ ation is made fast , and a new bone material is un@@ locked , which makes the bone material used as normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by Ac@@ la@@ sta by increasing the bone structure again , thereby a normal bone speci@@ alizes and thus the bones again promises .
if you are based in dental treatment , or under@@ way dental surgery must inform you your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
for application of Ac@@ la@@ sta with other drugs . please inform your doctor , pharm@@ acies or care personnel when you use other drugs to use / use / or recently taken , even if it concerns the prescri@@ ption medicine .
for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you take drugs , from which it is known that they do it .

summary of the EP@@ AR was a summary of the European public document ( EP@@ AR ) , which is analyzed in which the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) is evaluated in order to get recommendations on the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is applied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can not be used alone ( mono@@ therapy ) in case of patients ( a diabe@@ tic drug ) . • It can be used together with another diabe@@ tic drug ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( particularly important patients ) , it can &apos;t be used with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ benzene or insulin delivery , the dose must be employed at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ co@@ mia ( low blood sugar ) ; here you should be reduced the dose of Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ ma or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be improved in better and reduces blood sugar level , thereby reducing type 2 diabetes .
in more than 1 400 patients received the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; however , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ benzene in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ able hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which means that the blood sugar values are reduced from 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg respectively .
at the end of the trial in trial , the effect of an additional treatment of acet@@ ylene in combination with met@@ form@@ yl@@ benzene in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values reduced by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , the patient had been examined in addition to insulin delivery , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to placebo , in addition to placebo .
the most common side effects in relation with Ac@@ counts were visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , infections of the upper breathing ( reductions ) , weight gain and hypo@@ th@@ esia ( low sensitivity ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients suffering from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or one of the other ingredients , nor in patients with liver problems , her@@ heart failure or diabe@@ tic K@@ eto@@ x ( high level of level of aci@@ d@@ sp@@ ar - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos as part of a single agent ( at the same use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients who are not displayed in patients with met@@ form@@ in .
October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ e@@ Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited granted a approval for the placing on the market of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and wear on a page called &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is unbe@@ aten in un@@ compromising in case of contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility . ( see section 4.4 ) .
the application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ ac@@ on for patients under 18 years are not available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients who are due to the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. early heart disease or sympt@@ om@@ atic heart disease ) are endanger@@ ed , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose of continuously .
the patients should be observed at the signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve .
the patients should be observed at the signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ovens , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ ac@@ on in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing for advanced ph@@ armac@@ op@@ ric disease was performed .
in this study , an increase of reports on the form of heart failure , which however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output voltage @-@ liver enzyme ( ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the norm ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on cannot be used .
if the ALT mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the norm range , the liver enzyme are as soon as possible .
if one patient symptoms have been developed to point out to a h@@ ep@@ atic D@@ ys@@ function , such as un@@ explained nausea , vomiting , harmon@@ ics , fatigue , appetite and / or dark Har@@ n are to check the liver enzyme .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is being continued , should be led by the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ ac@@ on , a dos@@ ed weight gain has been detected , which can cut fat @-@ fat in some cases with liquid fluid .
as a result of a h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution in therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on a minor reduction in the medium hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ ac@@ on ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in around 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and in a lower degree in patients under Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ ma and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ atop@@ o@@ ede@@ s by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin level in patients , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used as or@@ ale two @-@ and @-@ times combination therapy with a Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ ate or as two @-@ in combination therapy , insulin @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ co@@ mia .
after the market launch , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , an actions or deteri@@ oration of a diabe@@ tic macular ede@@ ma , with a reduction of visual acuity .
it is unc@@ le@@ ar whether it gives a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ es to be aware of a macular ede@@ ma ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological analysis should be drawn into account .
in a summ@@ ari@@ zing analysis of mil@@ led events in a randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials , over a period of up to 3.5 years , with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ ac@@ on .
the frac@@ ture of 1.9 Fra@@ k@@ tures per 100 patient was treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tions of 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative study .
in the Pro@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years in patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated patients with 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tions of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated patients compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frames per 100 patient years ) treated with a comparative study .
the patients should be aware of a pregnancy , and if one female patient wishes to be a pregnancy , or this one , the treatment ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the inter@@ actions of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on have no relevant effects to ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ oxin , War@@ far@@ es , Phen@@ phen@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with drugs used by these enzymes , e.g. or@@ ang@@ tiv@@ a , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium @-@ channel blo@@ cker and HM@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ er inhibitor are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with mixtures ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibitor ) resulted in an increase of AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on to the 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( an cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is attributable to the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ ac@@ on which is reduced in pregnancy inter@@ ro@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin level of the mother , which reduces the availability of met@@ abolic subsi@@ dies for fö@@ ld growth .
very frequent &gt; 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( out of this data is not estim@@ ating ) .
these lead to a temporary change of the conversion and the board of the lens , as they are observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ce@@ mic effect .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , ALT An@@ sti@@ ege are many times the upper limit of the norm range , as often as placebo , however , less than in comparative groups than met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ a .
in a out@@ come study in patients with the existing advanced ph@@ armac@@ op@@ ric disease , the frequency of a severe heart failure was reduced by 1.6 % higher than placebo if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on bz@@ 2 .
since the market launch , rare beyond heart failure of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reported , however , if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reported in combination with insulin in or in patients with heart failure in the An@@ am@@ n@@ stein .
a summ@@ arized analysis of mil@@ led events in a randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials for a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with comparative group .
in the over a period of 3.5 years in the current Pro@@ active study , Fra@@ k@@ tures was treated with 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ) of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated patients compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with comparative media .
at taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day more than seven days did not occur .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on appears on a activation of specific nuclear power recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ D ) , which leads to the animal model for increased insulin @-@ sensitive of liver , fat and skel@@ eton cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on will reduce glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral blood use in case of insulin drug resistant .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ( mono@@ therapy ) was transferred over two years to investigate the therapeutic eff@@ ectivity ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) was treated by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on at 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ dal ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar have been adjusted according to three im@@ on@@ ati@@ te Optimi@@ zation phase with insulin delivery , to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ ac@@ on or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients who continued only insulin in patients ; a reduction of insulin delivery in the Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated group was observed .
in clinical studies via Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on showed consistently a statistically significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ qu@@ oti@@ ent compared to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mono@@ therapy with 45 mg versus Pla@@ z@@ ebo ) was tested for type 2 @-@ diabe@@ tic patients in a small group of 18 weeks .
in most clinical trials , placebo @-@ tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase of HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels are slightly below , but clin@@ ically advanced L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels are observed .
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ ac@@ on reduced the total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
compared with Pla@@ z@@ ebo , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was no statistically significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol in@@ mirror , while under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ dal levels were observed .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on not only reduced the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , both via an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de Ab@@ sorption as well as to the tri@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
in the Pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus have been random@@ ly assigned to existing anti @-@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular disease either with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ ac@@ on or placebo for over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after orange application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is quickly res@@ or@@ bed , and the peak concentrations in un@@ altered Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is usually achieved 2 hours after application .
based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV represents the efficacy of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on &apos;s efficacy in about three times the efficacy of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , while the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies could be proved that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ oxin , War@@ far@@ es , Phen@@ phen@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with mixtures ( cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibitor ) or ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) reduces plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radioactive substance Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ ac@@ on , markers was found mainly in the cases ( 55 % ) and to a lower degree in Har@@ p ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation period of un@@ altered Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is for people 5 @-@ 6 hours , and all the active Met@@ abol@@ ites is at 16 - 23 hours .
Plas@@ ma@@ ker@@ ations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its met@@ abolic age are significantly lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy subjects , but the data of oral Clear@@ ance is similar .
in to@@ xi@@ ological studies in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys , led to the repeated administration of plasma volumes with h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , an@@ emia , and reversible kind of heart hyper@@ b@@ a .
this is attributable to the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ ac@@ on which is reduced in the base @-@ standing hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin p@@ ine@@ ties of the mother and thus reduces the availability of met@@ abolic subsi@@ dies for fö@@ ld growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ c@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( with male rats ) of the ure@@ bred epi@@ th@@ els .
in a animal model of family om@@ at@@ ous Poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ans led to a increased incidence of collector .

the frac@@ ture of 1.9 Fra@@ k@@ tures per 100 patient was treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tions of 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative study .
in the Pro@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years in patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated patients with 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tions of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated patients compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frames per 100 patient years ) treated with a comparative study .
in another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or G@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ dal were examined .
in clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ qu@@ oti@@ ent in comparison to the output values .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on not only reduced the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved by tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both via an effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de Ab@@ sorption as well as to the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ de synthesis .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been producing Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as can produce no insulin delivery in which the body is not able to use insulin in effectively , insulin .
in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ able hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane resulted in a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c spi@@ der , that showed that blood sugar level were similar to the blood sugar level like with another human insulin .
Ac@@ ry@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied for patients who is very sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the cans of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adapted if it is administered along with a number of other drugs that can act on the blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found ) .
the CH@@ MP Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) was found that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane near the treatment of diabetes compared to the risk .

the medicine is not recommended for children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t , as it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study , on which 1 0@@ 72 patients were part , the efficacy of three Aden@@ ur@@ ic @-@ do@@ si@@ ties ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) were compared to the placebo ( head@@ count ) and of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic acid ) .
in the second study two Do@@ si@@ ties of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg per day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
main Indian indicator for effectiveness was the number of patients whose ure@@ bred Arabian was in the blood with the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 from 262 ) of patients who had a dose of 80 mg in revenues , and 65 % ( 175 from 269 ) patients who had a total of 120 mg of patients during the last three measurements of a blood of under 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 from 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and no more than 134 patients under placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash , and normal liver .
in particular , in patients with heart disease , there may also be increased risk of certain adverse events that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) was more effective as Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of adverse events related to the heart and blood vessels in connection with the heart and blood vessels .

the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain or joints ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , sti@@ pation loss ( rho@@ cer@@ a ) of the cer@@ eal , dy@@ f@@ ag@@ ie ( gor@@ ck@@ a ) , tra@@ iling ab@@ d@@ omen ( ab@@ sten@@ ed abs ) as well as aci@@ sts .
in patients with horizontal hyper@@ sensitivity ( all@@ ergy ) against Al@@ en@@ dr@@ onat , vitamin D3 or one of the other components may be applied to AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE .
in case of patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ ä@@ s , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ ä@@ mia ( low calcium @-@ level ) or in patients who are not stand for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or deposits ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vit@@ amine supplement ) for the day .
the following references are exactly to follow , in order to reduce the risk of the optic line and to reduce side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE should be swal@@ lowed out after the day of day , only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not occur before the first intake of the day , at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

eco @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al strike , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Stri@@ c@@ tures , were reported in patients under the taking of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ onat ( partially they were in @-@ time and required a hospital instruction ) .
the doctor should be aware of all the signs and symptoms who are believed to be noted in the occurrence of symptoms such as Dy@@ ri@@ ag@@ ie , pain in the gor@@ ges or retro@@ sp@@ ar pain or new or rel@@ ate to the So@@ d@@ burn medicine , to get medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe adverse events seem to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine not correctly and / or , according to the occurrence of symptoms that take place on a ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ir@@ rit@@ ation .
it is very important that all Do@@ si@@ can be passed on the patients and understood by the patients ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ onat there was no more risk of risk ( to market launch ) Mag@@ i and Du@@ ode al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , including some of them are presented and comp@@ lications ( see section 4.8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis of the Ki@@ ef@@ ers , usually reported in patients with a rel@@ ap@@ se and / or local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy contains mainly intraven@@ ously , with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available to give the evidence of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who require a c@@ alli@@ tic surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis of the Ki@@ ef@@ &apos;s .
the clinical assessment through the treating doctor is essential for the treatment planning in any patients on the basis of an individual no @-@ risk assessment .
the patients have to be said that they take the dosage of a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE who take the tablet in the next morning after they have noticed it .
you should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking the intake of one tablet a week as originally planned on the day of the week@@ day .
other diseases that affect the mineral changes ( such as vitamin D @-@ deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ di@@ tism ) , should also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE who also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ onat and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicine may be the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ dr@@ dr@@ onat when they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients have to wait for at least 30 minutes after taking away from Al@@ en@@ dr@@ onat they take other drugs ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific studies studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ onat were taken with clinical trials together with a variety of usually carried out drugs without having clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is intended only for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not allowed during pregnancy nor shut down women during pregnancy .

in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ onat in comparison to the Pla@@ z@@ ebo Group , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ onat amounted to 3.2 % ) in the percentage of patients who had suffered one or several verteb@@ rates .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the cont@@ ents of the BM@@ D of verteb@@ ral column and Tro@@ chan@@ ter continues to keep the BM@@ D of the Fem@@ ur@@ hal@@ ve and the entire body .
Fit consisted of two plac@@ ental clinical trials , where Al@@ lo@@ dr@@ onat daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily either under 1 or 2 years ) was taken over :
in this study , the daily gift of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ onat reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ rates by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ onat 7,@@ 9 % vs. Pla@@ z@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ sion@@ ing therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should not easily integrate this drug or changes in immun@@ os@@ co therapy .
due to the relevant differences of the systematic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can lead to immun@@ ity or to an increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ or over@@ immun@@ ity .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage should be carried out ; conversion of formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the lower control of a medical device ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
in a consequence of a change to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dose adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us will be retained .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based on clinical assessment of evaluation and toler@@ ability in individual cases and to blood levels ( see section below )
after switching to programming to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mud should be controlled by switching and over two weeks after switching .
one day 4 was the systemic exposure , measured as Tal@@ mud , with both form@@ ulations and kidney transplan@@ tations .
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mud , recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate effect phase .
because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is an substance with lower Clear@@ ance , it is possible to take an adjustment of Adv@@ agra@@ f @-@ Dos@@ is@@ as several days , until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
in case of patients in the first postoperative phase , no oral intake of medicine allows the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment intraven@@ ously ( Progra@@ mming 5 mg / ml concentrate on the production of a in@@ fusion solution ) .

recommended dosage : conversion of programming to Adv@@ agra@@ f must have a daily dosage of games capsules onto a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f in order to take place in a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg / mg ) , referring to the total daily dose to be carried out .
kidney cancer and liver transplan@@ tation After a change from other immun@@ os@@ si@@ va on Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment with kidney cancer and liver transplan@@ t recommended dose for proph@@ yla@@ xis in the gra@@ ft reactions .
heart transplan@@ tation in adult patients who are transported on Adv@@ agra@@ f , is an oral initi@@ ating dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day once a day once in the morning .
other transplan@@ tation , who did not have any clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in lung , pan@@ kre@@ p@@ - and response transplan@@ t patients in an oral initi@@ als dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and for intestinal transplan@@ tation in an or@@ initi@@ als dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustments in specific patients with reduced liver function , which can be used for maintaining of bl@@ utt@@ al@@ mirror in the targeted range , can be necessary in patients with severe liver ab@@ norm@@ ality of the dose .
patients with reduced kidney function : the kidney function does not affect the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it may be assumed that an dose adjustment is not required .
however , due to the neph@@ ro@@ toxic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , thorough monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ en@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in mirror , calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ inc@@ ance and monitoring of ure@@ a ) is recommended .
change from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f At the conversion of a C@@ ic@@ los@@ et shop on a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is very well suited ( see sections 4.4 + 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the valley level in the whole blood . the dose should be based on clinical assessment of removal and toler@@ ability in individual cases under random blood @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mud controls .
it is recommended for frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mud during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ king of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled according to recovery of programming to Adv@@ agra@@ f , Dos@@ is@@ adjustment , changes of immun@@ os@@ copic therapy or on the use of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f a drug with a low Clear@@ ance is , customi@@ zations of the dose must require several days , up to the Ste@@ ady State .
data in clinical trials are able to conclude that a successful treatment in most cases is possible in the blood of 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the Tal@@ ro@@ lim@@ us increase in thorou@@ gh@@ bred in the first time after liver transplan@@ tations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance of liver , kidney and cardiac transplan@@ tations were generally used in blood concentrations in the range 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has led to severe adverse events , including gra@@ ft reactions or other side effects , which can occur in a row of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us base or inter@@ exposure .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage should be carried out ; conversion of formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the lower control of a medical device ( see section 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft reactions , which are proved compared with other immun@@ os@@ si@@ va as a refrac@@ tory , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ali@@ ation formulation .
in proph@@ yla@@ xis , the gra@@ ft ment of adult transplan@@ tation and transplan@@ ts are currently no clinical data for the ret@@ ali@@ ation formulation .
due to potential inter@@ actions which can lead to a her@@ de@@ composition of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ b level ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) , or other plant sheets are included in the treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with Di@@ ar@@ rh@@ ö , there is a particularly careful supervision of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us - concentrations in the blood because the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood level can be subjected to these circumstances .
in rare cases , less than Kar@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was called aqueous hum@@ or and Sept@@ m hyper@@ b@@ hi@@ e that can therefore be seen under Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such so@@ aking disorders , an treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hypertension , kidney or liver function , infections , liquid over@@ load and oil .
as with other immun@@ os@@ si@@ va , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk or use of a solar protection , using a high protection factor .
when patients who take the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for p@@ res as head@@ aches , changed consciousness condition , herbs and visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , should have a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. B ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f hard cap@@ sul@@ ates , lact@@ ose , lact@@ ose , L@@ act@@ ose @-@ in@@ toler@@ ant , lact@@ ose deficiency or glucose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ tic particular caution is offered .
the simultaneous use of medicine or vegetable medicinal products which are known as inhibit@@ ors or induction of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , and thus reducing the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or reduce the blood pressure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
therefore , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ us can change the tac@@ it of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism , monitor and monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose for maintaining high levels of levels ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .

ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood level mainly consisting of the increased bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by the inhibit@@ ing of the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal stain@@ ing .
highly dos@@ ed Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used for acute impact reactions , the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can increase or lower in the blood .
effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other drugs Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibitor ; therefore , the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be detected using CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 met@@ ro@@ using the metabolism .

Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of blood cells in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by a deficiency of factor VIII , connected to the blood circulation ) .
the dosage and frequency of application may be applied to the treatment of blood , or to prevention of blood cells in surgery .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer by a factor VIII @-@ deficiency that causes blood @-@ related problems such as hem@@ or@@ ations in the joints , muscles , or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted of human plasma , but according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was applied to the formation of the human Ger@@ inn@@ ation factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is a different in the European Union &apos;s approved drug , is similar , but it is different , so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the medicine was examined with the prevention of blood cells and surgery .
in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate was honoured with the prevention of blood cells in 86 % of 510 new blood don@@ ors of &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are dizziness , head@@ aches , py@@ rex@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate may not be applied for patients who are sensitive to the human Ger@@ inn@@ ate factor VIII , mouse , or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or one of the other components .
March 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG granted approval for the placing on the market in the entire European Union .
dosing for the dosage and duration of sub @-@ constitu@@ tions are addressed after the heavy @-@ wheel of the factor VIII @-@ Man@@ asse@@ h , according to the place and the extent of blood and clinical condition of patients .
in the following years , the factor VIII @-@ activity should not exceed the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period under the specified plasma level ( in % of the norm or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection contains all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours for patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and the acute Be@@ aches .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) and repeat the risk for patients .
during the course of treatment , the control is administered to the control of the dose and the frequency of inj@@ ections a appropriate determination of factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ mas@@ ons .
individual patients can distinguish themselves in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vivo recovery , and different levels .
proph@@ yla@@ xis , a long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of blood in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , doses lie between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. of factor VIII per kg of body weight per kilogram of body weight .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ ids does not be achieved or if the blood flow with a reasonable dose must be carried out , a test must be carried out in order to show a inhibitor .
in patients with high inhibit@@ or@@ values , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be requested .
the administration speed should be set up after the patients , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutral antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
those inhibit@@ ors are always vulnerable to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII Immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine that are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk of inhibit@@ ors to develop , cor@@ related with the quantity of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 Ex@@ positioning days is dependent on the biggest and of genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ position@@ ist and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tic inhibitor was observed , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product to another , the re@@ occur of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare country of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences over the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and still experiences .
in the largest number of patients , inhibit@@ ors were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , who received no higher risk on the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 up to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of the available data ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of individual patient ( 234 ) calculated the unexpected increase of the blood factor VIII sp@@ ine ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
blood circulation was cut off during the whole time , and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirrors in plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed up enough values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE at 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed he@@ avier H@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and predic@@ tion exposure to 26 Ex@@ positioning days with A@@ DV@@ ATE a low inhibit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da ) .
in addition , no one of the 53 of the 53 year patients with an age of 6 was diagnosed with serious hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure of factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibitor .

based on the basis of the initial approval of the CH@@ MP , the CH@@ MP has evaluated the benefit risk assessment as a positive result , but in which the safety profile for the following reasons are closely monitored :
therefore , the CH@@ MP is based on the basis of security fil@@ tered by A@@ DV@@ ATE , which is required by P@@ SU@@ Rs all 6 months , decided to apply for further extensions in 5 years .
in December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited presented the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer .
normally , the chest , the brain , the bone , or the crossover components ( tissues , the other structures in the body , and is based on ) .
it is a kind of virus , the gen@@ esis was changed so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
in the virus in Adv@@ oc@@ in , a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; that was changed so that there is no copies of himself to solve the people .
Adv@@ oc@@ in would be inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ours and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal type 53 @-@ protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the non @-@ def@@ ective tissue in the human body , is usually produced to restore cor@@ rupt DNA and kill the cells when the DNA can &apos;t be restored .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , at which the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein does not correct , and the cancer cells can grow and divide up .
the company specified the data from a study using the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of sub@@ structure , in the bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP the responses of the company had been checked out to him , were still un@@ explained some questions .
based on the verification of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP has a list of questions concerning the company sent to the company .
according to CH@@ MP , it was not enough that the injection of Adv@@ oc@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ours brings advantages to patients .
the Committee had also carried out concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration , as well as security of the drug .
in addition , the company had not enough , that Adv@@ an in reliable way can be produced in reliable way , neither does not get the environment for people who come in contact with the patients .
the company established the CH@@ MP not of it in knowledge , whether the return consequences for people who currently under@@ taking clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
the active agent , &quot; means that the tablets should be made , that one of the effective ingredients are immediately , and the others is released over a few hours .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergic reactions ( Heu@@ w , through an all@@ ergy or inflammation ) in patients with nose @-@ sand@@ ing ( hidden nose ) .
for adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze twice daily a tablet which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as possible as possible , as soon as the symptoms occur , above all the swelling of the nose ret@@ ina ( hidden nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be found on the alignment of the nose .
the main protection dimensions were the changes of gravity of the hypo@@ cris@@ p@@ ic symptoms which were reported by the treatment of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary , and evaluated with a standard scale , as difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all the hypo@@ thesis of the nose , the patients reported that aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze reported revenue , over a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 35@@ ,@@ 9 % in patients who pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin alone revenues .
if only the swelling of the nose was considered , the patients shown in aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze showed a line of symptoms by 3@@ 7,@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients suffering from Des@@ lor@@ en@@ adin alone .
the most common adverse events of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , an@@ cho@@ red , dizziness , psych@@ omot@@ oric hyper@@ activity ( weakness ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , head@@ aches , fatigue , in@@ som@@ ites ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) , Som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( bat fri@@ ness ) , ins@@ om@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze may be sensitive to patients who are sensitive to Des@@ lor@@ en@@ adin , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin or one of the other ingredients , against sl@@ um@@ able substances or Lor@@ ate ( another medicine for the treatment of aller@@ gia ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied in patients ( increased eye pressure ) , flow rate ( increased water pressure ) , Hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( over@@ function of the thy@@ ro@@ id ) or had a h@@ ensive effect ( caused by a brain injury ) or a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic impact .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a licence for the placing on the market of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , however , is to swal@@ lowed up to swal@@ lowing down ( i.e. without it , or to break up ) .
aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to the mis@@ erable and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) for children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as soon as possible , and should not be continued after the sound of symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days to limit the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin with the time .
after decrease the swelling of the loop in the upper breathing for treatment , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as a single agent .
since A@@ in@@ a@@ ze pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin contains the medicine also con@@ tra @-@ index@@ ed in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibitor or within 2 weeks after end of such therapy .
this is due to the alpha@@ be@@ tic activity in combination with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Peri@@ o@@ emulsi@@ amine , phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ sy , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rin , Oxy@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ fer@@ olin etc . ) .
safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not tested for this patient lessons , and the data are not enough to address corresponding recommendations for dosing .
safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function , and the data are not enough to address corresponding recommendations for dosing .
the patients need to be informed that the treatment is done by a hyper@@ ton@@ ie or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhyth@@ ms , nausea or any other neuro@@ logy symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or any ampli@@ fication of the head@@ aches ) .

Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before the implementation of the mat@@ ological testing , because Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka who prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions and in its quantity .
as part of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , in which ery@@ thro@@ rom@@ ycin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were given , however , no clinical trials or changes of Plas@@ ma@@ at@@ adin was observed .
in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ oric tests have no significant differences between the suffering of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and placebo treated with placebo patients , irrespective of whether Des@@ hi@@ at@@ adin alone or alcohol was taken .
responsible for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ ate @-@ responsible enzyme was not identified , so that inter@@ actions with other drugs cannot be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in vivo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 could not be inhi@@ bits and in @-@ vitro studies show that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bits and neither a substrate still a inhibitor of P @-@ gly@@ co@@ protein .
the diss@@ atis@@ faction of the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , but did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to normal population .
since the re@@ production studies of animals can not always be transferred to people and based on the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ an properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin should not be applied in pregnancy .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied in very rare cases that can be found in very rare cases that may lead to a fun@@ eral of transportation or ability to serve the ability of machines .
the symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS Depression ( Se@@ aning , Ap@@ no@@ e , cardiovascular attention , cy@@ an@@ ose , compres@@ ses , cardiovascular disease ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , Hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ mor , Kon@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering .

a Z@@ NS stimul@@ ulation is especially likely , as well as At@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth drying , pu@@ pil size , and di@@ ec@@ ation , skin , Hyper@@ thermal and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 of human master@@ ing cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es , as well as inhibit@@ ing expression of the expression of the Ad@@ hesi@@ ve P @-@ Sel@@ tin .
for a single dose study using adult Des@@ hi@@ at@@ adin 5 mg no influence on standard measuring sizes of the flight sizes , including the ampli@@ fying subj@@ ective bats or tasks that are connected to the fittings .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily was no increased incidence of stro@@ kes compared to placebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin in the recommended dosage can be found in an impressive level of blood pressure , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ aoke or manifest@@ ations of a Z@@ NS @-@ Er@@ a .
it took 1.@@ 248 patients at the age between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic reactions , who received 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ am@@ inated efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall ranking for the sympt@@ om@@ atic ( except Nas@@ al sand@@ ing ) significantly higher than under a mono@@ therapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin for the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets as regards to the fluctu@@ ating effect , determined using the nose sand@@ ing , was significantly higher than under a mono@@ therapy with Des@@ lor@@ en@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin defined in patient groups .
as part of a single dose study to the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration .

A@@ eri@@ us has been examined in total eight studies of approximately 4 800 adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents with allergic Rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic reactions and two studies of patients who had also asth@@ ma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by elimin@@ ating the change of symptoms ( ju@@ ck@@ eting , number and size of squares , fun@@ eral for sleeping and the efficiency on the days ) and after six weeks of treatment .
there were further studies published in order to prove the body the sy@@ rup , the solution can take into the same way as the tablets as well as the tablets as well as the use of children in the same way .
the results of all studies were taken into account when the results of all studies were taken together with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us an average decrease of the symptoms ( symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received placebo .
in the two studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decline of the symptoms in six weeks after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to placebo patients treated with placebo patients .
A@@ eri@@ us cannot be applied for patients who are sensitive to Des@@ hi@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ ra@@ adin or one of the other components .
January 2001 , the European Commission signed a licence for the placing on the market of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once a day , with or without a meal , for delivery of symptoms in allergic Rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ rupt and per@@ s@@ isti@@ an allergic reactions ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical trials for effectiveness in the application of Des@@ lor@@ en@@ adin for adol@@ esc@@ ents aged 12 to 17 ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
treatment of inter@@ mit@@ ment allergic reactions ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to date of date , and can be ended after the crash of symptoms and upon their return .
the per@@ s@@ amic allergic reactions ( occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended for the treatment during allergi@@ gie@@ v .
clinical trials have been observed in clinical studies of clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets , in addition to those who were given to ery@@ thro@@ rom@@ ycin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ ph@@ armac@@ ological study , the intake of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol has not reinforced the performance effect of alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be resolved to clari@@ fied that it can be observed in very rare cases that may lead to a impair@@ ment of traffic or ability to serve the ability of machines .
clinical trials carried out in various indications , including allergic Rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ al Ur@@ tik@@ aria , reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us in patients treated with placebo .
the most frequently used side @-@ effects , over more common than in placebo was fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , bad breath ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical trial of 5@@ 78 adol@@ es@@ cent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common secondary action can be treated with 5.1 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study that reaches up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ ety @-@ time clinical dose ) , no clinical relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 of human master@@ ing cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es , as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the Ad@@ hesi@@ ve P @-@ sel@@ ess on endotheli@@ al cells .
as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses , within a dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ ph@@ armac@@ ological study , at the Des@@ hi@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( which is a time of clinical trial ) , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c intervals .
when a single dos@@ ed study using adult Des@@ hi@@ at@@ adin 5 mg did not influence the standard measuring range of the flight sizes , including the ampli@@ fying subj@@ ective bat fri@@ ness or the tasks that are connected to the fly .
in patients with allergic Rhin@@ o A@@ eri@@ us was effective at the link of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ hi@@ es and Ju@@ ck@@ eting of the nose , ju@@ ck@@ eting , lac@@ ri@@ mal and tube inc@@ entive to the pal@@ ate as well as ju@@ ck@@ eting on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic Rhin@@ o can be divided into a dependence of duration of symptoms as well as in inter@@ mit@@ ting allergic reactions and per@@ s@@ ut@@ ating allergic reactions .
inter@@ mit@@ er allergic Rhin@@ estone is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks .
per@@ s@@ amic allergic reactions will defined as occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as the result of the overall assessment of the question@@ naire on life of quality of life in the Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us was effectively caused by seasonal allergic reactions .
the chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was investigated on the other forms of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , because the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is un@@ parall@@ eled to the different forms , and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited .
since the hist@@ amine disease is expected to consider that Des@@ lor@@ en@@ adin has also been observed in other forms of inflammatory diseases in other forms of urine for chronic idi@@ opathic diseases ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective at the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the size of squares and number of squares at the end of the first dose .
like in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka near chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ al Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not work on anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka re@@ designed , from the study .
an improvement in the Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ d by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ hi@@ at@@ adin patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo patients .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and the juni@@ per , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study which was comparable to patients with the general , allergic reactions of population was comparable to 4 % of patients a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
there are no additional points for clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulation following a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5 mg ) than 14 days before .
however , the enzyme responsible for the met@@ abolic ism of distill@@ ation was not identified , so that inter@@ actions with other drugs are not excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in vivo did not have CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies show that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bits and neither a substrate still a inhibitor of P @-@ gly@@ co@@ protein .
in a single dos@@ ed study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fet@@ us ) did not reduce the availability of Des@@ hi@@ at@@ adin in a daily dose of 7.5 mg .
the study carried out by Des@@ hi@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin in a comparable degree of the exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no qualitative or quantitative differences in regards to the toxicity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ ra@@ adin in a similar degree .
based on conventional studies on security sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxicity of repeated treatment , gen@@ ot@@ oxi@@ fication and to achieve the pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ hi@@ at@@ adin no special risks for humans .

in a clinical @-@ ph@@ armac@@ ological study , the intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol does not intensi@@ fy the performance effect of alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the total reading of the adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group , similar to the placebo group .
clinical trials of adults with adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents in various indications , including allergic reactions and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ al Ur@@ al , were reported in the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and young people , at up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ ety @-@ time clinical dose ) , no clinical relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years , who came to an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy in question , received a daily Des@@ hi@@ ch dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic Rhin@@ o / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic and children are similar to adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated in adults .
as part of a clinical trial involving additional doses and adol@@ esc@@ ents in a dose of up to 20 mg daily . no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a daily dose of up to 20 mg daily .
in a clinical @-@ ph@@ armac@@ ological study of adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ time clinical trial ) of more than ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c intervals .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents no increased frequency of stro@@ kes compared to placebo .
in a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us identi@@ fies tablets in adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents in clinical trials to any impair@@ ment of the psych@@ omot@@ oric .
in clinical @-@ ph@@ armac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol does not permit to ampli@@ fication of the alcohol @-@ induced performance even to an increase in the bat .
in adult and adol@@ es@@ cent patients with allergic Rhin@@ op@@ pressed , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective at the lin@@ tion of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ hi@@ inc@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ eting of the nose , ju@@ ck@@ inc@@ entive , lac@@ ri@@ mal and tube inc@@ entive to the pal@@ ate .
as the result of the overall assessment of the question@@ naire on life of quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , decreased A@@ eri@@ us tablets effective which caused by seasonal allergic reactions .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective at the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the size of squares and number of squares at the end of the first dose .
the diss@@ em@@ ination of this characteristic met@@ is@@ om@@ ite was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic patients with a si@@ up@@ unc@@ ement of children aged 2 to 11 years with allergic Rhin@@ ol@@ y , which was restricted to metabol@@ ised .
the burden ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max is about 3 to 4 times higher with a time half @-@ time time of about 120 hours .
there are no additional points of clinical @-@ relevant drug abuse after once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5 - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents .
12 In various single dose trials showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in the recommended doses were comparable with those of adults , the Des@@ lor@@ en@@ adin @-@ Sir@@ up in a dose of 5 mg .

A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people for the protection against Gri@@ mm@@ y , which is caused by the strain of influenza ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 to the In@@ flu@@ enza @-@ A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine , which could cause a trunk of flu only before a trunk of influenza .
an Gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ an@@ emia breaks , when a new strain of Gri@@ pp@@ e@@ virus is mentioned , who can spread to human beings , because the people do not have any immun@@ ity ( no protection ) .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system contained in the vaccine contained parts of the flu virus as &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; and forms the antibodies .
this system allows the immune system later to form an contact with an Gri@@ pp@@ e@@ virus of this Stam@@ ms faster .
subsequently , the membran@@ es of the virus was then separated with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membran@@ es of the membran@@ es that the human body can be cleaned out ) , and used as a component of the vaccine .
a inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study did not have been carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine is not made in order to meet the requirements of the requirements for pre@@ pan@@ es vacc@@ ines .
if you need to participate in a clinical examination and more information on your treatment , please contact your treating doctor .

it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicine for treatment of adults and children over four years , which , with human immuno@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ lowed up the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is not available as a solution , but this may not be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , because the safety of this combination is not studied .
A@@ generic should only be confused , if the doctor should be tested , which has taken the anti@@ viral medication of the patient previously taken , and the probability was judged that the virus is based upon the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , combined with twice a day 100 mg of ra@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medication .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is due to body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV quantity in the blood and keeps it at a low level in combination with other anti@@ viral drug .
AIDS does not heal AIDS , however , the damage to the immune system , and thus also do the development of AIDS associated infections and diseases .
A@@ generic was examined in combination with other anti@@ viral medicine , but without R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were examined in two major studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , which had previously treated with pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor .
the low @-@ grade R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced product A@@ gener@@ ase was taken at 206 adults , which were formerly used by pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor , compared with other pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor .
main Indian indicator for effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or change from viral load according to treatment .
in the patients with patients who had not taken a pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor , although more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ generic decreased the viral load , but by the children who had been treated with pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor , were only very few at the treatment .
in the study with adults , which were treated with pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor , with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced product A@@ gener@@ ase the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment , as well as other pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor , it came with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the need of viral load after four weeks in patients who received their previous pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor :
the most common adverse events of A@@ generic ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , Di@@ ar@@ rh@@ ö ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , bro@@ ul@@ ance ( leaf@@ s ) , vomiting , rash , and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied in patients , the possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components are used .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied to patients , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ b ( an productive preparation for the treatment of depression ) or drugs that are just like A@@ gener@@ ase and are able to take care in high concentrations in the blood of health .
as with other drugs : HIV is diagnosed with HIV , the risk of a Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis ( suffering from bone tissue ) or an immune diseases ( symptoms of infection that causes the re@@ trac@@ tive immune system ) .
the CH@@ MP Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) achieved in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication for HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is generally taken together with the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifiers of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase were taken in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who did not have a pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor .
A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; since the time of approval from scientific reasons , only limited information .
October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Limited granted a approval for the placing on the market of renewable energy in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicine for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules to the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic Bo@@ ost@@ ation of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r are administered together with low doses of r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r should be carried out in consideration of the individual viral load pattern and the treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
if availability of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is a solution that is less than 1 % less than Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ generic capsules and a solution can not be inter@@ changeable for a milli@@ grams of milli@@ grams per milli@@ grams ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r twice daily combined with 100 mg spro@@ ckets twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicine .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules without the reinforced addition of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Bo@@ ost@@ ing ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ generic ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight per day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication up to a daily highest dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of aging in combination with low doses of r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor were not studied at children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for the application of children under 4 years , due to the fail@@ ures of data to diss@@ atis@@ faction and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function to 300 mg twice a day .
the simultaneous application should be carried out in patients with lighter or regular liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is con@@ tra @-@ index@@ ed ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicine which have a low therapeutic width and also Sub@@ strate of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ is@@ ail@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable preparations , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ b ( hypertension ) contain reducing plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r while taking on of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r do not be applied ( see section 4.5 ) .
the patients should be noted that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy are not able to help healing the HIV infection that they also still remain in the opportun@@ ist infections or other comp@@ lications of a HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with A@@ generic prevents the risk of an transfer of HIV to other by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ generic capsules also have to be used together with low doses of r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicine ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer chronic hepatitis B or C suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C , and with an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , there have increased risk of severe liver problems with potentially fatal course .
for the case of an simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the information information of this drug .
patients with pre@@ existing liver function including an chronic hepatitis C indicate an increased incidence of liver functional disorders with an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r are to be confused , unless the potential @-@ to @-@ use of the risk of systemic cor@@ ro@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression calculation ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the inter@@ rup@@ ture of the HM@@ G @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibitor and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin br@@ ushed from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended for the increased risk of aging with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin due to the increased risk of My@@ opath@@ ies ( R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen ) .
4 For a few drugs that cause severe or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and War@@ far@@ es ( under supervision of the International norm@@ alization ratio ) , methods to determine the drug concentration .
in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase is able to be effective for reduced plasma screens of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r less effective ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic exchange rates with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ sts can be changed , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions .
if meth@@ ad@@ on is set up at the same time with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored via O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ss@@ y@@ symptoms , in particular if there are low doses of r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , too .
due to the potential risk of risk of a toxicity due to the high prop@@ yl@@ ation of the A@@ generic solution , this sub@@ missions can be tra@@ cked in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to duration of 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the v@@ eins are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor , was reported over the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , Hyper@@ gly@@ co@@ mia or an ex@@ az@@ ed@@ itary of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases , their therapy are required to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia .
B. higher age , and with drugs - dependent factors such as a continuous anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated met@@ abolic diseases .
patients treated with pro@@ te@@ op@@ hil@@ s patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor , reports reports on an increase of blood cells including spontaneous cell @-@ hem@@ at@@ ome and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ b .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with heavy immun@@ ity , for the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) , the sensitivity of an anti @-@ retro@@ viral infections can develop , which leads to severe clinical symptoms or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ work ori@@ ental e@@ ti@@ ology ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol account , heavy immun@@ ity , higher Body @-@ Mass Index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis , in particular in patients with advanced HIV @-@ condition and / or long @-@ term application of a anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) reported .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrates , which may not be given at the same time with medicine , which have a low therapeutic width and also substrates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ is@@ ail@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ Sub@@ strate with a low @-@ therapeutic index with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be used together with medicine which are mainly used for CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to the increased plasma layer with serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side @-@ side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in had a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logy failure and to a resistance development .
at the attempt , the lower plasma layer of other pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor was observed in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often unwanted effects on the liver .
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ b ( hypertension ) The serum levels of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r can be decreased by the simultaneous application of plant preparations ( hypertension ) with Johann@@ is@@ k@@ b ( hypertension ) .
if a patient had already taken cur@@ b , the am@@ b@@ bies include am@@ b@@ lower levels and if possible to check the viral load and cur@@ b the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ b .
a dose adjustment for one of the medicine is not needed when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
508 % increases , for C@@ max against 30 % , when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
clinical trials were used by 600 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r twice daily and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which are used to evaluate the efficacy and diss@@ atis@@ faction of this treatment .
if Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min @-@ values of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is reached twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) are administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg spro@@ ckets .
a Do@@ si@@ tional preparation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but it is not recommended that the effectiveness and un@@ certainty of this combination is not known .
it was not a ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic trial in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination , but due to the ant@@ acid component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
for this reason , E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z is used in combination with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor was low .
the effect from Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin to other pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor and existing limited data , that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin reduces the serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
if this drug should be used at the same time , pru@@ dence , since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din was not effective because of the reduced and possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma screens .
if this medicine has been used together , the particular caution is provided ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring will be made , since an accurate predic@@ tion of the effect of combination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to treat .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ bla@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ bla@@ u@@ tin to increase 193 % and thereby increase the rise in Ri@@ bla@@ u@@ tin @-@ side effects .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ bla@@ u@@ tin is required with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction of the dosage of Ri@@ bei@@ u@@ tin will be at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available .
ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ generic in combination with ery@@ thro@@ rom@@ ycin were not performed , but the plasma layer of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of up to 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was a daily basis with 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol a day , compared to 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other drugs that are listed below , among them Sub@@ strate , shirts or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied to inter@@ actions with A@@ generic ; may be applied to inter@@ actions .
the patients therefore should be associated with toxic reactions , which are combined with these medicines , if they are applied in combination with A@@ generic .
based on the data of other pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor , it is advis@@ able to use Ant@@ azi@@ da not at the same time as A@@ es@@ ase , as it can cause it to res@@ or@@ able disorders .
the simultaneous use of anti @-@ vul@@ si@@ va , which are known as enzymes effect ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r can lead to a lower attachment of the plasma seal of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
the serum concentrations of calcium @-@ channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , tom@@ ti@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ odi@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ ami@@ l you can increase 10 by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which may be increased activity and toxicity of this drug .
the simultaneous intake of A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase the plas@@ ma@@ ker@@ ings in combination with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection @-@ side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ omy , visual dys@@ function and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , at R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ ul@@ as@@ et ( 4 times daily ) , while the endo@@ genous Cor@@ ti@@ sol was significantly reduced by about 86 % ( 90 % counter@@ point interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , unless the potential @-@ to @-@ use of the risk of systemic cor@@ ro@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
with HM@@ G @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibitor , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , the harden@@ ing of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are distinctive , and distinctive sc@@ ents of plasma displays during the administration of A@@ generic .
since plasma melt increases of this HM@@ G @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibitor of my@@ opathy including a R@@ hab@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this drug with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
it is recommended that frequency monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabil@@ isation of mirror is recommended as the Plas@@ ma@@ ker@@ ations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ ycin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the treatment of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with oral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while the use of A@@ gener@@ ase are offered with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor show a possible increase in plasma displays from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to play the 3- to 4 @-@ f@@ ache .
when Meth@@ ad@@ on , along with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored via O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ss@@ y@@ symptoms , in particular if there are low doses of r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , too .
because of its small reliability of historical tasting currently no Recommen@@ dation are given , such as Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is aimed at the same time when Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time using meth@@ ad@@ on .
in case of warning in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reinforced control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alization ratio ) is recommended due to the possibility of feeding or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ pro@@ tiv@@ a is not expected , therefore alternative methods are recommended to receive a recep@@ tion@@ .
a careful supervision of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ min and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this drug may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful supervision of the possible points for the mother , in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk lak@@ esi@@ de rats were proved by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r related substances , but it is not known that Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is going on people in the milk &apos;s milk .
a re@@ production study on impair@@ ment rats , which was administered by the cre@@ st time of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r until the end of the still time of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in the 12 body weight when low weight .
the further development of the descendants including Fer@@ til@@ ity and post@@ production was not affected by the administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r to the wom@@ b .
the fraction of A@@ gener@@ ase has been examined in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicine .
most of the A@@ gener@@ ase Treat@@ ment effects were mild to moderate side effects were very early and performed in rare for treatment .
for many of these events is not clari@@ fy if they are in connection with the intake of A@@ generic , or another at the same time , for HIV @-@ handling drugs , or if they are a result of the Gr@@ under@@ condition .
most of the below side effects stem from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor was not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg A@@ generic twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) that were treated by the test bodies as well as in connection with the study medication and in more than 1 % of patients ( Grade 3 to 4 ) were listed as well under the treatment of laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .

based on gen@@ ot@@ yp@@ ical interpre@@ tations systems , the assessment of the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be applied in patients with pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ algorith@@ m for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is defined in connection with an increased phenom@@ enal resistance to Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of a vi@@ ro@@ logy response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or Mut@@ ation@@ sm@@ u@@ ster can be subject to additional data by additional data , and it is recommended to specify the current interpre@@ tations systems for analysis of resistance testing .
based on ph@@ armac@@ ot@@ yp@@ ical interpre@@ ter systems in connection with the gen@@ ot@@ yp@@ ical data of the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies , the diagnostic resistance tests , have clinical @-@ ph@@ ot@@ yp@@ ical Cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ations ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied to the interpretation of a resistance testing .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r associated with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r associated with a certain resistant resistant against r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which remains sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , clo@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistant between Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and other pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor for all 4 fossi@@ ls of resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of some twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral load ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 Isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ š@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
vice vers@@ ari@@ zing on his activity against some other pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor @-@ resistant isol@@ ate , with the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations into the isol@@ ates .
early release of a long @-@ term treatment is recommended to keep the following treatment of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders which can influence on the subsequent treatment .
the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ a &apos;s efficacy in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily ) together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100@@ mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ clear osi@@ tive ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) using a PI , mainly with low@@ do@@ cking rings . &quot;
one hundred and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ generic , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I have been included in the part study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis introduced non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in plasma welding ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) compared to 16 weeks in order to be a non @-@ fold disease shaft of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bo@@ unding A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ generic solution was made daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
the majority of the PI was given at the same time ; the majority of the PI @-@ treated patients had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) together with A@@ gener@@ ase N@@ R@@ TI@@ s together with A@@ generic .
after 48 weeks , about 25 % of patients received a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number from 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) versus the output value .
in the process optimisation , 19 Basi@@ cs on this data should be drawn to the expected children of &quot; un@@ bo@@ iling &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase &quot; in the process optimisation .
according to oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r amounts to about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increases , for C@@ max against 30 % , when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) are administered together with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decline of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State State ( C@@ min , ss ) was influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous intake of the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be found on a large distribution volume as well as an in@@ comparable pen@@ et@@ ration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
this change leads to a decrease in the concentration of drug in plasma , whereby the amount of in@@ comparable am@@ b@@ lown , which represents the active percentage , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of in@@ comparable Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is constant at constant level , the percentage of the percentage of active substances in the ste@@ ady concentration in the Ste@@ ady State Court over the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min .
therefore , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 cells or inhi@@ bits should be administered and a sub@@ stra@@ t of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , which are given with caution if they are given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ generic capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ b@@ lown exposure like in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is made up of 14 % less bio@@ available as from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ a solution are not inter@@ changeable for a milli@@ gramm@@ ar school inter@@ changeable .
also , ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a kidney function should be low on Eli@@ mination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ atics lead to Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r plasma layer comparable to any dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
in long term studies with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats were found in male animals with male animals in mice the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) of the exposure of people , according to twice daily treatment of 1200 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ o@@ carcinoma and Kar@@ zin@@ ome was not resolved and the relev@@ ance of this observed effects is unc@@ le@@ ar .
this report data from the present expert data on people , both from clinical studies as well as the therapeutic application , but yiel@@ ded little indications for the adoption of a clinical relev@@ ance of this command .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ ys and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ oxi@@ dation tests , the bacter@@ ium @-@ lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ core test in rats and chromosome tests were included in human peripheral lympho@@ cytes were Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ oxin .
these liver cells can be monitored in clinical everyday life through measurement of AST , ALT and the activity of the alkaline phosphor@@ ous phosph@@ ates .
so far , in clinical trials , no significant liver cells in patients were observed , neither during the administration of A@@ generic nor after end of treatment .
studies on the toxicity of young , who were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality rate in control with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , treated a high mortality .
in a systematic Plas@@ ma@@ iden who was significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including th@@ ym@@ us@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ eton changes were observed , which might point out to a delayed development .
24 : if you are applied , without the reinforced addition of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Bo@@ ost@@ ing ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ generic ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight per day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication up to a daily highest dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be carried out in patients with weak or mild liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is con@@ tra @-@ index@@ ed ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For a few drugs that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and War@@ far@@ es ( under supervision of the International norm@@ alization ratio ) , methods to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to duration 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cu@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
a higher risk for a Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drugs - dependent factors such as a continuous anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated with associated disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in had a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logy failure and to a resistance development .
508 % increases , for C@@ max against 30 % , when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min @-@ values of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is reached twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) are administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg spro@@ ckets .
a Do@@ si@@ tional preparation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but it is not recommended that the effectiveness and un@@ certainty of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor was low .
if this medicine has been used together , the particular caution is provided ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring will be made , since an accurate predic@@ tion of the effect of combination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to treat .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ bla@@ u@@ tin is required with A@@ gener@@ ase , to a reduction of the dosage of Ri@@ bei@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available .
the serum concentrations of calcium @-@ channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , tom@@ ti@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ odi@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ ami@@ l can be increased by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which may be increased activity and toxicity of this drug .
in a clinical study , at R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ ul@@ as@@ et ( 4 times daily ) , while the endo@@ genous Cor@@ ti@@ sol was significantly reduced by about 86 % ( 90 % counter@@ point interval 82 to 89 % ) .
in case of warning in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reinforced control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alization ratio ) is recommended due to the possibility of feeding or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,0@@ 35 mg Eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of No@@ re@@ th@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r by 22 % regarding .
this drug may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful supervision of the possible points for the mother , in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a re@@ production study on impair@@ ment rats , which was administered by the cre@@ ases in U@@ ter@@ us by the end of the time of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in the body weight by the end time .
the fraction of A@@ gener@@ ase has been examined in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicine .
in case of an over@@ act , the patient is observed at the signs of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in vitro on HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both at ak@@ ut and chronic infected lympho@@ cy@@ tic cells ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lympho@@ cytes .
the 50 % shirt concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is between 0,0@@ 12 and 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M in infected infected cells and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
vice vers@@ ari@@ zing on his activity against some other pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor @-@ resistant isol@@ ate , with the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations into the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , the treatment optimization was observed with PI pre @-@ treated children of &quot; un@@ bo@@ iling &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase &quot; in the process optimisation .
while the absolute concentration of in@@ comparable Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is constant at constant level , the percentage of the percentage of active substances in the ste@@ ady concentration in the Ste@@ ady state concentration in the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 cells or inhi@@ bits should be administered and a sub@@ stra@@ t of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , which are given with caution if they are given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also , ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a kidney function should be low on Eli@@ mination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long term studies with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats were found in male animals with male animals in mice the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) of the exposure to people twice daily treatment of 1200 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ zel@@ ular mes@@ ome and Kar@@ zin@@ ome was not resolved and the relev@@ ance of this observed effects is unc@@ le@@ ar .
this report data from the present expert data on people , both from clinical studies as well as the therapeutic application , however little indications for adoption of a clinical relev@@ ance of this command .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ ys and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ oxi@@ dation tests , the anti @-@ lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ core test in rats and chromosomes of human lympho@@ cytes were included in human peripheral lympho@@ cytes were not mut@@ ed nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on the toxicity of young , who were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality rate in control with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , treated a high mortality .
these results can conclude that in young , the metabolism of metabolism are still not fully available , so Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of formulation ( z ) .
A@@ generic solution is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drug for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , pro@@ te@@ ase inhibitor ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
the benefits of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; curved f@@ ake &quot; A@@ gener@@ a solution was not included in the PI @-@ treated patients with PI @-@ treated patients .
if availability of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is a solution that is less than 1 % less than Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ generic capsules and a solution can not be inter@@ changeable for a milli@@ grams of milli@@ grams per milli@@ grams ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the patients should be able to swal@@ lows the capsules to swal@@ lowed up the capsules ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic solution amounts to 17 mg / kg body weight per day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication up to a daily dose of 2800 mg of am@@ b@@ lown , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since no dose recommendation for the simultaneous application of A@@ generic solution can be set up and low do@@ cking R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r may be avoided , this combination will be avoided in these patients .
although a dose adjustment for Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for use , is an application of A@@ generic solution to take with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of an toxic reaction as a result of the high Prop@@ ylene Oxi@@ y@@ col@@ an in a result of small children and children under 4 years , at pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration can lead to a com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tive inhibit@@ ing of this drug and possibly lead a severe and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects like the heart rhyth@@ ms ( z .
the patients should be noted that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy doesn &apos;t include the virus of HIV / virus or other comp@@ lications of a HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with A@@ generic prevents the risk of 47 of an transfer of HIV to other by sexual contact or contamination with blood .

your doctor will normally need to strengthen A@@ generic capsules together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , to strengthen the effect of A@@ generic .
the use of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on your doctor from your doctor for you with the resistance of resistance and your treatment history .
keep your doctor if you suffer from one of the above @-@ mentioned drugs or from any of the above drugs .
if your doctor recommended that you take A@@ es@@ ase capsules together with low doses of r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r to ampli@@ fication the effect ( Bo@@ ost@@ ation ) , make sure that you have read the use of the treatment formation to R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
similarly , no proper information can be found in order to recommend the application of A@@ generic capsules together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , with children aged 4 to 12 years or generally recommended for patients under 50 kg of body weight .
therefore it is important that you can read the section &quot; For taking of A@@ gener@@ ase with other drugs , &quot; before you begin with taking the taking of A@@ generic .
for example , you need to control additional factor VIII to control the blood rate . − By patients who received an anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy , a re@@ distribution , collection , or a loss of body fat .
if you have certain drugs that lead to severe side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ am@@ ycin , cy@@ am@@ ycin , cy@@ am@@ ycin , cy@@ am@@ ycin , cy@@ am@@ ycin , and War@@ far@@ es , for the same time as A@@ generic , your doctor may perform additional blood tests , to minimize potential security issues .
it is recommended that HIV @-@ positive women are to use their children under no circumstances to avoid the transmission of HIV .
transportation and use of machines There have no studies on the influence of A@@ gener@@ ase on the driver or ability to serve the ability of machines .
please note this drug only after consultation with your doctor if you are familiar with your doctor if you suffer from an accident prevention against certain assign@@ ments .

however , the applic@@ atory th@@ reading and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on a maximum of 16 weeks a week . • In the case of a case for a period of two weeks , It is during one or two weeks of treatment cycles , with four weeks break between the treatment cycles , three times a week .
the cream is in front of the sleeping bags on the affected skin areas , so that they are sufficient for a long time ( approximately eight hours ) on the skin before they will be washed .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was tested with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four major studies in 9@@ 23 patients with War@@ zen in the genital area each 16 weeks .
the main reasons for effectiveness was the number of patients with complete dis@@ appoint@@ ments . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied at 7@@ 24 patients with small bases of cancer in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks , respectively , Al@@ dar@@ a or the placebo given either every day or five times a week .
main Indian indicator for the effectiveness was the number of patients with full effect of tum@@ ours according to twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 505 patients with acute ceramics .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • The results of both studies on bas@@ al cell cancer resulted in a complete response rate of 66 % to 80 % with Al@@ dar@@ a treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common adverse events of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the field of use of the cream ( pain or ju@@ ck@@ eting ) .

in other studies where no daily pre@@ h@@ am@@ y@@ gi@@ ene has been carried out , two cases of he@@ avier and one case with one for circum@@ c@@ inc@@ ture were observed .
when using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there was an increased risk of poor skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) in rare cases were observed in an effective application of major local skin irrit@@ ability , which have made treatment required and / or to a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where these reactions were at the output of the ure@@ a tube , some women difficulties had difficulties to make a emergency number and treatment of the affected area .
for application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream directly in connection with other cut@@ aneous treatment for the treatment of external f@@ ing@@ i@@ od in the genital and periods of clinical experiences there are no clinical experiences .
limited data indicate an increased rate of fittings , with HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has demonstrated a lower effectiveness in this patient group in relation to the disposal of the case .
treatment of the bas@@ al cell cancer with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eye , the nose , lips or the hair loss was not studied .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions takes place in general during therapy or reactions . after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if it is necessary due to the condition of the local skin reactions , a treatment of treatment can be made from several days .
the clinical result of the therapy can be evaluated after the rainfall in the treated skin for about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment are available , should be drawn to super@@ fied bas@@ al cell cancer and other suitable treatments .
in patients with recur@@ rent @-@ treated and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs are no clinical experiences . therefore the application was not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours .
data from an open clinical trial show that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 cm2 ) considered a lower probability of contact with the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ker@@ at@@ rophy on eye levels , inside the nose or ears or ears in the d@@ oll field .
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of an@@ ato@@ sis at an@@ ato@@ ical positions outside the faces and the scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis on sub@@ poor and hands support the effectiveness in this application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions are usually back in the course of intensity or go back to the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if the local skin reactions may cause large Un@@ beh@@ est or very strong , the treatment can be exposed to some days .
from the data of an open clinical study revealed that patients with more than 8 active lesions are reduced by a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions .
due to the immune @-@ stimul@@ ating properties of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream with caution is applied in patients who received an immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
there are no direct or indirect effects of animal studies on the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fö@@ ld development , the binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .

in clinical trials evaluating I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment of treatment or in the surrounding area .
the main one @-@ off image of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 @-@ bag to nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically counter@@ parts which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ onia that stimul@@ ated according to oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in a ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , the systematic concentrations of the alpha@@ be@@ tic and other cy@@ tok@@ ine were detected following the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete allocation of the case was significantly stronger at an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ in@@ od treatment for 16 weeks of a placebo treatment .
at 60 % of the patients were healed with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , who had healed the case in patients ; this was 20 % of the 105 with placebo @-@ induced people in patients ( 95 % CI )
a full allocation could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % from 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was investigated for five weeks in five double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed by single primary super@@ nat@@ al bas@@ al cell carcinoma with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .

the approved indicator of the external f@@ ing@@ es , ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis and Super@@ inten@@ tional bas@@ al cell carcinoma should not be studied at pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not studied .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was investigated in four randomised , double @-@ blind controlled studies at the age of 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum Haupt@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was unable to be shown in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks .
a minimum system of 5 % of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ i@@ odine @-@ cream due to the skin of 58 patients with acute ceramics was observed during the three weekly application during 16 weeks .
serum and concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and 1.6 ng / ml of application in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 single bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and in the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ time period was about 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ time time according to the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study ; this indicates an extended retri@@ eval of the drug in the skin .
the data on the systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low in the age of 6 @-@ 12 years in age and comparable with healthy adults and adults with acute ceramics or super @-@ high bas@@ al cell carcinoma .
in a four @-@ month study , in a medium @-@ month study of 0.5 - 2.5 mg / kg kg , a significantly reduced weight of weight and increased Mil@@ z @-@ weight ; for a four months , the study showed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year @-@ old study to the car@@ dinal administration in mice he induced non@@ tum@@ ours in three days a week without tum@@ ours .
the corresponding mechanism is not known but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od is only a small systematic absorption of human skin and not mut@@ agen , is a risk for people due to the systematic exposure to be very low .
the tum@@ ours in the group of mice was treated with the acting free cream , formerly used and in larger number as in the control group with lower U@@ VR .

in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was investigated , however , its effectiveness was measured in terms of reduction of G@@ AG concentration in urine and in terms of the size of the liver .
with children under five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was the G@@ AG concentration in Ur@@ qui@@ um around 60 % , and half of the treated children reported a normal liver on the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me have been observed in the age of over five years ( one of 10 patients ) , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , pain in the body ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ sensation , fever and reactions .
very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen saturation ( a measured size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ at ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and Schüt@@ tel@@ a .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be sensitive to lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase ( allergic ) to Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic response ) , not to be applied .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) is required every year all the new information that may be published and update this summary required .
the producer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is received for patients who observe Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as regards the reactions to In@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
June 2003 , the European Commission granted G@@ uten@@ az@@ y@@ me Company granted approval for the placing on the market of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me into the entire European Union .
Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is a combin@@ ant form of human vision -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase and is produced using a combined DNA technology under the use of Ch@@ o @-@ Mamm@@ tier cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ stock of the Chinese H@@ AM@@ ST@@ ERS ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is for long @-@ term enzymes in patients with the diagnosis of a Mu@@ er@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ des I ( MP@@ S I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logy of disease infection ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other met@@ abolic disease .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be used if the patient carries it all 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years was not determined , and for those patients can not be recommended for this patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney disease or liver in@@ suffici@@ en@@ sic efficiency has not been determined , and for those patients can not be recommended for this patients .
with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma treatment , patients can develop in@@ fusion reactions , defined as each in connection , which during in@@ fusion or by the end of the in@@ fusion chamber appearance ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason these patients should also be monitored cutting , and the fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment where the re@@ fusion of medical devices are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , nearly all patients Ig@@ G antibodies directed against Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase , usually within 3 months of treatment .
patients receiving antibodies or symptoms of a in@@ fusion reaction , must be addressed in use of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience regarding the re@@ su@@ mption of the treatment after a longer period of inter@@ ruption , however , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of risk reaction after a inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medic@@ ations ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti @-@ tri@@ ck ) , to minimize the potential actions un@@ related reactions .
in case of a light or medium @-@ heavy reaction @-@ related response , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weighed and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate .
in case of a single , heavy in@@ fusion reaction , the in@@ fusion work must be hal@@ ted , until the symptoms were brought to decline , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen .
the in@@ fusion can be achieved with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate when the reaction has been re@@ sum@@ ed .
the response rate ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction rate of in@@ fusion rate is 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of an inter@@ rupt with the intraocular intake of lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase .
animal studies can not be found on direct or indirect effects of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
there is no data to New n@@ atives who were exp@@ ir@@ oned with Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended to use during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
clinical trials carried out mainly as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed at 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) were observed .
the patients with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , who were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension of a total of 45 patients have been observed in the following table : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe MP@@ S @-@ I , the participation in the upper breathing and lungs in the history also severe reactions were related to , including bron@@ chi@@ osp@@ asmus , breathing and visual acuity ( see section 4.4 ) .
children of adverse impacts in relation to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , who were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , were reported with heavy duty @-@ form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , it was within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , where in the age of 5 patients usually come to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version ( average after 26 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
by the end of the phase 3 study ( or until an early departure from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were not det@@ ectable by Radio@@ immuno@@ assay ( R@@ IP ) ass@@ ay , which was never come to ser@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors .
patients with ab@@ low up to low power levels had a robust reduction of G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n , while in patients with high antibodies had a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal to low neutral operating effect on enzyme Lar@@ oni@@ zation activity in vitro which did not affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies did not appear in connection with the incidence of unwanted Medic@@ ation activities , even if the occurrence of unwanted Food and antibodies are typically kept together with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the accus@@ ation for the enzyme therapy lies in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the acute Sub@@ strate Sub@@ strate and the determination of a further accumulation in recovery of enzymes .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation system and cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , the most prob@@ able via Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosphor@@ us recept@@ ors .
safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were randomized in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study at the age of 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited to recru@@ itment the entire spectrum of sick@@ ness , the majority of patients were found in the middle phen@@ otype , and only one patient showed the heavy phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited when they had a strong exp@@ ir@@ ation volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to walk 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where she received more than 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patient had treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , compared to the placebo group , improving the lung function and the assist@@ ants which is shown in the following table .
in the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintain this effects of up to 208 weeks in der@@ Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and a placebo group of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group .
the decline of the expected value of the value , is no significant and the absolute lung @-@ volumes increased to be proportional to the body @-@ growing children .
of the 26 patients with a Hep@@ ato@@ mical before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) by the end of the study a normal liver .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear waste of G@@ AG mirror was found in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) which remained constant at the end of the study .
in case of a hetero@@ genous point of sick@@ ness such a combined final results , FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk , there was no change in patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a worsen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
the two @-@ year @-@ old Phase 2 study carried out in which mainly the safety and ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was studied at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with heavy @-@ shape design and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up ) .
in four patients , the dosage was increased due to an increased G@@ AG@@ - mirrors in the last 26 weeks in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients a size ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was found after the Z @-@ Sc@@ ore ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ of @-@ form @-@ form , while in the older patients with heavy @-@ form , only limited , or even no progress were found in the co@@ gni@@ tive development .
in a phase 4 study , investigations into phar@@ ma@@ ko@@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me do@@ cking schem@@ atics based on G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute period were performed .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the do@@ cking scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks in patients who have trouble with weekly in@@ fusion . however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two do@@ cking schem@@ atics is equal .

A@@ lim@@ ta will not be used together with Cis@@ pl@@ atin ( other drugs alone ) and who is not part of other parts of the body ( such as cancer ) . • more advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small cell lung cancer could not be mat@@ ured for the squ@@ amous cell lung cancer .
A@@ lim@@ ta is not treated with patients who were not covered in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who had previously received other anth@@ ra@@ ins as many therapy .
in order to reduce side effects , the patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( vitamin B12 ) and inj@@ ections of vitamin B12 .
when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with Cis@@ pl@@ atin , or after the treatment of Cis@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; Anti@@ eme@@ tic &quot; ( drugs against vomiting ) and liquids ( in order to prevent fluid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood is changed , or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be reduced , or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of p@@ emet@@ ry evap@@ oration is therefore prevented the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells divide .
the conversion of P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed in its active form is lighter than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug using a longer period of effect in cancer cells .
in a major study of 456 patients , A@@ lim@@ ta was investigated in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for their disease .
the effects of non @-@ small cell lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were treated in a study to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which had previously treated with chemotherapy compared with effects of doc@@ etaxel ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another medicine against cancer ) compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ platine , survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9,@@ 3 months at the same administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival was treated with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared with 7.1 months in doc@@ etaxel .
in both studies , however , patients were not affected with the cancer cells of cancer , during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival times in than with the comparative medicine .
September 2004 , the European Commission signed the Company El@@ i Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. a approval for the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each flow rate must be reduced with 4,2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - SIS is taken from the flow rate and can be dil@@ uted with a 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml more dil@@ uted ( see Section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for vast epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mono@@ therapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcinoma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface area ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of p@@ emet@@ ry and in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment .
reduction of skin reactions and sever@@ ity of skin reactions must be given on the day before and on the day of P@@ emet@@ ry on the day and on the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed must be taken at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid and intake must be continued during the entire therapy camp as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ ry dose .
patients also need a intra@@ mus@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in one week before the first P@@ emet@@ ry dose and after each third berries .
in patients who received P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed , before any gift was created a complete bleeding image , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ se .
the alkaline phosphor@@ us ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ing trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( ALT or S@@ G@@ PT ) should amount to &lt; 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose inspection of the blood pressure or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity of the forec@@ los@@ ure therapy cycles
after recovery , the patients have to be treated according to the references in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applied for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a single agent or in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 blood flow .
patients not develop non @-@ hem@@ ological toxicity ≥ degree 3 ( excluding neuro@@ retinal nerve ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA , until the patient &apos;s value before the treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be broken if in patients after 2 dose induc@@ tive or non @-@ hem@@ ological toxicity or 4 or 4 occurs or so@@ oner if the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neuro@@ retinal sensitivity .
clinical trials did not note that in patients with aged 65 , or higher , compared to patients aged 65 , it was increased by means of an increased secondary effective risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for the application of children under 18 years due to sufficient data for diss@@ em@@ ination and efficacy .
clinical trials were necessary in clinical trials with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , no dose adap@@ tations which goes beyond all patients recommended Dos@@ is@@ ations .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with an liver function limitation of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper side value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; to 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( with presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied in studies .
patients have to be administered in terms of bone transplan@@ tation and P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed must not be administered in patients with a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - number again achieved a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
an dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ es , Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ant and maximum non @-@ hem@@ atology toxicity as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxicity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 of hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ chth@@ ys toxicity as neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with a degree of 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia after a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 .
therefore , all patients were treated with p@@ emet@@ ry treated patients ( fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 ) and vitamin B12 , and vitamin B12 ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney disease ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ den@@ ka ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ ry ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who were intended for therapy with P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed therapy , taking the intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ day time for at least 5 days prior to therapy on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ ry ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients , in which these events were found , corresponding risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including Deh@@ y@@ dr@@ at@@ ation , pre@@ existing hypertension or diabetes .
hence , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid - collection in trans@@ forming room a dra@@ ining of the ergonomics in front of the P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed treatment .
a severe cardiovascular events , including M@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ in , including M@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ stick , and cr@@ ashes were reported in clinical trials with p@@ emet@@ ry @-@ occasionally when this substance was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ de@@ activation lives ( except yellow @-@ e@@ ber , which is im@@ pregn@@ ated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
because the possibility of a very serious ir@@ reversible effects of re@@ productive capability should be noted in front of treatment by p@@ emet@@ ry at the days of treatment , advice on sper@@ ma@@ ids .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses can lead to a reduced pu@@ ff sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) to a reduced P@@ emet@@ ry loss ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) .
therefore it is very good enough for patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or Ac@@ et@@ yl sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid is avoided in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ ry ( see section 4.4 ) .
there is no data regarding the interaction potential as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ di@@ cap , the simultaneous application must be avoided with p@@ emet@@ ers for at least 5 days prior to therapy , at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ - x@@ ed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the calculation status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant and ant@@ ine@@ op@@ las@@ tic chemotherapy significantly requires the decision to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant .
there are no data for the use of P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed at fluctu@@ ations , but as with an@@ gen@@ rene An@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites are expected to start the pregnancy of birth def@@ ective .
p@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed must not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessarily and after careful supervision of the user for the mother and risk of risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
because the possibility of a very serious ir@@ reversible damage caused by P@@ emet@@ ry &apos;s disease should be noted in front of the treatment of treatment , advice regarding the sper@@ ma@@ con@@ vi@@ ties .
it is not known that P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed in the breast milk passes and undes@@ i@@ rable effects can not be excluded .

it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ating measures to meet the potential of severe diabe@@ tic counter@@ insur@@ gency ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study to inter@@ actions of medicine and in several cases associated with the use of or@@ li@@ stat and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed .
in use of War@@ coloured in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation in combination with or@@ li@@ stat , the Quick values ( internationally norm@@ alized ratio , IN@@ R ) may be affected ( see section 4.8 ) .
in most patients who were treated in clinical trials of up to 4 full years with or@@ li@@ stat , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta @-@ Car@@ ot@@ ins .
however , the patients should be recommended to make a supplement of the mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure a sufficient material ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the treatment of a single dose Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on , a limited number of volunteers were observed at the same time , at the same time , a minor decline of Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration .
animal studies show no direct or indirect effects of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
side effects of or@@ li@@ stat are mainly caused by gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and depend on the ph@@ armac@@ ological effect of the drug , because the absorption of or@@ li@@ stat is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with Or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg to 2 years and temporarily slightly in general and temporarily .
they are defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , no known ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of the available data ) .
the frequency of adverse events which were found after the market launch of Or@@ li@@ stat , is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain size .
it is pl@@ au@@ si@@ bel that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to gar@@ ment in terms of possible or real gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side @-@ side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ li@@ stat and multi@@ plex doses of up to 400 mg three times daily was administered over a period of 15 days without a significant clinical findings .
at majority of cases reported cases reported cases of or@@ li@@ stat transition , any side @-@ side effects or similar effects were reported in the recommended dose of Or@@ li@@ stat .
based on investigations on human and animal , it can be caused by a quick return level of systematic effects that are due to the li@@ pas@@ eh@@ ns properties of Or@@ li@@ stat .

two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled studies of adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 illustrate the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ li@@ stat , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ thesis , fatty acids .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the output value ( point of boundary ) , as follows : as a result of the body weight in study ( table 1 ) and as a percentage of those who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of its output weight ( table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight loss was observed over 12 months , the largest weight loss was reported in the first six months .
the average changes in the Gesamt@@ chol@@ est@@ erin amounted to 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .

Alo@@ xi is applied to the chemo@@ therapies for nausea and vomiting ( such as Cis@@ platine ) , as well as the chemo@@ therapies for nausea and vomiting ( such as Cy@@ clo@@ phosp@@ ha@@ mi@@ de , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be used by an additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ et ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ trust authorities ) .
the application for patients under 18 years is not recommended as compared to the effects in this age group not enough information .
this means that the active ingredient of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as Ser@@ ot@@ onin are known ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine .
Alo@@ xi was investigated in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults , the chemo@@ therapies received the chemo@@ therapies for nausea and vomiting .
the chemo@@ therapies for nausea and vomiting , showed a 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vomiting ( 132 out of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron treated patients ( 126 from 221 ) .
the chemo@@ therapies for nausea and vomiting are treated to 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vomiting ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron treated patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
in case of dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values are 63 % for al@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted the City of Helsinki / Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. concluded a approval for the placing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi was index@@ ed on the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting for heavily em@@ ented chemotherapy due to a cancer condition and vomiting for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate therapy .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi on the prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a strong em@@ ented chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ ity in front of the chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ onic fil@@ en@@ age , patients with an@@ am@@ nesty Ob@@ server or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us according to the injection unit .
however , with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agonists , the particular caution is offered with the treatment of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T @-@ interval or in patients with the Q@@ T@@ - interval , or to such an extension .
except in connection with a further chemotherapy regim@@ ens , Alo@@ xi was not to be used for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy alone .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron chemo@@ therapies for tum@@ ours ( Cis@@ platine , cyclo@@ phosp@@ ha@@ mi@@ de , Cy@@ tar@@ abine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ ycin C ) .
in a clinical trial no significant ph@@ armac@@ os@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady Cap@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population based on a population based on a population of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on , C@@ elec@@ an@@ ine , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ din , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ din , R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ ine and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ia ) , had no significant impact on Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience to the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron at human gest@@ ers are not , therefore , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied , unless it is necessary for the treating doctor than necessary .
clinical trials were the most common in clinical trials with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( altogether 6@@ 33 patients ) , at least possibly associated with Alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ achs ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity and reactions to the administration site ( burning , harden@@ ing , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ market@@ ing- experience .
in the group with the highest dosage showed similar rates of unwanted events such as in other do@@ cking groups ; there were no dose @-@ effective relations .
however , no di@@ aly@@ sis have been carried out , due to the large distribution volume , an di@@ aly@@ sis is not yet effective therapy at a Alo@@ xi@@ vec method .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1.@@ 132 mg / m2 of do@@ x@@ or@@ ic@@ in and 250 m@@ g. / m2 cy@@ c@@ or@@ ic@@ ron ( half @-@ time is 4 hours ) or 100 mg of dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.@@ 3 hours ) that was given to Day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ ason intraven@@ ously .
in a randomised double @-@ blind study , 667 patient were treated with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosp@@ ha@@ mi@@ de , and 250 or 750 micro@@ gram Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received with patients compared to 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ u@@ ron received 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ ented chemotherapy are combined in the following tables .
clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were similar to blood pressure , heart rate and E@@ KG parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to blocking the vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation of the I@@ ion channels to extend and extend the duration of the action potential .
the objective of the E@@ KG effects of 221 healthy volunteers were the evaluation of E@@ KG effects of 0.@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption by intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease of Plas@@ ma@@ ker@@ ings a slow elim@@ ination of the body with an average time half of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the &apos; s @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are propor@@ tion@@ ately proportional in general in the total dose of 0,@@ 3- 90 @-@ g / kg .
after intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses were measured at 11 tes@@ ticle cancer patients between day 1 and day 5 ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ apple simul@@ ations that once daily was comparable to an intraven@@ ous edition of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) compared to a single intraven@@ ous period of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ max was reduced to 0,@@ 75 mg higher .
about 40 % will be eliminated by elimin@@ ates and about 50 % will be converted into two primary metast@@ ases , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the un@@ ag@@ onal effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies evaluating the metabolism , CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and , in smaller dimensions , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
Eli@@ mination After a intraven@@ ous individual dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have found about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the Ur@@ als , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and un@@ altered active ingredient , about 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous bolts , the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al Clear@@ ance at 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function , the termin@@ ale elim@@ ination time , and the average systematic exposure of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , a reduction of dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , only after ex@@ positions were observed , which are considered adequate for the maximum human therapeutic exposure to indicate a low relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 out of the clinical trials are evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only a very high concentrations of ion channels , which can be involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose has been given over two years , led to a number of liver tum@@ ours , hyp@@ ophy@@ se , pancre@@ as , anne@@ x @-@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not with mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the high density of Do@@ si@@ ties and since Alo@@ xi was intended for a unique application , relev@@ ance of these results will be low as per person .
for placing this approval , the European Commission has to bring the plans to make the plans for the placing on the market for the placing on the application of the drug .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C using Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Alph@@ eon of a biological medicine named Ro@@ feron @-@ A should be similar to the same as an effective biological medicine which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference book &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ term ) hepatitis C ( one extraction of liver disease ) .
in a micro@@ sc@@ opic examination , the liver tissue points out , and the values of the liver enzymes are increased from the liver enzymes . Al@@ an@@ dic Amin@@ ot@@ mo@@ fer@@ ase ( ALT ) are increased in the blood standard .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the drug .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon reported data on the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ feron @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug using effect of effect , security and effectiveness in hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hepatitis C the effectiveness of Alph@@ eon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference to 4@@ 55 patients compared to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study was measured like many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after adjusting the treatment on the treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .

furthermore , all committed to the stability of the drug and the medicine were not sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C , which was similar to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ feron @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after setting of the treatment with Alph@@ eon Fire , the disease has more than once more than in the reference to the reference to the reference board ; Alph@@ eon more side effects .
in addition , apart from the study , the test was used to determine the question as an immune response ( i.e. the body is antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , must not be vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with a cr@@ ush@@ ation of skin detection ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( racks or sn@@ ake @-@ hours ) , sh@@ ou@@ sels , and se@@ wn wh@@ ites .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for the treatment of infections , det@@ ectable or probably due to meth@@ ic@@ il@@ la@@ mic resistant stack@@ ing stack@@ ed pile ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go is not possible against this type of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients with previously untreated skin surface should not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
in case of patient expos@@ ures after two to three days , the doctor should lead to investigate cases and alternative treatments in the treatment .
it acts of block@@ age of bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle , in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
main Indian indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was deduc@@ ted by the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients were randomized to placebo .
in the treatment of infected hood , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken into production at Hau@@ g , about 90 % of the patients were both groups on the treatment .
however , in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of Ab@@ sz@@ essen ( un@@ filled cavity in the body of tissue ) or of infections , which were det@@ ectable or possibly by MR@@ SA , not effective .
the most common secondary effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a friction on the basis .
the committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) observed that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go can be over@@ seen against the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , de@@ bac@@ on or se@@ wn wh@@ ites .
may 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a approval for the placing on the market of Al@@ tar@@ go into the entire European Union .
the patients , in which two to three days no improvements will no improvements , should still be examined and an alternative therapy to be moved ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of a sensi@@ bil@@ isation or severe local Ir@@ rit@@ ation through the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment collap@@ sed , the Sal@@ be carefully viol@@ ated and a reasonable alternative therapy of infection .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be applied for the treatment of infections , the MR@@ SA is known as Er@@ re@@ ger ( see section 5.1 ) .
clinical trials of clinical trials was the efficacy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections , which were caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in drug resistant stack@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
alternative therapy is to be moved into account when after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment , no improvements or a worsen@@ ing of infected .
the effect of simultaneous application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical funds at the same skin surface is not studied and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicine is not recommended .
due to the low plas@@ ma@@ ker@@ ations that achieved in humans after top@@ ical application for top@@ ical skin or infected surface treatment , is a clinical @-@ relevant in@@ hibition in vivo could not be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After the simultaneous gift of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin &apos;s skin from healthy adult men around 81 % .
because of the low systemic exposure to patients , it is not necessary for necessary , when top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive approach to oral dosage and are inadequate response to a statement on the birth and the fö@@ ld / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be used during pregnancy , when a top@@ ical anti @-@ bacterial therapy is clear and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of an systemic antibio@@ tic .
in the decision to continue the bre@@ ast@@ feeding / ended or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go , is being continued between the benefit of a de@@ hydr@@ ation for the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go , was the most frequently reported co@@ rit@@ ation of the administration in which about 1 % of the patients were reported .
the in@@ filtration Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance formed by fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly P@@ leu@@ rot@@ us matching eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the active mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein syn@@ thesi@@ zed by interaction on a certain binding unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ om , which differs from the binding of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al @-@ anti@@ bacterial substances .
data is believed that the Bin@@ yl@@ en@@ ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L3 is involved in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding posts and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ as@@ ez@@ ine region .
due to the binding of these binding posts P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ able , block partially P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent the normal formation of the 50s of bos@@ om@@ al sub @-@ units .
in case of local pre@@ valence of resistance the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infectious forms should be appearing at least some infectious forms should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , irrespective of whether the isol@@ ate is sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of a non @-@ smoking , the presence of stems having additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be drawn into consideration .

the sample surgery took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients each with the medium and children aged 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system inclusion in the people according to top@@ ical application of 1 % to 200 cm2 / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / h / ml ) 660 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was 50 for the P@@ GP inhibitor .

Ambi@@ rix reading the protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases which affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not yet im@@ mu@@ n against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix set up in the context of an existing vacc@@ ination plan , whereby a protection against hepatitis B should be reached only after administration of the second dose .
Ambi@@ kl@@ rix may only be used when the immun@@ ity can be used as a low risk of hepatitis B @-@ infection , and made sure that the vaccine will be carried out in two doses .
if a collection dose of hepatitis A or B is wishes , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine will be given .
the vacc@@ ines work by enabling the immune system ( the natural descent of the body ) , &quot; as it can stand against a disease .
after a child received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign d &quot; and produces antibodies to the other .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vaccine , used since 1996 , vaccine , and since 1997 , the vaccine has been approved .
the three vacc@@ ines are applied to protect against same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of one of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain some of the data that uses the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also as a reward is used for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main Indian indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of g@@ ul@@ tur@@ ally children , which had developed one month after the last injection a protective antibody concentr@@ ates .
in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six months and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
ambi@@ rix set up a month between 98 and 100 % of the g@@ ut@@ ants to a month after the last injection to develop protective power concentrations in hepatitis C and B .
the additional trial showed that the degree of the protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar at a six @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections and a 12 @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ aches , decreased appetite , pain in the inj@@ ectors , tube , mat@@ ness ( ti@@ red@@ ness ) and irrit@@ ability .
ambi@@ rix may not be sensitive to the active ingredients ( allergic to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or Ne@@ om@@ ycin ( an antibio@@ tic ) .
August 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line bi@@ ic@@ als s.@@ a. a approval for the placing on the placing of Ambi@@ rix in the entire area
the standardi@@ zation plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ zer with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccine doses , with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a collection , both for hepatitis B is used as well as hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ant vaccine or with a combination high @-@ quality vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ hepatitis B ) and anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size as after the vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ants .
it is not completely backed by the immun@@ ity people who need to be on a hepatitis B , which require a collection of hepatitis , as it does not need , because it may also be protected against immun@@ ologic memory due to immun@@ ologic memory .
3 How to all injection components should be available for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the treatment of the vaccine corresponding capabilities of medical treatment and monitoring immediately .
if a faster protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation system is recommended using the combination of the 360 ELISA virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ated Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the immune system in combination with immune system is achieved according to the basic anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ O antibody , so that in these cases , the other vaccine doses can be required .
as a intra@@ der@@ mal inj@@ ections or intra@@ mus@@ cular administration of blood in the body muscles could be avoided , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
however , with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood circulation disorders can be inj@@ ected , however , as it can be inj@@ ected in these cases after intra@@ mus@@ cular treatment .

the hepatitis C virus is usually transferred from viral load and drinks , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as swimming through bathing waters in the waters .
you can feel very tired feel , have a dark jungle to be a dark face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow search ) and other symptoms which may require a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ination , Ambi@@ rix do not protect it entirely before an infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus , even if the full vaccine series was completed with 2 doses .
if you have / your child in prior to the administration of both vaccine doses have already been infected with hepatitis or hepatitis B virus ( although you are not yet un@@ likely or ill / feels ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent the disease .
a protection against other infections , which cause the liver or symptoms which are similar to those in hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection , cannot be arranged .
• If your child has already shown a allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ ycin ( an antibio@@ tic ) .
an allergic reaction can be found through ju@@ ck@@ ative skin cre@@ ature , respiratory sick@@ ness or the tongue . • If you have a allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you have a heavy infection with fever / fever .
• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and before the administration of the second vaccine ) .
in a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second im@@ migrant , the doctor will give you to your child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix rates .
instead , it will receive you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B with a reduced content of hepatitis C virus and 10 micro@@ gramm@@ es of hepatitis C virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface treatment ) .
the second vaccine by this vaccine is generally administered with reduced content to effective content , usually a month after the first dose and should give you a vacc@@ ination before the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix on people suffer from severe blood circulation distur@@ ban@@ ces under the skin and not in the muscle disorders . • If you have / your child because of a condition or treatment in your body &apos;s own body , or if you have / your child under@@ go to a h@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response can &apos;t be given to the vacc@@ ination , so that a blood test is necessary to see how strong response to the vacc@@ ination is .
21 If you take your doctor if you get another medicine / ein@@ gs ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without forced or ) or if your child could not be vacc@@ inated or en@@ vis@@ ar@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) , or it is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient to the vaccine is not enough and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if any other vaccine will be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate positions and different types of transport .
if b@@ ush@@ rix set up at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of en@@ in@@ lob@@ ul@@ ines , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is still sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix fluctu@@ ations or mis@@ sile women are not administered , except it is highly needed , that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis B as well as hepatitis B .
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform you your doctor if your child has already shown a allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ ycin ( antibio@@ tic ) in your child .
if you don &apos;t miss the agreed appointment for the second im@@ migrant , you &apos;re talking to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in pack@@ ungen to 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and available in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the basis of the data , which has become known since the approval of the first approval for the placing on the market , the CH@@ MP has been positive that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
since Ambi@@ rix , however , only in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data are limited to this drug because of low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients with the age of over one month with in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain ) due to high ammon@@ ium concentrations ) in the history .
ammon@@ ia is divided into several individual outlets - made of food , with food , or by a Gast@@ ro@@ sto@@ mi@@ de ( through the stomach into the stomach @-@ leading hose ) or a Nas@@ en@@ son@@ de ( by the nose to the stomach @-@ leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study , because ammon@@ aps does not have to be compared with any other treatment or placebo ( a non@@ drug treatment , i.e. without drug ) .
ammon@@ ia can also be decreased in the loss of breath , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ aches , irrit@@ ability , flav@@ ours , flav@@ ours or fla@@ vor@@ ings , abdominal pain , vomiting , nausea , loss of rash , rash , mira@@ cul@@ ous body weight or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) was found that ammon@@ ia in patients with det@@ achment of ure@@ a cycle amounts to high ammon@@ ia values .
ammon@@ aps was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; because of the cause of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this drug .
the use of all patients were index@@ ed in all patients , when a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ man@@ gel was already manifest@@ ed in the new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 Living ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest@@ ed form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective , who exists after the first life mon@@ at ) , one indication is one indication of the use when using the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis of hyper@@ ammon@@ mic En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy .
for acid , for children who are not able to swal@@ lowed tablets or for patients with gor@@ ck@@ dys@@ function , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is individually calculated with respect to the protein toler@@ ance and for the growth and the development of daily protein intake of the patients .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium di@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is : • € 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg , as well as in @-@ growing and adults .
in patients who suffer an early deficiency of carb@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ let , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ lu@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ ucc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with gor@@ ck@@ disorders , as a risk of origin is not given for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ zer@@ a if the tablets does not appear immediately in the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , accordingly to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) of sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat , corresponding to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ forms heart failure or he@@ y@@ trac@@ in@@ suffici@@ en@@ in@@ suffici@@ en@@ in@@ suffici@@ en@@ in@@ suffici@@ en@@ y , as well as with sodium reproduci@@ ble and oils which are used with caution .
as met@@ abolic interest and differentiation of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and the liver takes place , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kidney disease levels .
the importance of this results in terms of pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore con@@ tra @-@ index@@ ed ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous treatment of phen@@ yl@@ ate in young rats at high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ ons and an increased loss of neur@@ ons .
we found also a galv@@ ani@@ zing matur@@ ation of zer@@ eb@@ r@@ al syn@@ ap@@ sen and a reduced number of functional nervous breakdown in brain and thus a disability in the brain growth .
it could not be found , if phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ o@@ ate the breast milk will be marked in the breast milk , and that is why the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is still un@@ locked ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at 56 % of patients at least an adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events , it was prec@@ eded by AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS in conjunction with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
an increasingly toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic patient , he@@ avier hypo@@ thesis , he@@ y@@ top@@ mie , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ ropath@@ y and pancre@@ as .
a case of over@@ do@@ ation occurred at a 5 @-@ month old small child with an active single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go through the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ o@@ ate , which showed a dos@@ ed lim@@ iting neuro@@ to@@ xi@@ fication with intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ o@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active connection , which is edited by acet@@ amine for glut@@ amine acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , that will be performed via the nuts .
stur@@ di@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen , Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine with ure@@ a ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen oxide ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine is thus suited as an alternative carriers for the differentiation of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dis@@ ruption of ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat are produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis was early on early and the treatment started to improve the survival benefit and the clinical results .
the forecast of the previously manifest@@ ed form of the disease was earlier almost always inf@@ ants , and the disease resulted in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ cking @-@ free analog computer within the first age of death .
hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ ate ) , proteins and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids was possible , the survival rate was diagnosed in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life month ) .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed with the disease in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with many to spiritual disability or other neuro@@ logy .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest@@ ed form of the disease ( including female patients with a hetero@@ geneous form of the or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ean form encephal@@ opathy and permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
even in treatment , the neuro@@ logic deficit are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logy process .
it is known that Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ate of phen@@ yl@@ ate , resulting in liver and kidney enzyme with glut@@ amine , associated with poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ abolic rate in plasma and urine were determined in accordance with a dosage of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ or in patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ abolic rate was also investigated for cancer patients after i@@ v application of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ o@@ acet@@ ate .
after an orange dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat in tabl@@ eting form , 15 minutes after taking the plas@@ ma@@ ker@@ os@@ ene intake of phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cycli@@ c disorders or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in opath@@ ies ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning should not be det@@ ectable or phen@@ yl@@ ate on the next morning .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day , in three separate doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma level , on the third day five times higher than after the first forks .
differentiation takes place within 24 hours , about 80 % of 100 % in the form of con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ g@@ glut@@ amine via the nuts .
after the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ utri@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no toxic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken by oral ( acid and children who have not swal@@ lowed up non @-@ swal@@ lowed , or patients with gor@@ ck@@ dys@@ function or by a guest tube or a Nas@@ hi@@ son@@ de .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium di@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is : • € 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 to 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg , as well as in @-@ growing and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( particularly bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um@@ prot@@ ect@@ ly should be kept within the normal range .
in patients who suffer an early deficiency of carb@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ let , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ lu@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) of sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat , corresponding to the maximum daily dose .
when R@@ atten@@ fö@@ ld before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ ate ( active Met@@ aboli@@ t of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) were exposed to lesions in the py@@ rami@@ de cells of the brain stem cells .
an increasingly toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic patient , he@@ avier hypo@@ thesis , he@@ y@@ top@@ mie , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ ropath@@ y and pancre@@ as .
stur@@ di@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen , Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine with ure@@ a ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen oxide ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine is thus suited as an alternative carriers for the differentiation of excess
on the basis of investigations about the loss of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine in patients suffering from the ure@@ st cycle , the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat are produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g Phen@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
even in treatment , the neuro@@ logic deficit are hardly reversible in treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logy process .

during the period of durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
with this procedure , the small measuring sco@@ op of 0.@@ 95 g , the middle measuring sco@@ op 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat .
if one patient needs to be obtained via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS may be dissolved before use in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , such that they are the sti@@ cking @-@ hal@@ ed waste products that can not leave according to the consumption of proteins in the body .
if you have conducted laboratory studies , you have to take the doctor that you can take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory studies .

in patients who under@@ go a PCI @-@ test , Angi@@ ox was as regards to all indicators , as He@@ par@@ in , except for heavy hem@@ or@@ ations , where it was much more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox cannot be applied in patients , the possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , other Hir@@ u@@ dine or one of the other components are used .
in addition , it must not be applied for patients who had a blood circulation , as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) was found that angi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI Express replacement of He@@ par@@ in is a removable replacement for He@@ par@@ in .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd issued a approval for the placing of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ ms ( inst@@ abil@@ e Ang@@ ina / Non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ ron ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) at an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is intended .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ gabe of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
in case of further cases a PCI is performed , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg was given and increased in@@ fusion for the duration of the input to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be included for 4 to 12 hours .
before the procedure should be administered by 0.5 mg / kg / h , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with an initial intraven@@ ous of 0,@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and an intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous an@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least one for the duration of the input .
safety and efficacy of a single Bol@@ us gift of Angi@@ ox was not studied and is not recommended when a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to 225 seconds , a second Bol@@ t was carried out of 0,3 mg / kg / body weight .
in order to reduce the incidence of lower ACT values , the re@@ formed and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully mixed and given the Bol@@ us@@ d dose of rapidly intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is not required , provided that 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney disease ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , a PCI @-@ test can be used ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine in ACS or not ) , a lower incidence rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
the ACT @-@ value is below 225 seconds , is a second Bol@@ t dose of 0.3 mg / kg , and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ ername was once again checked .
in patients with moderate kidney disease which resulted in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ trial ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , the ACT were included in the treatment of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 At patients with severe kidney compensation ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also di@@ aly@@ sis patients ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous gift of un@@ fra@@ gment He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after finishing the sub@@ cut@@ aneous treatment of low molecular He@@ par@@ in .
• In @-@ known hyper@@ sensitivity to the drug or a decrease in blood pressure due to a failure of hem@@ atop@@ as@@ es@@ ystems and / or ir@@ reversible effects . • severe kidney disease ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ m@@ ated patients
patients are carefully used during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a blood , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans is administered ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if in the PCI @-@ patient under bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , most of blood cancers can occur in patients suffering from per@@ cut@@ aneous correlation ( PCI ) in patients suffering from blood cancers .
in patients who take War@@ far@@ es and with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International norm@@ alization ratio ) should be drawn to ensure that the value of the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine could be achieved prior to the treatment .
based on the knowledge of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant men ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ sis or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , it may be assumed that these active ingredients should increase the blood hazard .
in combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ants or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ ase@@ parameters are to control the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ ase@@ parameters in each case .
the animal studies are in terms of effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adol@@ esc@@ ents and children aged six years , with diabetes type that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the upper handle or the upper arm with a insulin pump .
diabetes is a illness in which the body does not have enough insulin for the regulation of glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or insulin .
insulin ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly by human resources , and the change means that it acts faster and a shorter life is more active as a short @-@ effective human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been in use in combination with type 1 diabetes type in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body has no insulin delivery in two studies of a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children between the ages of four and 17 .
in type 2 diabetes type , in which the body insulin is not effective in the body , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main index@@ ic@@ ator for effectiveness was the modification of the substance gly@@ ce@@ mic hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type @-@ 1 diabetes after six months , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % for insulin delivery .
in adults with type 2 diabetes progression , the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0,@@ 46 % after six months , compared with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0,@@ 30 % .
A@@ pi@@ dra cannot be applied for patients who are sensitive to insulin ( allergic ) against insulin l@@ ul@@ ary or one of the other components , or in patients who suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ co@@ mia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adapted if it is administered along with a number of other drugs , which can act on the blood glu@@ er .
September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH granted approval for the placing on the market of A@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is either sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the pancre@@ as in the pancre@@ as , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection through continuous in@@ fusion in the application of abdominal belt .
due to the reduced glucose capacity and the reduced insulin delivery , insulin delivery can be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function .
every change of drugs , the brand ( Her@@ - ) , insulin @-@ delayed ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ins ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method may make a change of insulin .
3 A insufficient dosage or under@@ going a treatment , in particular in patients with ins@@ ular @-@ dependent diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ co@@ mia and a diabe@@ tic K@@ eto@@ x . these states are potential life @-@ threat@@ ening .
the change of a patient on another insulin type or insulin p@@ insulin type in another manufacturer should be carried out under strict prescri@@ ption . it is necessary to make a change of dosage .
at the time of the tre@@ ph@@ ins of a hypo@@ gly@@ co@@ mie depends on the profile of insulin used insulin and can therefore be used with the change of treatment .

heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia with consciousness can be given by intra@@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) that is treated by a doctor or by intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
after a gluten development , the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the urine for severe hypo@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia and similar episodes .
insulin in lowers the blood sugar level through stimul@@ ating the peripheral blood absorption ( in particular by skel@@ eton muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing the glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that the sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ al of insulin delivery is faster and the rate of duration is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years , insulin @-@ 1 diabetes m@@ ulation showed a proportional output of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg a proportional @-@ proportional glu@@ ing effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in the glu@@ er of the glu@@ eing effect .
insulin p@@ ul@@ in has a twice as fast effect as norm@@ alize human insulin and achieved the full glu@@ er effect of approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data was confident that in an application of insulin p@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal , a similar post@@ erior gly@@ ce@@ mic check is achieved like with human norm@@ alization that will be given 30 minutes before the meal .
insulin was done in 2 minutes before the meal , insulin @-@ post@@ ulated control was given as a normal norm@@ alize level , which was given 2 minutes before the meal , was achieved .
if insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ins will take place in 15 minutes after the meal of meal , a similar gly@@ ce@@ mic control is given as in human norm@@ alization that 2 billion were given before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
