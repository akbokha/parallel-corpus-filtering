<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets, which dissolve in the mouth) as a solution (1 mg / ml) and as a solution for injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirres Think and Sprechen, Hallucinations (listening or sinking of things that are not available), an psychological condition where the patients had manical episodes (periods of interest) alternately with periods of normal tuning.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of moderate to severe manical episodes and to prevention manical episodes in patients who are used in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is applied to the fast control of increased unrest or behaviors disorders if the medicine intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution can be applied to one or the melting tablets in patients with different diseases, where the gorges of tablets has been prepared.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who take other drugs used at the same time, the same as Abicify, should be adapted to the dose of Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurologistic" (i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of the nerve cells each.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is probably due to a "partial Agonist" for the receptors for Neurosurgeon Dopamine and 5-Hydroxytryptamine (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripistes such as 5-Hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in the larger dimensions as the neurologist, to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As Dopamine and 5-Hydroxytryptamine in schizophrenia and bipolar failure to play Aripiprazole to normalize the activity of the brain to normalize psychotic or manische symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abicify, the reoccur of symptoms, was investigated in three studies across up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was carried out in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered an increasement of two hours over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abicify was set up on 12 weeks of 347 patients with Hallify, in a other study conducted by Abilify and placebo, in which the manian symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abian fy injection solution was suffered in a study of 301 patients with bipolar error, which suffered by Lorazepam (another antipsychotherapy) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the change of symptoms in patients using a standard scale of bipolar failure or the number of patients who are applied to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies thanks to investigate how the body the melting tray and the solution can be resorbed (put into effect).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution showed patients who received Abicify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.6 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms increased than the patients who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In case of use of bipolar failure, Abilify decreased in four of five short-term symptoms and more effective as placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, and up to 74 weeks, Abilify himself served as placebo for a placebo episodes in previously treated patients and if it was in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses have also more effective than placebo the symptoms increased and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side-effects of Abicify problems (measured motion), headaches, worshippers (loss of motion), cutaneous water (increased storage production), fatigue, and exhaustion (increased storage production), fatigue and exhaustion, backlight effect, insomnie (sleeping disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The European Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal schizophrenia (CHMP), which had severe adverse episodes in bipolar-I failure and in which the manical episodes were found on the treatment with Aripirozole, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee also came to the outcome that the advantages of the injectors of injections and behaviors of patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manpolar episodes in bipolar-I error is not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted to the Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a approval for the placing on the market of Abicify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of a severe episodes of bipolar-ion and for prevention of a new episode of patients who had mostly manical episodes and their manical episodes were said to treat with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily from meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">The effectiveness of dosities with a daily dose of 15 mg has been detected, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, irrespective of meals as a single agent or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar-I- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initiating dose should be moved into account when clinical factors (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4-inductor made of the combination therapy should be reduced to the recommended dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of sucroissal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders according to a antipsychotic therapy, in some cases, in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that it was not increased in patients with bipolar error. no increased Supper in comparison to other Antipsychosis compared to other Antipsychotic.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease, heart failure, transductive disease, conditions that are applied for hypotonia (Dehydratation, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure reducers) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late-dyakinesien: in clinical trials, which a year or less digest, there were occasional reports about the treatment with Aripiprazole-law Dyskinesia.</seg>
<seg id="39">If in case of an ABILIFY treated patients signs and symptoms of a late-radyinesia, should be drawn to reduce the dose or to break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If one patient signs and symptoms developed on a mNS, or unclear fever without any additional clinical manifestation of MNS, must be set all antipsychosis, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripirozole should be used in patients with detrifles in anamnesis or crack that can be applied with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years of age with arias was associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients were treated with the Alzheimer's disease, a higher risk of death were treated compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, in one of these studies, a study with fixer dosing, a significant relationship between the dosage and the appeal of unadverse events with Aripirobenzene.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycomia, in some cases extremely and associated with Ketocapacitive or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no precise risk assessment for Hyperglycomia-related training events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic patients treated with direct adjusting.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipite, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally used in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania based on comorbities, in which weight gain as a secondary effect is observed, respectively, and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system is the particular caution offered when Aripirozole in combination with alcohol or other non-effective drugs used (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist Famotidine, a magic acid blocker, reduces the resistance rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is not relevant as a clinically.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers an highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC from Aripiprazole to 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to expect that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, like Fluoxetin and Paroxetin, similar effects and that, similar measurements should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="52">For CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolisite, the joint application can result with highly effective inhibitor of CYP3A4 in higher Plasmakerings in comparison to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you decide the treatment of Ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors, with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should not exceed the potential risks for the patients.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitor of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV protease inhibitor, are similar effects and therefore similar measurements should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="55">According to the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the Dosishess before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Ditiacem or Escolopram) or CYP2D6 are administered jointly with ABILIFY, can be converted with a standard increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials showed no significant effect on metabolic rate of CYP2D6 (Dextroduction on / 3 method method), 2C9 (Warfares), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextrombone).</seg>
<seg id="58">The patients should happen to alert their doctor when they are pregnant, or pregnancy, during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the inadequate data to security in the animal studies, this medication should not be applied in pregnancy, unless the possible benefit of justifies the potential risk of the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, the patients with other antipsychotherapy should be warned of non-dangerous machines, including strength vehicles, to operate, until they are safe that Aripies had no negative impact on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occur more often than placebo (≥ 1 / 100) as a possible medically relevant effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of below side effects is defined by the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Aripianos (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, acathisie, Dystonie and Dyskinesia were treated compared to patients who are with Halresdol. (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled study controlled over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19% was below placebo for patients under placebo treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>

<seg id="68">During long-term development phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients under Aripiprazol- Treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potential clinically significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters found, did not measure medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Construction of the CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporarily and asytorsion, were observed in 3,5% of patients treated with Arirobenzene were observed, compared to 2.0% of placebo patients.</seg>
<seg id="71">Effects on the side-side effects can occur in connection with a antipsychotic therapy, the maligy neurotic syndrome, spinal cucumulative events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycomia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">Clinical trials and since the market launch were unintended or intentionally intentionally soldered overlooked after adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>

<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate of 34% in the Arirobenzene group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanan in-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia (N = 18 or 13% of the evaluable patients) in significantly less patients receiving a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the output value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg at an average weight of approximately 5.6 kg).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with more flexible dosage of 3 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a placebo effect on placebo for over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixer dosing with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I failure, Aripiprazole showed no longer than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo-controlled single-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manical or mixed episode, Aripiprazole showed an increase in placebo effect in week 3 and a restraint effects that was comparable with lithium or Halco dol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazole discovered in week 12 a comparable portion of patients with symptomatic remission of Manie to like lithium or Halco dol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manorial or mixed episode, partly over 2 weeks, not to lithicker or Valproate monotherapist, revealed the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole a negative effect for monotherapy, compared to monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">In a placebo-controlled study over 74 weeks followed by a long-term clinical phase over 74 weeks followed by a remission rate compared to placebo superior to placebo superior to prevention of a bipolar case, predominantly with the prevention of a return.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on vitro studies the enzyme CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the Dehydration and hydroxylic of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkyector is responsible for CYP3A4 catalyst.</seg>
<seg id="89">Mean Eliminationshalbumim period is in close to 75 hours for Aripiprazole in extensive metabolic rate using CYP2D6 and for close to 146 hours in 'bad' (= "Poor") of metabolism of CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">For Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, and showed no gender-dependent effects on a pharmacokinetic examination.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-specific evaluation to pharmacokinetics did not show significant differences with regard to ethnic affiliation or the impact of the smoke in the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro in Aripima were similar in patients with severe kidney disease in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study with various liver cirrhosis (Child-dgh grade A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of the liver function, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the Class C, which is not sufficient to withdraw it at their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on security spharmacology, toxicity and repeated treatment, genotoxification and to kanogens the pre-clinical data were not visible special risks for humans.</seg>

<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis developed by Aripiprazole in the Galle of monkeys after repeated attempts of treatment of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81fold of the recommended maximum dose when humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, in the human Galle, there were no more than 6% of the concentrations in the sulphate-Konjugate concentration of hydroxylozole that were found in the study of 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In case of rabbits, these effects were according to dosities, which led to the positions of the 3- and 11fold of the middle Steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of Zoledron-acid concentration by 30% at the end of infusion, but had no effect on the area under the curve (Plasmaconcentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reducing Clearance by Cytochrom-P450-Enzymers metised substances is unlikely because Zoledronic acid is not metabolic because they have a weak or irreversible, or irreversible, depending of dependent inhibitors of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Zoledronic acid correlated with creatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This resulted in an easy (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function, up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the Zoledronlic acid required.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for severe kidney function (Kreatintic Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are available, these population are not possible.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-lettuition intravenous dose of mice was 10 mg / kg of body weight and rats 0.6 mg / kg of body weight.</seg>

<seg id="748">Infusion Informists make your doctor or pharmacies, if one of the listed side effects are significantly diminished or side effects, which are not specified in this utility.</seg>
<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR was a summary of the European public document (EPAR), which is analyzed in which the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) is evaluated in order to get recommendations on the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is applied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can not be used alone (monotherapy) in case of patients (a diabetic drug). • It can be used together with another diabetic drug (Dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (particularly important patients), it can't be used with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a Sulfonylbenzene or insulin delivery, the dose must be employed at the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycomia (low blood sugar); here you should be reduced the dose of Sulfonylharma or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be improved in better and reduces blood sugar level, thereby reducing type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients received the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy; however, patients received a combination of metformin with a Sulfonylbenzene in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosyable hemoglobin, HbA1c), which shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a reduction of HbA1c value, which means that the blood sugar values are reduced from 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg respectively.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the trial in trial, the effect of an additional treatment of acetylene in combination with metformylbenzene in a reduction of HbA1c values reduced by 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patient had been examined in addition to insulin delivery, lowering the HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months, compared to placebo, in addition to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects in relation with Accounts were visual disturbances, infections of the upper breathing (reductions), weight gain and hypothesia (low sensitivity).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients suffering from Pioglitazon or one of the other ingredients, nor in patients with liver problems, herheart failure or diabetic Ketox (high level of level of acidspar - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos as part of a single agent (at the same use) as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients who are not displayed in patients with metformin.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000, the European Commission granted TakeEurope R & D Centre Limited granted a approval for the placing on the market of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, curved and wear on a page called "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is unbeaten in uncompromising in case of contraindications or incompatibility. (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">The application of Pioglitacon for patients under 18 years are not available, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are due to the presence at least one risk factor (e.g. early heart disease or symptomatic heart disease) are endangered, the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose of continuously.</seg>
<seg id="767">The patients should be observed at the signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">The patients should be observed at the signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and ovens, when Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular Outcome study with Pioglitacon in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting for advanced pharmacopric disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase of reports on the form of heart failure, which however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output voltage-liver enzyme (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the norm) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazon cannot be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the norm range, the liver enzyme are as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If one patient symptoms have been developed to point out to a hepatic Dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, harmonics, fatigue, appetite and / or dark Harn are to check the liver enzyme.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazon is being continued, should be led by the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitacon, a dosed weight gain has been detected, which can cut fat-fat in some cases with liquid fluid.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemodilution in therapy with Pioglitazon a minor reduction in the medium hemoglobal values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with Pioglitacon (relative reduction of hemoglobin around 3.6-4.1%) and in a lower degree in patients under Sulfonylharma and insulin (relative reduction of hematopoedes by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin level in patients, Pioglitazon is used as orale two-and-times combination therapy with a Sulfonylate or as two-in combination therapy, insulin-dependent hypoglycomia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, including Pioglitazon, including Pioglitazon, an actions or deterioration of a diabetic macular edema, with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether it gives a direct connection between the intake of Pioglitazon and the occurrence of Makulaödees to be aware of a macular edema; a suitable ophthalmological analysis should be drawn into account.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarizing analysis of milled events in a randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials, over a period of up to 3.5 years, with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitacon.</seg>
<seg id="782">The fracture of 1.9 Fraktures per 100 patient was treated with Pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 fractions of 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the Proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years in patients with Pioglitazon treated patients with 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1.0 fractions of patients treated with Pioglitazon treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 frames per 100 patient years) treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of a pregnancy, and if one female patient wishes to be a pregnancy, or this one, the treatment (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the interactions of interactions have shown that Pioglitazon have no relevant effects to pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, Warfares, Phenphenoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs used by these enzymes, e.g. orangtiva, Cyclosporin, calcium-channel blocker and HMGCoA-reducer inhibitor are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with mixtures (a Cytochrom P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase of AUC from Pioglitazon to the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with rifampicin (an cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction of the AUC of Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is attributable to the treatment with Pioglitacon which is reduced in pregnancy interroinemia and increased insulin level of the mother, which reduces the availability of metabolic subsidies for föld growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very frequent &gt; 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (out of this data is not estimating).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the conversion and the board of the lens, as they are observed in other hypoglycemic effect.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazon, ALT Anstiege are many times the upper limit of the norm range, as often as placebo, however, less than in comparative groups than metformin or Sulfonylhara.</seg>
<seg id="793">In a outcome study in patients with the existing advanced pharmacopric disease, the frequency of a severe heart failure was reduced by 1.6% higher than placebo if Pioglitazon bz2.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, rare beyond heart failure of Pioglitazon reported, however, if Pioglitazon reported in combination with insulin in or in patients with heart failure in the Anamnstein.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summarized analysis of milled events in a randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials for a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon treated groups and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative group.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3.5 years in the current Proactive study, Fraktures was treated with 44 / 870 (5,1%) of patients with Pioglitazon treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="797">At taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day more than seven days did not occur.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon appears on a activation of specific nuclear power receptors (PPAR-D), which leads to the animal model for increased insulin-sensitive of liver, fat and skeleton cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon will reduce glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral blood use in case of insulin drug resistant.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclacide (monotherapy) was transferred over two years to investigate the therapeutic effectivity (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of the therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was treated by Pioglitazon at 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclacidal).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar have been adjusted according to three imonatite Optimization phase with insulin delivery, to Pioglitacon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to patients who continued only insulin in patients; a reduction of insulin delivery in the Pioglitazon treated group was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies via Pioglitazon showed consistently a statistically significant decrease in the Albumin / Kreatinin-quotient compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus Plazebo) was tested for type 2-diabetic patients in a small group of 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, placebo-triglyceride and the free fatty acids and an increase of HDL- cholesterol levels are slightly below, but clinically advanced LDL- cholesterol levels are observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies over a period of up to two years, Pioglitacon reduced the total plasmatriglyceride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared with Plazebo, Pioglitazon was no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol inmirror, while under metformin and Gliclacidal levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced the sober triglyceride, but also improved triglyceride level, both via an effect on the triglyceride Absorption as well as to the triepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the Proactive study, a cardiovascular Outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have been randomly assigned to existing anti-diabetic and cardiovascular disease either with Pioglitacon or placebo for over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After orange application, Pioglitazon is quickly resorbed, and the peak concentrations in unaltered Pioglitazon is usually achieved 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV represents the efficacy of Pioglitazon's efficacy in about three times the efficacy of Pioglitazon, while the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies could be proved that Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, Warfares, Phenphenoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with mixtures (cytochrom P450 2C8- inhibitor) or rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) reduces plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive substance Pioglitacon, markers was found mainly in the cases (55%) and to a lower degree in Harp (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-Elimination period of unaltered Pioglitazon is for people 5-6 hours, and all the active Metabolites is at 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasmakerations of Pioglitazon and its metabolic age are significantly lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy subjects, but the data of oral Clearance is similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxiological studies in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, led to the repeated administration of plasma volumes with hemodilution, anemia, and reversible kind of heart hyperba.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is attributable to the treatment with Pioglitacon which is reduced in the base-standing hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin pineties of the mother and thus reduces the availability of metabolic subsidies for föld growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hypercasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (with male rats) of the urebred epithels.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of family omatous Polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other Thiazolidindians led to a increased incidence of collector.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white up to whitish, approximately, flat and wear on one side the marking "30" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The fracture of 1.9 Fraktures per 100 patient was treated with Pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 fractions of 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the Proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years in patients with Pioglitazon treated patients with 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1.0 fractions of patients treated with Pioglitazon treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 frames per 100 patient years) treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with Pioglitazon or Gliclacidal were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease in the Albumin / Kreatinin-quotient in comparison to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced the sober triglyceride, but also improved by triglyceride levels, both via an effect on the Tryglyceride Absorption as well as to the hepatic Tryglizeride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study carried out the target with its primary endpoint syndrome, leg amputation stumbled on the buttons, non-fatal Revascularisation and Revascularisation of the leg arteries, the results are close to that of Pioglitazon no cardiovascular risk risks are connected.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white up to whitish, approximately, flat and wear on one side the marking "45" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of milled events of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitacon, with over 7,400 patients, the comparative study showed, increased incidence of bone brood for women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the Proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years in patients with Pioglitazon treated patients with 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1.0 fractions of patients treated with Pioglitazon treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 frames per 100 patient years) treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="832">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced the sober triglyceride, but also improved the postulated triglyceride level, both via an effect on the triglyceride Absorption as well as to the triepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>

<seg id="877">Prior to travel, which go over several time zones, the patient should be pointed out to the Council of its doctor because these tours can be applied, insulin in, and meals at other times, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor should be able to take account of potential impacts in treatment and to other patients suffering from them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Soviet hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycomia, which can occur at a non-controlled diabetic therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit tod in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Heavy hypoglycemia may lead to awareness and / or craps, and with temporary or permanent disruption of the brain function and even the death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Diseases of the nervous system Occasion - peripheral neuropathy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be connected with complaints to be regarded as acute painful neuropathy and normally.</seg>
<seg id="882">5 A intensification of insulin therapy with a abrupt improvement of blood glucose levels, however, can be connected to a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunossioning therapy and treatment of transplant patients should not easily integrate this drug or changes in immunosco therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to the relevant differences of the systematic exposure of Tacrolimus, it can lead to immunity or to an increased incidence of side effects, including subor overimmunity.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always keep the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage should be carried out; conversion of formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the lower control of a medical device (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">In a consequence of a change to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dose adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus will be retained.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be based on clinical assessment of evaluation and tolerability in individual cases and to blood levels (see section below)</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching to programming to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus-Talmud should be controlled by switching and over two weeks after switching.</seg>
<seg id="1416">One day 4 was the systemic exposure, measured as Talmud, with both formulations and kidney transplantations.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of the Tacrolimus-Talmud, recommended during the first two weeks after transplant under Advagraf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate effect phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Because Tacrolimus is an substance with lower Clearance, it is possible to take an adjustment of Advagraf-Dosisas several days, until the Steady State is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1419">In case of patients in the first postoperative phase, no oral intake of medicine allows the Tacrolimus treatment intravenously (Programming 5 mg / ml concentrate on the production of a infusion solution).</seg>
<seg id="1420">Duration of suppression of graft failure must be modified, the immunodeficiency must not be noted; therefore a maximum duration of oral therapy could not be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dose components - kidney transplantation prophylaxis in the graft reactions should be at 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a daily treatment in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Additional dose adjustment can be found later, since the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilizing patients after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose regimens - liver transplantation prophylaxis in the graft care - the oral Advagraf therapy should be 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift on the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Recommended dosage: conversion of programming to Advagraf must have a daily dosage of games capsules onto a once daily intake of Advagraf in order to take place in a ratio of 1: 1 (mg / mg), referring to the total daily dose to be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney cancer and liver transplantation After a change from other immunossiva on Advagraf once a day, the treatment with kidney cancer and liver transplant recommended dose for prophylaxis in the graft reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplantation in adult patients who are transported on Advagraf, is an oral initiating dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day once a day once in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplantation, who did not have any clinical experience with Advagraf in lung, pankrep- and response transplant patients in an oral initials dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and for intestinal transplantation in an orinitials dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adjustments in specific patients with reduced liver function, which can be used for maintaining of bluttalmirror in the targeted range, can be necessary in patients with severe liver abnormality of the dose.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function: the kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, it may be assumed that an dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potentials of Tacrolimus, however, thorough monitoring of kidney function (including a regular determination of serenininininin mirror, calculation of the creatinincance and monitoring of urea) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Change from Ciclosporin to Advagraf At the conversion of a Cicloset shop on a Tacrolimus-based therapy is very well suited (see sections 4.4 + 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations to the valley level in the whole blood. the dose should be based on clinical assessment of removal and tolerability in individual cases under random blood-Tacrolimus-Talrolimus-Talmud controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended for frequent controls of the Tacrolimus-Talmud during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-Talking of Tacrolimus should also be controlled according to recovery of programming to Advagraf, Dosisadjustment, changes of immunoscopic therapy or on the use of substances that could change the Tacrolimus full blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf a drug with a low Clearance is, customizations of the dose must require several days, up to the Steady State.</seg>
<seg id="1436">Data in clinical trials are able to conclude that a successful treatment in most cases is possible in the blood of 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the Talrolimus increase in thoroughbred in the first time after liver transplantations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance of liver, kidney and cardiac transplantations were generally used in blood concentrations in the range 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to severe adverse events, including graft reactions or other side effects, which can occur in a row of Tacrolimus base or interexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always keep the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage should be carried out; conversion of formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the lower control of a medical device (see section 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft reactions, which are proved compared with other immunossiva as a refractory, there are no clinical data for the retaliation formulation.</seg>
<seg id="1442">In prophylaxis, the graft ment of adult transplantation and transplants are currently no clinical data for the retaliation formulation.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to potential interactions which can lead to a herdecomposition of the tacrolimb level (hypericum perforation), or other plant sheets are included in the treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with Diarrhö, there is a particularly careful supervision of the Tacrolimus - concentrations in the blood because the Tacrolimus blood level can be subjected to these circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, less than Kardiomyopathy was called aqueous humor and Septm hyperbhie that can therefore be seen under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such soaking disorders, an treatment with corticosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver function, infections, liquid overload and oil.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunossiva, the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk or use of a solar protection, using a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">When patients who take the Tacrolimus, symptoms for pres as headaches, changed consciousness condition, herbs and visual disturbances, should have a radiological examination (e.g. B).</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since Advagraf hard capsulates, lactose, lactose, Lactose-intolerant, lactose deficiency or glucose-Galactose-maltic particular caution is offered.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicine or vegetable medicinal products which are known as inhibitors or induction of CYP3A4, can influence the metabolism of Tacrolimus, and thus reducing the blood values of Tacrolimus or reduce the blood pressure of Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Therefore, the Tacrolimusus can change the tacit of substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism, monitor and monitor the Tacrolimus dose for maintaining high levels of levels (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strong exchange effect was developed using Antimykotika such as Ketoconazol, river-conazol, Itraconazol, as well as with the Macrolid antibiotic, erythroromycin and HIV protease inhibitor (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood level mainly consisting of the increased bioavailability of Tacrolimus, caused by the inhibiting of the gastrointestinal staining.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed Prednisolone or methylprednisolon, as it is used for acute impact reactions, the concentration of Tacrolimus can increase or lower in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect of Tacrolimus on the metabolism of other drugs Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous application of Tacrolimus can be detected using CYP3A4 metrousing the metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As Tacrolimus clarify the Clearance of steroid counterantiva and thereby reducing the hormonal exposure, is particularly careful with decisions on recommended rates.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of veterans have shown that Tacrolimus will reduce the Clearance of Pentobarbital and phenazon, and its half-range is going to extend.</seg>
<seg id="1458">Results of a small number of tests on transplant cancer patients have no indication that under Tacrolimus compared to other immunossiva, a increased risk of adverse events in regard to the course and the results of the pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used for the treatment and prevention of blood cells in patients with hemophilia A (one by a deficiency of factor VIII, connected to the blood circulation).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of application may be applied to the treatment of blood, or to prevention of blood cells in surgery.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer by a factor VIII-deficiency that causes blood-related problems such as hemorations in the joints, muscles, or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted of human plasma, but according to a method that is called "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was applied to the formation of the human Gerinnation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is a different in the European Union's approved drug, is similar, but it is different, so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the application of the medicine was examined with the prevention of blood cells and surgery.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the effectiveness of Advate was honoured with the prevention of blood cells in 86% of 510 new blood donors of "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexie (fever) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be applied for patients who are sensitive to the human Gerinnate factor VIII, mouse, or Hamsterprotein or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">March 2004, the European Commission granted the Company Baxter AG granted approval for the placing on the market in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosing for the dosage and duration of sub-constitutions are addressed after the heavy-wheel of the factor VIII-Manasseh, according to the place and the extent of blood and clinical condition of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following years, the factor VIII-activity should not exceed the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period under the specified plasma level (in% of the norm or in I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection contains all 12-24 hours (8-24 hours for patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until the pain and the acute Beaches.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) and repeat the risk for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment, the control is administered to the control of the dose and the frequency of injections a appropriate determination of factor VIII-Plasmasons.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can distinguish themselves in their reaction to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery, and different levels.</seg>
<seg id="1547">Prophylaxis, a long-term prophylaxis of blood in patients with severe hemophilia A, doses lie between 20 and 40 I.E. of factor VIII per kg of body weight per kilogram of body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII-Plasmaids does not be achieved or if the blood flow with a reasonable dose must be carried out, a test must be carried out in order to show a inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitorvalues, it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be requested.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The administration speed should be set up after the patients, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutral antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Those inhibitors are always vulnerable to the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII Immunoglobuline that are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of inhibitors to develop, correlated with the quantity of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 Expositioning days is dependent on the biggest and of genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 expositionist and anamnestic inhibitor was observed, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII-product to another, the reoccur of (lowest) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare country of hemophilia A in women there are no experiences over the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and still experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1556">In the largest number of patients, inhibitors were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients), who received no higher risk on the formation of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 up to &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 1 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency on the basis of the available data).</seg>

<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients, 5 of 25 (20%) were treated with ADVATE treated inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response in the patient on tracks of contaminated proteins was analyzed by the investigation of the antibodies against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed a statistically significant upward trend of antibodies against anti-Cho-cell protein, otherwise without any signs or symptoms, found on a allergic reaction or a hypersensitivity.</seg>

<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP is based on the basis of security filtered by ADVATE, which is required by PSURs all 6 months, decided to apply for further extensions in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited presented the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products for Human Use of Li-Fraumeni-cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, the chest, the brain, the bone, or the crossover components (tissues, the other structures in the body, and is based on).</seg>
<seg id="1642">It is a kind of virus, the genesis was changed so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In the virus in Advocin, a "Adenovirus," that was changed so that there is no copies of himself to solve the people.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advocin would be injected directly into the tumours and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal type 53-protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the non-defective tissue in the human body, is usually produced to restore corrupt DNA and kill the cells when the DNA can't be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni-cancer, at which the p53 gene is defective, the p53-protein does not correct, and the cancer cells can grow and divide up.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company specified the data from a study using the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the field of substructure, in the bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP the responses of the company had been checked out to him, were still unexplained some questions.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the verification of the initially submitted documents, the CHMP has a list of questions concerning the company sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to CHMP, it was not enough that the injection of Advocin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumours brings advantages to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee had also carried out concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration, as well as security of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not enough, that Advan in reliable way can be produced in reliable way, neither does not get the environment for people who come in contact with the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company established the CHMP not of it in knowledge, whether the return consequences for people who currently undertaking clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The active agent, "means that the tablets should be made, that one of the effective ingredients are immediately, and the others is released over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergic reactions (Heuw, through an allergy or inflammation) in patients with nose-sanding (hidden nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents 12 years, the recommended dose of Aerinaze twice daily a tablet which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as possible as possible, as soon as the symptoms occur, above all the swelling of the nose retina (hidden nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be found on the alignment of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main protection dimensions were the changes of gravity of the hypocrispic symptoms which were reported by the treatment of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary, and evaluated with a standard scale, as difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all the hypothesis of the nose, the patients reported that aeropaze reported revenue, over a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared with 35,9% in patients who pseudoephedrin alone revenues.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nose was considered, the patients shown in aerosaze showed a line of symptoms by 37,4% compared to 26.7% in the patients suffering from Deslorenadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common adverse events of Aerinaze (observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients), anchored, dizziness, psychomotoric hyperactivity (weakness), constipation, headaches, fatigue, insomites (insomnia), Somnolence (bat friness), insomnia and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aeropaze may be sensitive to patients who are sensitive to Deslorenadin, pseudoephedrin or one of the other ingredients, against slumable substances or Lorate (another medicine for the treatment of allergia).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be applied in patients (increased eye pressure), flow rate (increased water pressure), Hyperthyreosis (overfunction of the thyroid) or had a hensive effect (caused by a brain injury) or a risk of hemorrhagic impact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a licence for the placing on the market of Aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, however, is to swallowed up to swallowing down (i.e. without it, or to break up).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aeropaze should not be applied to the miserable and efficacy (see Section 5.1) for children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as soon as possible, and should not be continued after the sound of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days to limit the activity of pseudoephedrin with the time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After decrease the swelling of the loop in the upper breathing for treatment, the treatment can be continued with desloratadin as a single agent.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Ainaze pseudoephedrin contains the medicine also contra-indexed in patients who are treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks after end of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphabetic activity in combination with other vasoconstrictors such as Bromocripitin, Perioemulsiamine, phenylprosy, phenylephrine, phenylephrine, ephedrin, Oxymetacolin, Napferolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not tested for this patient lessons, and the data are not enough to address corresponding recommendations for dosing.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of Aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function, and the data are not enough to address corresponding recommendations for dosing.</seg>
<seg id="1676">The patients need to be informed that the treatment is done by a hypertonie or a tachykarst or of palpitations, heart rhythms, nausea or any other neurology symptoms (such as headaches or any amplification of the headaches).</seg>
<seg id="1677">Treatment of patients with heart rhythms • patients with heart rhythms • patients with hypertension • patients with a myokardstick in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bubbles or bronchospasmus in the Anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before the implementation of the matological testing, because Antihistaminika who prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions and in its quantity.</seg>
<seg id="1679">As part of clinical trials with Desloratadin, in which erythroromycin or Ketoconazol were given, however, no clinical trials or changes of Plasmaatadin was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotoric tests have no significant differences between the suffering of Desloratadin and placebo treated with placebo patients, irrespective of whether Deshiatadin alone or alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Responsible for the Metabolism of Deslorate-responsible enzyme was not identified, so that interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin in vivo CYP3A4 could not be inhibits and in-vitro studies show that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibits and neither a substrate still a inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The dissatisfaction of the application of Aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, but did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since the reproduction studies of animals can not always be transferred to people and based on the vasoconstrian properties of pseudoephedrin should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be clarified in very rare cases that can be found in very rare cases that may lead to a funeral of transportation or ability to serve the ability of machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a ZNS Depression (Seaning, Apnoe, cardiovascular attention, cyanose, compresses, cardiovascular disease) and a ZNS stimulation (insomnia, Hallucinations, Tremor, Konvulsions) with possible lettering.</seg>

<seg id="1688">A ZNS stimululation is especially likely, as well as Atropin-typical symptoms (mouth drying, pupil size, and diecation, skin, Hyperthermal and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include the inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 of human mastering cells / basophiles, as well as inhibiting expression of the expression of the Adhesive P-Seltin.</seg>
<seg id="1690">For a single dose study using adult Deshiatadin 5 mg no influence on standard measuring sizes of the flight sizes, including the amplifying subjective bats or tasks that are connected to the fittings.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily was no increased incidence of strokes compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrin in the recommended dosage can be found in an impressive level of blood pressure, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachykaraoke or manifestations of a ZNS-Era.</seg>
<seg id="1693">It took 1.248 patients at the age between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic reactions, who received 414 patients Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histaminated efficacy of aerobaze tablets, determined by the overall ranking for the symptomatic (except Nasal sanding) significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrin for the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerobaze tablets as regards to the fluctuating effect, determined using the nose sanding, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Deslorenadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerobaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin defined in patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study to the pharmacokinetics of Aeropaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze in healthy subjects over 14 days the feeding equation of Desloratadin, 3-Hydroxyloatadin and pseudoephedrin to Day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetic multi-doscope study which was carried out with formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, has been demonstrated that four persons Deshiatadin was poor.</seg>
<seg id="1700">An electronic intercourse study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrin bioequivalent was the exposure to an aerobinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies for security spharmacology, at the toxicity of repeated treatment for genotoxification and to achieve the pre-clinical data with Deshiatadin, however, has no special risks for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no larger toxicity than their individual components, and the observed effects were found in general in the context of pseudoephedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrin was the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrin in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and at rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and Module 1.8.1 of the Marketing Authorisation Application Convigilance System is well established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius has been examined in total eight studies of approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic Rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergic reactions and two studies of patients who had also asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by eliminating the change of symptoms (jucketing, number and size of squares, funeral for sleeping and the efficiency on the days) and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">There were further studies published in order to prove the body the syrup, the solution can take into the same way as the tablets as well as the tablets as well as the use of children in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The results of all studies were taken into account when the results of all studies were taken together with 5 mg Aerius an average decrease of the symptoms (symptoms) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies in Urtikaria, the decline of the symptoms in six weeks after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared to placebo patients treated with placebo patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius cannot be applied for patients who are sensitive to Deshiatadin, Lorraadin or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">January 2001, the European Commission signed a licence for the placing on the market of Aerius in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with or without a meal, for delivery of symptoms in allergic Rhinitis (including interrupt and persistian allergic reactions) and Urtikaria (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience from clinical trials for effectiveness in the application of Deslorenadin for adolescents aged 12 to 17 (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">Treatment of intermitment allergic reactions (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to date of date, and can be ended after the crash of symptoms and upon their return.</seg>
<seg id="1732">The persamic allergic reactions (occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended for the treatment during allergigiev.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinical trials have been observed in clinical studies of clinical studies with Desloratadin tablets, in addition to those who were given to erythroromycin or Ketoconazol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study, the intake of Aerius and alcohol has not reinforced the performance effect of alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be resolved to clarified that it can be observed in very rare cases that may lead to a impairment of traffic or ability to serve the ability of machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical trials carried out in various indications, including allergic Rhinitis and chronic idiopathic Ural Urtikaria, reported 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most frequently used side-effects, over more common than in placebo was fatigue (1,2%), bad breath (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical trial of 578 adolescent patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common secondary action can be treated with 5.1% of patients who were treated with Desloratadin and 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study that reaches up to 45 mg Desloratadin (ninety-time clinical dose), no clinical relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 of human mastering cells / basophiles, as well as inhibiting the expression of the Adhesive P-seless on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">As part of a clinical trial with multiple doses, within a dose of up to 20 mg daily, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, at the Deshiatadin in a dose of 45 mg daily (which is a time of clinical trial), no extension of the Qtc intervals.</seg>

<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic Rhino Aerius was effective at the link of symptoms such as Niesen, Nashies and Jucketing of the nose, jucketing, lacrimal and tube incentive to the palate as well as jucketing on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in saisonal and perennial, allergic Rhino can be divided into a dependence of duration of symptoms as well as in intermitting allergic reactions and persutating allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermiter allergic Rhinestone is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persamic allergic reactions will defined as occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As the result of the overall assessment of the questionnaire on life of quality of life in the Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius was effectively caused by seasonal allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic Urtikaria was investigated on the other forms of Urtikaria, because the underlying pathophysiology is unparalleled to the different forms, and chronic patients can be recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine disease is expected to consider that Deslorenadin has also been observed in other forms of inflammatory diseases in other forms of urine for chronic idiopathic diseases; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic Urtikaria was Aerius effective at the improvement of Pruritus and the size of squares and number of squares at the end of the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="1752">Like in other studies with antihistaminika near chronic idiopathic Ural Urtikaria, the minority of patients who did not work on antihistaminika redesigned, from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in the Juckreid by more than 50% was observed at 55% of patients treated with Deshiatadin patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo patients.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius reduced the disorder of sleep and the juniper, as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetics study which was comparable to patients with the general, allergic reactions of population was comparable to 4% of patients a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no additional points for clinically relevant Kumulation following a daily application of Desloratadin (5 mg) than 14 days before.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolic ism of distillation was not identified, so that interactions with other drugs are not excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin in vivo did not have CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies show that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibits and neither a substrate still a inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dosed study with Desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fetus) did not reduce the availability of Deshiatadin in a daily dose of 7.5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The study carried out by Deshiatadin and Loratadin in a comparable degree of the exposure of Desloratadin, no qualitative or quantitative differences in regards to the toxicity of Desloratadin and Lorraadin in a similar degree.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on security spharmacology, toxicity of repeated treatment, genotoxification and to achieve the pre-clinical data with Deshiatadin no special risks for humans.</seg>

<seg id="1764">The doctor should be aware that most cases of Rhinolbei children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see below paragraph 4.4) and that no data can be taken over treatment of an infectious diseases with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the expulsion of upper breathing or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis could play Anamnesis, physical investigations and corresponding laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children aged 2 to 11 years metabolised Desloratadin and experienced a higher subdistance load (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">Safety of Aerius Sirup in children between 2 and 11 years, which is restricted to metroise, is identical to the children of children who are normal metabolic.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This drug contains sucrose and sorbol; therefore, people should not take care of problems such as fruit-tolerance, glucose-gactose absorbent or a sacral-isomaltas- insufficieny of this drug.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinical trials have been observed in clinical studies of clinical trials with Aerius tablets not found where erythroromycin or Ketoconazol was also given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study, the intake of Aerius tablets and alcohol does not intensify the performance effect of alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The total reading of the adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to Aerius Sirup group, similar to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Clinical trials of adults with adults and adolescents in various indications, including allergic reactions and chronic idiopathic Ural Ural, were reported in the recommended dose 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multi-dose study of adults and young people, at up to 45 mg Desloratadin (ninety-time clinical dose), no clinical relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 years, who came to an antihistamine therapy in question, received a daily Deshich dose of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic Rhino / chronically idiopathic and children are similar to adults and children, the efficacy data of Desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated in adults.</seg>
<seg id="1776">As part of a clinical trial involving additional doses and adolescents in a dose of up to 20 mg daily. no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a daily dose of up to 20 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharmacological study of adults and adolescents in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine-time clinical trial) of more than ten days in adults, no extension of the Qtc intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of strokes compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">In a single daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius identifies tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials to any impairment of the psychomotoric.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical-pharmacological studies in adults, the simultaneous intake of alcohol does not permit to amplification of the alcohol-induced performance even to an increase in the bat.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic Rhinoppressed, Aerius tablets were effective at the lintion of symptoms such as Niesen, Nashiinction and Jucketing of the nose, juckincentive, lacrimal and tube incentive to the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As the result of the overall assessment of the questionnaire on life of quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, decreased Aerius tablets effective which caused by seasonal allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic Urtikaria was Aerius effective at the improvement of Pruritus and the size of squares and number of squares at the end of the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The dissemination of this characteristic metisomite was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6% adults, 16% children) than in Kaukasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic patients with a siupuncement of children aged 2 to 11 years with allergic Rhinoly, which was restricted to metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The burden (AUC) by Desloratadin was about 3 to 6 hours and the Cmax is about 3 to 4 times higher with a time half-time time of about 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no additional points of clinical-relevant drug abuse after once daily application of Desloratadin (5 - 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In various single dose trials showed that AUC- and Cmax values of Desloratadin in the recommended doses were comparable with those of adults, the Deslorenadin-Sirup in a dose of 5 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1896">An Grippepanemia breaks, when a new strain of Grippevirus is mentioned, who can spread to human beings, because the people do not have any immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system contained in the vaccine contained parts of the flu virus as "body-foreign" and forms the antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This system allows the immune system later to form an contact with an Grippevirus of this Stamms faster.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membranes of the virus was then separated with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membranes of the membranes that the human body can be cleaned out), and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="1911">Ageneric was examined in combination with other antiviral medicine, but without Ritonavir, were examined in two major studies with 736 HIV-infected adults, which had previously treated with protease inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The low-grade Ritonavir reinforced product Agenerase was taken at 206 adults, which were formerly used by protease inhibitor, compared with other protease inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Main Indian indicator for effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non-detectable concentrations of HIV in the blood (viral load) or change from viral load according to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the patients with patients who had not taken a protease inhibitor, although more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Ageneric decreased the viral load, but by the children who had been treated with protease inhibitor, were only very few at the treatment.</seg>

<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Ageneric capsules is 20 mg of Ambavir / kg body weight per day in combination with other antiretroviral medication up to a daily highest dose of 2400 mg of Ambavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of aging in combination with low doses of ritonavir or other protease inhibitor were not studied at children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for the application of children under 4 years, due to the failures of data to dissatisfaction and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacokinetic data, the dose should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function to 300 mg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be carried out in patients with lighter or regular liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver function, it is contra-indexed (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase may not be given at the same time with medicine which have a low therapeutic width and also Substrate of the cytochrom P450-isailms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>

<seg id="1939">The patients should be noted that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy are not able to help healing the HIV infection that they also still remain in the opportunist infections or other complications of a HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including the treatment with Ageneric prevents the risk of an transfer of HIV to other by sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Ageneric capsules also have to be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicine (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Ageneric, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI have been included in the part study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis introduced non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group (HIV-1-RNA) in plasma welding (HIV-1 RNA) compared to 16 weeks in order to be a non-fold disease shaft of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbounding Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18 years, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Ageneric solution was made daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The majority of the PI was given at the same time; the majority of the PI-treated patients had at least one (78%) or two (42%) together with Agenerase NRTIs together with Ageneric.</seg>

<seg id="2042">In the process optimisation, 19 Basics on this data should be drawn to the expected children of "unboiling" Agenerase "in the process optimisation.</seg>
<seg id="2043">According to oral administration, the average duration (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Ambavir amounts to about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increases, for Cmax against 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) are administered together with Ambavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Ambavir with a meal leads to a 25% decline of AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Ambavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State State (Cmin, ss) was influenced by the food intake, although the simultaneous intake of the extent and the rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be found on a large distribution volume as well as an incomparable penetration of Ambavir.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the concentration of drug in plasma, whereby the amount of incomparable amblown, which represents the active percentage, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of incomparable Ambavir is constant at constant level, the percentage of the percentage of active substances in the steady concentration in the Steady State Court over the range of Cmax, ss up to Cmin.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, the CYP3A4 cells or inhibits should be administered and a substrat of CYP3A4, which are given with caution if they are given at the same time (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Ageneric capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amblown exposure like in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambavir is made up of 14% less bioavailable as from the capsules; therefore, Agenera solution are not interchangeable for a milligrammar school interchangeable.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of a kidney function should be low on Elimination of Ambavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schematics lead to Ambavir plasma layer comparable to any dose of 1200 mg of Ambavir twice a day without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long term studies with Ambavir in mice and rats were found in male animals with male animals in mice the 2.0-fold (mice) of the exposure of people, according to twice daily treatment of 1200 mg of Ambavir.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of the drug was investigated, however, its effectiveness was measured in terms of reduction of GAG concentration in urine and in terms of the size of the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2278">With children under five years Aldurazyme was the GAG concentration in Urquium around 60%, and half of the treated children reported a normal liver on the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme have been observed in the age of over five years (one of 10 patients), nausea, abdominal pain, rash, pain in the body (in hands and feet), heat-sensation, fever and reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measured size of lung function), tachykarat (accelerated heart rate), fever and Schüttela.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be sensitive to laronidase (allergic) to Laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic response), not to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) is required every year all the new information that may be published and update this summary required.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The producer of Aldurazyme is received for patients who observe Aldurazyme as regards the reactions to Infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">June 2003, the European Commission granted Gutenazyme Company granted approval for the placing on the market of Aldurazyme into the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a combinant form of human vision -L-Iduronidase and is produced using a combined DNA technology under the use of Cho-Mammtier cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, ovstock of the Chinese HAMSTERS).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is for long-term enzymes in patients with the diagnosis of a Muerysaccharides I (MPS I, α-L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurology of disease infection (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other metabolic disease.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be used if the patient carries it all 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">Safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years was not determined, and for those patients can not be recommended for this patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney disease or liver insufficiensic efficiency has not been determined, and for those patients can not be recommended for this patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">With Aldurazyma treatment, patients can develop infusion reactions, defined as each in connection, which during infusion or by the end of the infusion chamber appearance (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason these patients should also be monitored cutting, and the fusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment where the refusion of medical devices are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, nearly all patients IgG antibodies directed against Laronidase, usually within 3 months of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients receiving antibodies or symptoms of a infusion reaction, must be addressed in use of Aldurazyme with caution (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience regarding the resumption of the treatment after a longer period of interruption, however, due to the theoretically increased risk of risk reaction after a interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medications (antihistaminika and / or anti-trick), to minimize the potential actions unrelated reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a light or medium-heavy reaction-related response, the treatment with antihistaminika and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen should be weighed and / or a reduction of infusion rate to half of the infusion rate.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, heavy infusion reaction, the infusion work must be halted, until the symptoms were brought to decline, a treatment with antihistaminika and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be achieved with a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the reaction has been resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2300">The response rate (antihistaminika and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen and / or Corticosteroids) as well as a reduction rate of infusion rate is 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied at the same time with chloroquin or Procain because a potential risk of an interrupt with the intraocular intake of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal studies can not be found on direct or indirect effects of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">There is no data to New natives who were expironed with Laronidase over the mother's milk, is recommended to use during the treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Clinical trials carried out mainly as infusion-related reactions, which were observed at 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2305">The patients with Aldurazyme, who were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension of a total of 45 patients have been observed in the following table: very often (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I, the participation in the upper breathing and lungs in the history also severe reactions were related to, including bronchiospasmus, breathing and visual acuity (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children of adverse impacts in relation to Aldurazyme, who were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, were reported with heavy duty-form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, it was within 3 months after the treatment of a seroconversion, where in the age of 5 patients usually come to a seroconversion (average after 26 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">By the end of the phase 3 study (or until an early departure from the study), 13 / 45 patients were not detectable by Radioimmunoassay (RIP) assay, which was never come to seroconstrictors.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with ablow up to low power levels had a robust reduction of GAG mirror in Harn, while in patients with high antibodies had a variable reduction of GAG in the harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutral operating effect on enzyme Laronization activity in vitro which did not affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in the harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear in connection with the incidence of unwanted Medication activities, even if the occurrence of unwanted Food and antibodies are typically kept together with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The accusation for the enzyme therapy lies in one of the hydrolysis of the acute Substrate Substrate and the determination of a further accumulation in recovery of enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation system and cells into the Lysosomes, the most probable via Mannose-6-phosphorus receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were randomized in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study at the age of 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited to recruitment the entire spectrum of sickness, the majority of patients were found in the middle phenotype, and only one patient showed the heavy phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited when they had a strong expiration volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to walk 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were recruited for an open-label extension study, where she received more than 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week 100 E / kg of Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patient had treated with Aldurazyme, compared to the placebo group, improving the lung function and the assistants which is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintain this effects of up to 208 weeks in derAldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and a placebo group of 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decline of the expected value of the value, is no significant and the absolute lung-volumes increased to be proportional to the body-growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomical before treatment reached 22 (85%) by the end of the study a normal liver.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear waste of GAG mirror was found in the Harn (µg / mg of Kreatinin) which remained constant at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In case of a heterogenous point of sickness such a combined final results, FEV, distance in the 6-minute walk, there was no change in patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">The two-year-old Phase 2 study carried out in which mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme was studied at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years old (16 patients with heavy-shape design and 4 with the mean follow-up).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients, the dosage was increased due to an increased GAG- mirrors in the last 26 weeks in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was found after the Z-Score (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-of-form-form, while in the older patients with heavy-form, only limited, or even no progress were found in the cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations into pharmakodynamic effects of different Aldurazyme docking schematics based on GAG mirror in Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute period were performed.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The docking scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks in patients who have trouble with weekly infusion. however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two docking schematics is equal.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) is enhanced with all new information that will be available, each year, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug is updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokineapple profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to the affected in older and less strong patients.</seg>

<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood is changed, or in which certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be reduced, or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetry evaporation is therefore prevented the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells divide.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The conversion of Pemetrexed in its active form is lighter than in healthy cells, which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug using a longer period of effect in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In a major study of 456 patients, Alimta was investigated in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">The effects of non-small cell lung cancer the effects of Alimta were treated in a study to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which had previously treated with chemotherapy compared with effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>

<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be broken if in patients after 2 dose inductive or non-hemological toxicity or 4 or 4 occurs or sooner if the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neuroretinal sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical trials did not note that in patients with aged 65, or higher, compared to patients aged 65, it was increased by means of an increased secondary effective risk.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for the application of children under 18 years due to sufficient data for dissemination and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">Clinical trials were necessary in clinical trials with a creatinin-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, no dose adaptations which goes beyond all patients recommended Dosisations.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin-Clearance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with an liver function limitation of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper side value and / or transaminase values of &gt; to 3.0-fold of the upper limit value (in case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0-fold of the upper limit value (with presence of liver metastases) were not studied in studies.</seg>

<seg id="2615">In case of dolasetron, these values are 63% for alasetron (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted the City of Helsinki / Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. concluded a approval for the placing of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi was indexed on the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting for heavily emented chemotherapy due to a cancer condition and vomiting for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi on the prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a strong emented chemotherapy, can be strengthened by adding a corticosterity in front of the chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colonic filenage, patients with anamnesty Observer or signs of a subacute Ileus according to the injection unit.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, with other 5HT3 antagonists, the particular caution is offered with the treatment of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT-interval or in patients with the QT- interval, or to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with a further chemotherapy regimens, Aloxi was not to be used for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy alone.</seg>

<seg id="2625">Experience to the use of Palonosetron at human gesters are not, therefore, Palonosetron should not be applied, unless it is necessary for the treating doctor than necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common in clinical trials with a dose of 250 micrograms (altogether 633 patients), at least possibly associated with Aloxi in connection, headaches (9%) and Obachs (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity and reactions to the administration site (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing- experience.</seg>

<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strongly emented chemotherapy are combined in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">Clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) were similar to blood pressure, heart rate and EKG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of clinical trials, Palonosetron has the ability to blocking the ventricular De- and Repolarisation of the Iion channels to extend and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>

<seg id="2638">After intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses were measured at 11 testicle cancer patients between day 1 and day 5 (± SD) increase in Palonosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokineapple simulations that once daily was comparable to an intravenous edition of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron (AUC0- ∞) compared to a single intravenous period of 0.75 mg. however, the Cmax was reduced to 0,75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% will be eliminated by eliminates and about 50% will be converted into two primary metastases, compared to Palonosetron over less than 1% of the unagonal effect on 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies evaluating the metabolism, CYP2D6 and, in smaller dimensions, the CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous individual dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron have found about 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the Urals, Palonosetron and unaltered active ingredient, about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous bolts, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal Clearance at 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function, the terminale elimination time, and the average systematic exposure of Palonosetron increases, a reduction of dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials, only after expositions were observed, which are considered adequate for the maximum human therapeutic exposure to indicate a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of the clinical trials are evidence that Palonosetron can block only a very high concentrations of ion channels, which can be involved in ventricular De- and Repolarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose has been given over two years, led to a number of liver tumours, hypophyse, pancreas, annex-mark) and skin tumors in rats, but not with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the high density of Dosities and since Aloxi was intended for a unique application, relevance of these results will be low as per person.</seg>

<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon of a biological medicine named Roferon-A should be similar to the same as an effective biological medicine which is already approved in the EU (also called "reference book").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-term) hepatitis C (one extraction of liver disease).</seg>

<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of impetigo (one with a crushation of skin detection) and small infected Lazerations (racks or snake-hours), shousels, and sewn whites.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used for the treatment of infections, detectable or probably due to methicillamic resistant stacking stacked pile (MRSA) because Alargo is not possible against this type of infections.</seg>

<seg id="2682">The most common secondary effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a friction on the basis.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) observed that the benefits of Altargo can be overseen against the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small Lazerations, debacon or sewn whites.</seg>
<seg id="2684">May 2007, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Ltd. a approval for the placing on the market of Altargo into the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be applied for the treatment of infections, the MRSA is known as Erreger (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">Clinical trials of clinical trials was the efficacy of Retapamulin in patients with infections, which were caused by a methicillin drug resistant stackhylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy is to be moved into account when after a 2- or 3-day treatment, no improvements or a worsening of infected.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous application of Retapamulin and other topical funds at the same skin surface is not studied and the simultaneous application of other topical medicine is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasmakerations that achieved in humans after topical application for topical skin or infected surface treatment, is a clinical-relevant inhibition in vivo could not be expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the simultaneous gift of 2-times daily 200 mg Ketoconazol increased the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% Retapamulin's skin from healthy adult men around 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Because of the low systemic exposure to patients, it is not necessary for necessary, when topical Retapamulin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>

<seg id="2698">The infiltration Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance formed by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus matching eckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesized by interaction on a certain binding unit of the bacterial Ribosom, which differs from the binding of other ribosomal-antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data is believed that the Binylenribosomales Protein L3 is involved in the region of ribosomal P-binding posts and the Peptidyltransferasezine region.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Due to the binding of these binding posts Pleuromutiline the peptidylable, block partially P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of the 50s of bosomal sub-units.</seg>
<seg id="2702">In case of local prevalence of resistance the application of Retapamulin at least some infectious forms should be appearing at least some infectious forms should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus, irrespective of whether the isolate is sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of a non-smoking, the presence of stems having additional viral factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be drawn into consideration.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix reading the protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases which affect the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years, which are not yet immun against these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix set up in the context of an existing vaccination plan, whereby a protection against hepatitis B should be reached only after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">Ambiklrix may only be used when the immunity can be used as a low risk of hepatitis B-infection, and made sure that the vaccine will be carried out in two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a collection dose of hepatitis A or B is wishes, Ambirix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine will be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">The vaccines work by enabling the immune system (the natural descent of the body), "as it can stand against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as "foreign d" and produces antibodies to the other.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the vaccine, used since 1996, vaccine, and since 1997, the vaccine has been approved.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to protect against same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of one of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain some of the data that uses the application of Twinrix adults, also as a reward is used for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main Indian indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of gulturally children, which had developed one month after the last injection a protective antibody concentrates.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six months and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix set up a month between 98 and 100% of the gutants to a month after the last injection to develop protective power concentrations in hepatitis C and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional trial showed that the degree of the protection of Ambirix was similar at a six-month gap between the injections and a 12-month distance between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headaches, decreased appetite, pain in the injectors, tube, matness (tiredness) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be sensitive to the active ingredients (allergic to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission granted the company GlaxoSmithKline biicals s.a. a approval for the placing on the placing of Ambirix in the entire area</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the Grundimmunzer with Ambirix consists of two vaccine doses, with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a collection, both for hepatitis B is used as well as hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalant vaccine or with a combination high-quality vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-hepatitis B) and anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HAV) anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same size as after the vaccination with the respective monovalants.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not completely backed by the immunity people who need to be on a hepatitis B, which require a collection of hepatitis, as it does not need, because it may also be protected against immunologic memory due to immunologic memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 How to all injection components should be available for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the treatment of the vaccine corresponding capabilities of medical treatment and monitoring immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a faster protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization system is recommended using the combination of the 360 ELISA virus and 10 µg recombinated Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">The immune system in combination with immune system is achieved according to the basic anti-HAV- and anti-HBO antibody, so that in these cases, the other vaccine doses can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">As a intradermal injections or intramuscular administration of blood in the body muscles could be avoided, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, with thrombocytopenia or blood circulation disorders can be injected, however, as it can be injected in these cases after intramuscular treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix set up a separate injection at the same time with a combined Diphtherian, inactivating Poliomyelitisans and Haemophilus (DTPa-IPV / Hib), the immune response was given to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunossiver therapy or in patients with immunodeficiency, it must be assumed that no adequate immune response will be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical trial which leads with 3 vaccination of this formulation, the frequency of pain, pulsion, swelling, depridetis, headaches and fever comparable with the frequency which was observed in the former Thiomerang and preservative vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccine doses were administered a total of 1027 vaccine at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared to the 3-doses.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions, the higher dosage were pain of pain and Matity on a calculation basis per vaccine dose, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix on 50,7% of the subjects were observed, compared with 39,1% after the treatment of a dose of 3 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects were given to the ambiance, over pain, over 63,8% with the subjects who had vaccinated with the 3-Dosricane vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of Mateness had comparable high (i.e. above all the vaccine cycle at 39,6% of the persons, the Ambirix were compared to 36.2% with the subjects who received the 3-doses (combination table).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency pronounced pain was low and comparable to the administration, which was observed according to administration of the combination, with the 3-doses vaccine was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old vaccines the appearance of local actions and is comparable with the 3-doses of combination with 360 ELISA tests in the hepatitis C virus and 10 µg recombinated hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, on 6 to 11- year-old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a little figs of pain (on the injector) per dose, not per prompt.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The vaccine is vaccination to vaccine during the 2-cans vaccination during the 3-cans vaccination with a combination of 360 ELISA- units inactivated hepatitis C virus and 10 µg recombinated hepatitis C virus, was statistically not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">Clinical trials, which were carried out at the age of 1 to including 15 years, Serconjunctions had been carried out for anti-HAV 99,1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, the month 6 month dose (i.e. in the month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum rates for anti-HBs were 74,2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, the month 6 was administered dose (i.e. in the month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study, which was conducted between 12- and including 15-year-old, received 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 the standard combinations with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunity was detected, the seroprotectionery (SP in the table below) were significantly higher than hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the 3-dose-impregnancies.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immunoresponses, which were reached in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old one month after the full vaccination series (i.e. in the month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccinations have either a 2-doses vaccines with an ambient tube or a 3-doses vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA inactivated hepatitis C virus and 10µg recombinated hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">People aged 12 to 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HB's antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after the immunoassay and ambition in 0-6-month vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune reaction to both antigens was comparable to the vaccination of 3 doses with a combination table, consisting of 360 ELISA - A virus and 10 µg recombinated hepatitis B surface antigen used in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial between 12- and including 15-year-olds said that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBO-antibodies is comparable to the 0-6 month vaccination, which is comparable to the 0-12 months of vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix set up a combined Diphtherian, inactivating Poliomyelitisation and 8 Haemophilus (DTPa-IPV / Hib), with the first dose of a combined masons-mquail vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study that was carried out with 3 doses of the current formulation of adults, showed the current formulation of similar seroprotectant and serum transfer rates such as the previous formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2805">Based on the basis of the data, which has become known since the approval of the first approval for the placing on the market, the CHMP has been positive that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix, however, only in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data are limited to this drug because of low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients with the age of over one month with incomplete Enzymdefect or with hyperammonia Encephalopathy (brain) due to high ammonium concentrations) in the history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia is divided into several individual outlets - made of food, with food, or by a Gastrostomide (through the stomach into the stomach-leading hose) or a Nasensonde (by the nose to the stomach-leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, because ammonaps does not have to be compared with any other treatment or placebo (a nondrug treatment, i.e. without drug).</seg>

<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) was found that ammonia in patients with detachment of urea cycle amounts to high ammonia values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonaps was approved under "extraordinary circumstances" because of the cause of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this drug.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use of all patients were indexed in all patients, when a complete Enzymmangel was already manifested in the newborns (within the first 28 Living).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifested form (incomplete Enzymdefective, who exists after the first life monat), one indication is one indication of the use when using the anamnesis of hyperammonmic Encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For acid, for children who are not able to swallowed tablets or for patients with gorckdysfunction, AMMONAPS is also available in granulatform.</seg>

<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium diylbutyrat is: • €450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg, as well as in-growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer an early deficiency of carbamylphosphatsynthetase or ornithintranscarlet, the substitution of Citlulin or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an argininosuccinatsynthase deficiency must receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with gorckdisorders, as a risk of origin is not given for the emergence of Ösophagulzera if the tablets does not appear immediately in the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, accordingly to 2.5 g (108 mmol) of sodium per 20 g sodium phenyl butyrat, corresponding to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with conforms heart failure or heytracinsufficieninsufficieninsufficieninsufficieny, as well as with sodium reproducible and oils which are used with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">As metabolic interest and differentiation of sodium phenylbutyrat and the liver takes place, AMMONAPS should be used in patients with liver or kidney disease levels.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of this results in terms of pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contra-indexed (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous treatment of phenylate in young rats at high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowdown of neurons and an increased loss of neurons.</seg>

<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart failure to help the blood flow to the heart and the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine in relation to blood pressure) with Heparin (another anticoagulans) and a GPI compared to GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patients frequently used a stent (a short tube, which left in Arterie to prevent a delay), and additionally received other drugs to prevent hemorrhages, such as Abciximab, and Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - in relation to new events (deaths, heart rate or Revascularization) after 30 days or a year as well as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who undergo a PCI-test, Angiox was as regards to all indicators, as Heparin, except for heavy hemorations, where it was much more effective than Heparin.</seg>
