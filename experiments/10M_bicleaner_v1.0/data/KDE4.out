a rect@@ angle can be displayed with the various properties of the corresponding file , or if sufficient space is to be used , if there are sufficient space due to limitations with the sign of Tre@@ em@@ ap . furthermore , you can transfer the relative position of labelling in rect@@ angle .
at Dar@@ em@@ ap for Tre@@ em@@ aps should be noted that the area is proportional to the size of the entries , and this setting is not always available . please note that less space is lost , if the rect@@ angle is square , when the rect@@ angle is square .
as the allocation of the area of a single agreement is done to the implementation . here it is possible to prevent the restrictions and to avoid sub@@ mer@@ ing areas as part of the square , the rect@@ angle , which are as possible . the best methods are in terms of rows , columns , or recur@@ sive , .
you can view the minimal surface for an entry into the area of the menu view . instead , a rob@@ bed pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level agreement , in order to indicate that this area is actually characterized by an under@@ level entry .

what is a digital inventory in the part of the process , taking part in the process of digital and permanent capture . each of the photos takes place , sc@@ ans or digital photos uses a form of digital inventory . most of us make it not in a systematic and efficient manner .
we give you a tool to use a plan and practical tips such as you can use the procedures for digital phot@@ ogra@@ ms to take care of your images . we look at the procedure for digital phot@@ ogra@@ ms ; let &apos;s say that we would like to assure you to communicate , cur@@ ls , index@@ ing , archi@@ ved , and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; digital inventory administration , is categorized , consulting , sear@@ ches , trans@@ acted , packaged and exported content across a mon@@ et@@ or and cultural value . quot ;
met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data via data . met@@ ad@@ ata are provided according to your definition data , which can provide information about or documentation of other data provided by an application or environment .
to claim , if you don &apos;t know more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t know it . if you don &apos;t know how many photos you don &apos;t know it . this approach the met@@ ad@@ ata can save both in a database , and secure archiving rapidly to you with other programs , platforms and formats .
what you do you need to know what you must have any information in your system . you must decide whether you want to save other photos on your computer , if you want to save them on a reserved drive , or to a power drive , etc ; click here that you have to change out a larger drive .
perhaps you are happy with this structure . your other photos can be found in several times in the same place . if you have enough photos , you will be able to print a file like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for pictures you can print or on a web page .
professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archiving , working processes , constant transfer of images to different topics and a large number of above . within 10 years 95 % Archive and 5 % work files and you will not want to organize your structure for this content .
what kind of files fit together ? the separation of data types makes stack@@ ing machine . separate new from old files .
the separation from original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know whether you are looking for an original or retri@@ eval picture .
we also recommend the option of met@@ ad@@ ata to the back side of the met@@ ad@@ ata and the IP@@ TC data in the file . if you forget this , then you can save the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database in the files by clicking the menu in the menu album .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens you want to change ? s &amp; digi@@ ous , there is a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important .
now the real work begins , as you should select any photo passwords , you need to select all the pictures and then set the value . you will make sense at the top with the rating or the lea@@ derboard . this makes sense because you can concentrate on the best photos on the other .
let us take us with key@@ words , key@@ words , as you continue with other programs , are hot , or categories . all three are Syn@@ ony@@ me for the same thing .
if you want to add an alog@@ ist images from a different source , import them to the right place . the conversion of the Hier@@ archy within the building is no problem and can be done by means of a sub@@ tree to another sp@@ lit@@ ters ; the modified sample may be followed by &amp; digi@@ ous ; updates the lower trees .
the graphic shows as different met@@ ad@@ ata . this is a very rough representation of representation since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar features are characteristics of all pictures .
enough passwords - the next section refers to labelling or comments , the third important tool to cataly@@ ze your met@@ ad@@ ata .
you want to see most ni@@ ches your photos just see , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are interested in interested like your photos .
look at this panorama . from the distance of Fer@@ ne is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer and then start some details , people , who place the square .
and now I say you the site of the Lan@@ de@@ pot der Al@@ lied &amp; quot ; Oma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y , memories , the historical time period is again present , you may also hear the silence of this panoramic position , so your perception has been completely changed .
for other pictures , the title may be more important than the image to create a great interest . remember that key is the meaning of the viewing that the key is to help you about the motif which you want to understand what you understand .
it is in order if a picture is not perfect if the strength has only work with a label for themselves alone .
with &amp; delivery ; you can export a copy of any text in a internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , then you can export him to your wishes for your wishes and / or the title of Web Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . so you have to tell you a second time for the opening hours .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find any other city without navigation system ? it was not a long Planet from Go@@ og@@ le@@ Earth ? good , because with pictures , the train of the spatial presentation now already includes light speed .
you can take advantage of the options in the future . I am sure that you can repeat your journeys with ge@@ ographic data . you can also export the photos on the shooting location . you can also export the pictures and export them to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Go@@ og@@ le@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and referred the practice of copyright laws to remove limitations on the distribution and change of copies . the same liber@@ ties also apply to all modified versions , thus also for the work of other .
the following description tells you about information in the home page of &amp; digi@@ ous ; as information can be depos@@ ited as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for author and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organization can be used . if it did not have to be changed . this field does not need to be changed . this field does not support semi @-@ col@@ on as a separ@@ ator .
author &apos;s author ( syn@@ onymous with the author ) : together with the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples include a freelance photographer , freelance photographer or a kind of commercial photographer . since this is a link to the author , it must be filled this also .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for information ) : do not use the author for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then you can see the picture here . if the picture is a storage photo , then the group / agency offers the picture shows here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although it &apos;s no protection against abuse . each of them is a digital water@@ mark . for private persons , this protection is only very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and half @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique in the image . &amp; take delivery ; it is provided in the near future a such module for stack@@ ing processing .
topics : plate error , turn@@ out , power supply , ECC , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ vor@@ ce , life time , temperature , data size ,
of course , we talk about CDs that have lost here on the street or a fire . this kind of caps are also the same in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called Neue Medien .
c@@ roll On@@ track , the biggest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a loss .
in order to combat the problem with CD / DVDs , you can also hold more than a few years . of course , you can also hold the CDs and DVDs . there are also offers a gold @-@ coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 copies of a life time of 100 years for himself . if you believe that believe it is in your legs .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can use this risk in which you can do good discs and good recording devices . the best DVD movie devices are not much more expensive than the che@@ ap@@ est , but you can write a lot of reliable . it turns into the right choice .
CD and DVDs are very vulnerable to errors , even if you have just written a control mechanism to protect the rest we needed for the form@@ att@@ ing and control . despite this massive protective coating it needs through chemical Al@@ holder , ultra @-@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called for hardware and DVDs . it runs on Windows and &amp; Linux . however , there is no similar applications for damaged fixed disk disks , hard drives , Flash@@ media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to gain the HD DVD to win the HD DVD player . a dual @-@ player Blu @-@ ray disk can store up to 50 GB , and it was possible to use CDs and DVDs . all of course , the Blu @-@ ray disk can also be used for the Blu @-@ ray disk .
burn the data back to high quality media in one of the high quality media . read the data you want to check the media with a description , dark dry and dry conditions . do not forget the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest hardware or software which can read this media .
disk@@ manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer guarantees a new disk , but not the data . Google represents a big field study on the error of mechanisms of hard disks : disk error study
shortly , Dis@@ ks keep the most common bug in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The error code of the controller are not possible . some of S@@ MA@@ RT specified the error . these are in particular reading and publishing counter . the expected time period is between 4 and 5 years .
it is only about the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also protect the files due to a electricity if you decide to restore the files , but this losses can be used without great problems .
while most electrical devices can do not be much , the devices can be different from devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed devices . these can cause them to cause them to cause two wires , motherboards , motherboards and other defects . thus , in front of the inev@@ itable , which leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against current tips is a high voltage protection . this is a device that a part of the energy is absorbed and it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in . do not think that any plug @-@ in power is also available .
if you are looking for a high voltage protection , then you should pay attention to UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a specific minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protect the protection against ligh@@ tening strikes and thus protects the right connected devices .
as an over@@ voltage of any cable you can use it to your system , you should also be protected from your system . some manufacturers provide high voltage sc@@ anners , which also contain a telephone connection for your modem . other offer connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specifically designed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore very small and you are also included the protection for the modem . this means that you are ideal for road .
while a high @-@ voltage protection keeps your system in front of smaller wa@@ ver@@ ings in the power lines , it will not help you to increase the loss of unwanted data . so , it can be meaning@@ ful in an un@@ inter@@ rup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protection from over@@ ten@@ sions , these devices allow them to save up to the system . some models allow them to save your data and even further . if you need to use the same quality standards such as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the life time of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting .
concerns the potential risk to prevent your computer system . a high quality high voltage protection can be applied up to &amp; euros ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for you as well as your computer . at the end , you should remember to keep all cables to tr@@ enne before you go into the holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - an easy storage service . with the correct configuration , you can use this as a drive for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is another popular offer to store up data to any data .
they are very expensive in comparison to the hard drives are very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs $ 500 . in addition , you have to send the data on the compar@@ atively slow internet .
solutions are therefore only available as a solution against a local loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it &apos;s no general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com offers online storage services on photos . the professional variant offers you more in full resolution online in case of fli@@ ck@@ r more . for $ 25 a year you get un@@ limited memory , which should be checked in reality .
from point of view of the data backup , the web solutions are very safe . due to the TCP protocol automatically and with the large companies , it is included in the offer to backup and a partial memory .
the diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file systems and b@@ tr@@ fs make sure the data integrity between the operating system and hard drive .
the worst right is that no one doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s not a transmission error . it is quite surprising that there is no protection in your computer . no one seems to be thought to have no protection . the internet with its TCP protocol is a considerably more safe data away than the machine in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are a further source for transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data flows . in normal file systems these error remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently customi@@ zable for storage devices , you should look at the future . you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seem to be one of two candidates to be able to handle on low level and is available under an GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will be available for Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article on English .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is the same protective mechanisms of up the z@@ fs and is also available for &amp; Linux ; yet it is not part of the kernel .
do not estimate that these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in not@@ ebook and 46 % . in not@@ ebooks , the percentage of the@@ ft @-@ steels is 50 % .
the loss of viruses is less common than the chis@@ sts . it is currently being limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; none of them have been taken over a long time .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to loss of proprietary systems : wrong , NTFS , is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ s F@@ s , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the most common file systems . you find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems causes cor@@ rupt data and data : wrong , only the speed of the exam@@ ining process for a surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely stored before the problem was lost , she lost it .
viruses are the largest threat for digital data : false , the@@ ft and human errors are the main causes for loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 blu@@ etooth settings of fundamental physical limitations . however , the technology continued to develop a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go up in the direction of 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els@@ ens@@ res . even if this resolution is ideal for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ apixel cameras . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you will get a 750@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euros ; so you do not make your data often according to a plan and try to secure your data like the new installation of your operating system , replacement of records or the size of the hard drives .
supp@@ ose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , one day , a flash memory , you don &apos;t have any luck if the drive was not connected in the moment .
a des@@ aster proposes locally up and destroyed a lot . forgotten pilot : fire , water , electricity , children and the@@ ories are dangerous for your data . they usually need a whole room or the complete house .
therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ prev@@ entive always means a local store . bring your f@@ uses the steps up to the neighbour &apos;s house , in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a loss in spite of backup the p@@ anic . if you have a backup on the backup , then you can save the one day .
complete backup : a complete backup to all files are secured . we are a Mom@@ cil@@ man without history and represents a complete copy at one time .
differential services : secure the files that have been changed since the last complete safety devices . this creates a complete response image for two time points : the full @-@ scale protection and the latest differential protection .
searching for backup : back to the files which have been changed since the last backup . you can easily back up the original status at any time . this backup is coming to any time with the exception that there is only ab@@ get@@ ast@@ et with the exception that it is not possible .
rsync is a wonderful small tool which can be easily copied to your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP , such as the difference of files saved . this happens compressed if you would like to increase the safety of safety via ss@@ h .
secure important images directly after you have stored on your computer on a DVD or another op@@ tic medium .
this procedure can be done enough time to discover losses and back . at the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly working consumption for at least one month and a Mom@@ cil@@ o for each month . each additional function should be done manually after which you have a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , in image file saved IP@@ TC information , associated XMP files , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ lics of images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual equipment , ...
thus precious pictures the next 40 year survive , is about the period in which you are really interested , because they are interested in their childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be taken care of :
as the future due to your nature , you don &apos;t have to view it today . unfortunately , there is no other way to see them as a certain form@@ ality . however , all 5 @-@ 8 years should be in@@ compatible with the current system . each other variations are in the past , the more easier is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered using the explan@@ ations in this document . use and change to open standards which are supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , please keep it on and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : any time you change your computer architecture , your memory and ensuring technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert your library . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist printer for the possibility of change a system in its size . this means always enlarge .
go out of that you have planning a scal@@ ability with which you want to have a dedicated plate or partition , which you want to copy a dedicated plate or partition . * ni@@ x systems like &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and put it on a new plate :
check the command line , whether your new plate was detected by the system , but does it not depend on .
/ dev / S@@ DC / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / S@@ DC / S@@ DC / dev / S@@ DC / dev / S@@ DC / dev / S@@ DC / dev / S@@ DC / dev / S@@ DC / dev / S@@ DC / dev / S@@ DC / dev / S@@ DC .
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day is no software more , you can read this yourself . this task is easier by year to year .
GIF means a proprietary , patented format which appears slowly from the market . you should not use it anymore .
PNG is designed as an open source standard . it is possible to replace XMP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit rate of color and full transparency . PNG is needed and a slow compres@@ sive compression . this format would like to recommend you to store your pictures .
TI@@ FF was widely used as a picture format . TI@@ FF can be stored in a compressed form or in a container with some cameras you can store your images in this format . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The digital file format is a license @-@ free and open format format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG is based on TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to use of met@@ ad@@ ata . a handy camera system is now available and we hope to use the competitors from Canon and Nikon .
this may be a reason why the file is based on XMP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; the file &apos;s met@@ ad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information can be added to the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved the XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers withdraw it in front of your image file . but it is necessary to store the met@@ ad@@ ata separately between the met@@ ad@@ at@@ end@@ at@@ ei and the picture file . therefore , you should use the file format . therefore , you should use D@@ NG as a container and place it all there .
the Dublin Core Met@@ ad@@ ata Initiative is an open organisation that support a wide range of application and business models . the activities of the DC@@ MI has become a wide range of architecture and workshops , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and clari@@ fier efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or sc@@ anners . so long the pictures of the camera uses , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert video files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw material . this function is not implemented .
for a sensitive process , you can use external programs to external programs . if you want to add the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ tised , and then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata . these were cut by other programs .
protect the revised pictures for the copyright law with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in Web@@ gal@@ eries , do not use in MPEG , use &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; take . in the section I add a description on your hard disk . you can add the camera to you on your hard disk . but the camera interface offers you many advanced settings for imports of images to your Alb@@ end@@ ship bank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tised ; use the computer to display the camera on display mode and switch it on display . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it is possible to take a while at the bottom of the camera and the pictures of all photos are displayed . if this is the case , fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol of file association settings for each file , photos , movies , music etc . on the camera .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you may need to see the camera information about any entry . you can see the features and met@@ ad@@ ata in the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of a single order and met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialogue shows file properties and the camera information to be stored internally by the camera . an icon shows that the picture is not yet downloaded on your computer . please note that in some digital cameras are not available for all information .
the rider Met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as EX@@ IF , Manufactur@@ er , GPS etc. of the image . these information are the same as at the Met@@ ad@@ ata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ ous ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ ad@@ ata are not available at some digital cameras .
the easi@@ est way to download photos on your computer . download all photos of their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ tised . download the photos from their camera will be downloaded and we recommend to check whether the pictures can be downloaded in a album before you delete the photos from the camera .
you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only use the desired selection methods of &amp; K@@ DE ; as soon as you selected the photos can download and then download the button . the button is selected as long as you selected , until you selected some photos .
if your camera is supported , this option is now available to download . this images were not yet available until now . in this case you can choose the new pictures with a star in advance window . if you choose this option , you will only be downloaded only the new pictures .
if you want to download the buttons for download or download it , the list of the existing albums are displayed , displayed as a normal folder where you can read the list of folders using the list of folders . select the target album from the list and press you OK .
after you have selected the target album , press it OK , and digi@@ tised , and invites photos of the camera to the album .
once you can delete the desired photos , you can delete them by the camera . if you want to ext@@ ingu@@ ish the button . if you want to ext@@ ingu@@ ish the button , you &apos;ll need to ext@@ ingu@@ ish these files and delete them .
note that there are no possibility to delete the camera from the camera . you should check the photos already in the tr@@ ash@@ can . if you want to remove it from the camera . if you want to delete the camera system , you should do this over the camera system , because this is much faster .
cameras are often used as fil@@ en@@ ames for pictures are often used as fil@@ en@@ ames . this can be done to double fil@@ en@@ ames in the same album . therefore , it can be meaning@@ ful , the date and time to integrate the time in which the file is to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors of the image and for dat@@ as@@ p . if you use this latter option , automatically create a folder per day .
the options of the transfer will open three more options before the photos will be stored on the hard@@ cover section . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the EX@@ IF information into the IP@@ TC fields . the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
for example , if you want to use an additional data format as standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % -@@ % H : % M : % S . if you use the date &amp; time . for more customi@@ zations , you should read the help of the fil@@ ls .
if you use the option fil@@ en@@ ames , you have the option to modify the fil@@ en@@ ames in small book letters . or in large letters , if you prefer .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ tised ; for a photo is displayed below the name , the camera will be displayed at the preview . your settings are stored and automatically used when you open the camera to the camera window .
&amp; take delivery ; it can use all information about the orientation of the camera to play a automatic rotation during the download section . not all cameras put this information . in the section bar Met@@ ad@@ ata you can read more details about the information that lets you read your camera into the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually turned , and if your camera cannot supply this information , when you want to turn off the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn@@ table , you use the button over and choose the Automatic rotation in the lower part of the window .
if your camera made information about the date you can download and digi@@ tised the same time . all pictures with the same date will be loaded into the same time . all pictures with the same date will be loaded up . in the section bar Met@@ a data you can read , which may have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually connected , and it saves the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you need to use the button directly and select the option of data @-@ based flush at the bottom end of the window .
the easi@@ est way to upload photos from your computer on your camera is to download the file selection dialog . select the file selection dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; if you select the files you are uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods .
after the picture selection is done , it asks &amp; digi@@ tised ; it will be uploaded to the camera . select a folder dialog for the camera . select the files and press it OK to start the high load . the pictures are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is being used as a general term in this document which is indicated in length and it is displayed on a map . the determination of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian @-@ GLO@@ NAS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
not only for professional photography it can be interesting to connect an image with a precise ge@@ ographi@@ cally place . not everyone uses a plane to play an area via GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architectural office and real estate , can use this ability to use this ability .
if you have forgotten that , when the picture was done , you can send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ous ; if you want to specify a postcard , which can be found , or simply select these aspect documents , it &apos;s well the position results of a photos .
the question is how to get the GPS data in the picture ? first , you should know how the data is in this fields ? there are at least three ways to reach this way . directly with the correct hardware , about a follow @-@ up of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical assignment ( manual ) and most recently over the manual input of well @-@ known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera to run a GPS unit . but there &apos;s a few to work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmitting the data using a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Kodak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
the GPS data from one device can take place with g@@ ps@@ man or G@@ PS@@ Babel . you need to store this data in GP@@ X format , since this is the only format that is supported by the module for geographical assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract the data from pictures and of the GPS . at the following page you can check the same below &amp; Linux ; at the following page : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the length and latitude , or any data know , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs coordinates using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ go@@ ogle .
additionally no European road types . here are some European sides , at least on French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
digi@@ tised the behavior of your work processes as possible . there are many settings to take the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ tised ; in order to select the behaviour of the delivery ; the mounting dialog box is divided into eight pages . you can change between these changes by using the symbols on the left @-@ hand side .
select the action can be set at bed@@ time preview or image processing . they put the default behaviour of &amp; digi@@ tised ; thus , if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and detailed information dates . these data will be selected automatically in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields . also at a database synchron@@ isation these data will be written in the IP@@ TC fields .
author title is a syn@@ onym for the author : this box should have the professional code of the photographer . this case can be seen as a freelance photographer , freelance photographer or an independent , commercial photographer . because this is a further detailed description of the car box , this also must be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for information : do not use this field , if that for a news agency , such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be entered here . if the image is a bearing photo , then the group or the agency is one of the picture to be here .
the IP@@ TC promotions save the data in the respective IP@@ TC Fel@@ der@@ . thus , the met@@ ad@@ ata are permanently included in the image and can not only be found in the database of &amp; digi@@ ous . these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ tization .
pictures you want to save images as a embedded entry ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures , which can be read out to your photos . attention : in pictures that have already included charges these images were prescribed by the delivery of &amp; digi@@ ous .
the page settings includes all options for information , who appear , if the mouse @-@ mouse is stored in the main window over a file . depending upon chosen option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ous ; supports a number of different image formats and some audio formats . to indicate it , you can add the file exten@@ tion of this list ; and remove any file in one &amp; digi@@ ous ; Alb@@ um@@ ord@@ ner , who came to take delivery of these extensions .
the default settings can be reset again by using the knob on the right of each category .
the settings of the light@@ ness of &amp; digi@@ tised can be set on this page . however , some pictures have a different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available . if you use an option , you should only use on fast computing . if you have one , then you can get rid of this better results .
as standard , image processing has a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select this here . you can turn the tool bar , when you use image processing in full screen mode .
the image can be covered with dark@@ er and bright color in the picture . this colours can be set here . in image processing , this fitting can be connected with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling is meant that the pictures in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance is encoded as in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia at the immediate statement .
it would not reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the size of PNG and un@@ pack . if you have a fast machine , you can put this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 high compression .
using the TI@@ FF files you can comp@@ ress the default compression algorith@@ m for TI@@ FF pictures . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF pictures . it does not affect the image quality because the default algorith@@ m is free .
with the adjustment of loss@@ less JPEG @-@ 2000 files you can select the ratio between the loss of quality loss and file size far better than the normal JPEG . however , met@@ ad@@ ata was not supported , but was not supported during the planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ ous , the image processing was only a picture frame for photos . currently , it was developed very quickly to use a tool to manipulation of your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of image processing .
the default value is that all the green pixels of the CCD @-@ sensor can react to bright light . if you use this option to make this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option features a little soft , elimin@@ ating the 2x@@ 2 pattern pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance sheet is used on the camera . otherwise , when the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not reset . standard is a fixed colour balance , which was photographed on a white card built in the sun light .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that in four steps more details can be ignored , in four steps more details are ignored . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
the standard is clear , so the parts of your images can be found in white , due to the ability to view the ability to view the top of your camera . in various ros@@ at@@ ö@@ es , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top @-@ lights .
this is possible because blue pixels in general is not as fast as green and red . I try to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a matter how much color or white you want .
if you select the option , you get the option to set a level . here &apos;s a value of three is a compromise , and can therefore be adapted to every image .
set the L@@ umin@@ ous value to your taste . you probably need to set him somewhat higher than the standard 1 . this may also be done in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing is too small . in order to keep the time for Dem@@ os@@ a@@ ic@@ ing small , you should be conservative .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ ic@@ ing algorith@@ m is a digital image process , which is used by color fil@@ tered image sensor that have many cameras and have a matrix color pixel . this algorith@@ m is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ wery .
I used the quality algorith@@ m for me : bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ ft ) used for me . it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting , if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable performance .
if you know the colour deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a colour@@ less correction , as you will be carried out during the rough conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions as these again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ tization ; information like the color information from one colour space in the others are so precise as possible as possible .
behavior , if a picture is open in image processing is open / color circuit module with raw files .
colour profile folder allows you to save the folders , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &amp; take delivery ; this folder is then stored during the Star@@ ts .
settings the ICC @-@ profiles have here the possibility to go &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles , everything you can change the shell file later .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here , only your pictures have not been administered by the entire screen .
the input profiles should be done for the camera control and model you can use . not all profiles are included in the same way . however , some cra@@ ps are not corrected . this means that you do not have to carry out the color force at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the colour version .
there are other options such as the soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , which you can print how your printer can print a smaller color range , so your printer can use a smaller color range , so you can use them manually or leave the algorith@@ m of your printer .
for most cameras , it is fairly obvious that color profile is suitable for them . unfortunately not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles together . this answer is of course un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension can be seen the style for the purpose : F for a natural style , L for neutr@@ ality , N for Neut@@ ral , P for Portra@@ its and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; image Plu@@ gin interface . it is an interface that can be digi@@ tised by a number of &amp; K@@ DE ; image quality and images . many modules support which are written to work with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution is installed at the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you would like to use a list of the available modules . select this modules appear as a new entries in the menu of the main window and beyond , you will find some also in the context menu of the pre @-@ text menu .
short warran@@ ts for tasks that are carried out by modules , can be set up in the menu under the course of settings .
additional information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules can be accessed via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ in .org or in the mobile books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the Di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper regulator , normally about 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other stops on the met@@ ad@@ ata are the met@@ ad@@ ata , which ends at the bottom end of the pictures during the display .
the camera properties show a list of all cameras supported cameras on the left hand side . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , enabled the port settings . currently , the port settings are required , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire storage storage are supported .
at the bottom of the bottom you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ wire ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) . you need to have a USB@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from camera . you &apos;ll need to set the path / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / or you need to mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tised ; you need to connect the camera with your computer to display them into the display mode .
pro@@ bi@@ ere you come to whether &amp; take delivery ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set Camera dell and Port manually . after you set your camera , your camera appears in the menu camera .
you can select any any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu of the main window . if you own more than a camera , you can add all of them here .
with the option dialog for the displacement of &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ can . you can read the talk of &amp; digi@@ ous ; the del@@ eting of a photos in the album can be set . in the sections of a photos and del@@ eting of an album .
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be shut down through &amp; digi@@ tised ; if you use the option to use the right side bar without residue . otherwise you have to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also connect the display of the screen saver of &amp; digi@@ ous ; in case of sub@@ types , this accelerates the start process of &amp; digi@@ tization .
setting the setting up to new photos are looked after a new photos . take the basic period following new or deleted albums by the base . if something out of the basic ch@@ ord was deleted , it asks &amp; digi@@ ous ; it should be ext@@ ingu@@ ished , whether it should delete them from the database .
different colour schem@@ atic can be used in &amp; digi@@ ous ; in order to adjust the main window to your taste . this settings can select the tool from the tool bar . a preview of the available design is below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in a new design for &amp; digi@@ ous ; you will find additional information about this tut@@ orial .
you can use this image processing with some basic tools . you can use this in order to watch your photos and for correction . the image processing can be started through a click with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selecting the agreement : / editing .
the image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available in &amp; digi@@ tization . so , they are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules you can see in section image processing .
a status bar at the bottom edge of the feeding , the fil@@ en@@ ame names , current file names , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size shows .
a menu bar at the upper edge and among them the tool bar for fast access to the most common functions .
the machining functions of image processing will change your photos . do not have the original photo , but before you use file storage or the knob from the tool bar . note that you can &apos;t use the original photo , once you have the picture stored .
you should therefore be able to produce a copy of your image , before you change it . this allows you to do with file memory .
as long as you don &apos;t have the picture back , you can use the original image for images or the button of the image processing in the tool bar . if you lose any change that you have done on the picture since the last memory .
almost any action of image processing can be done and restored and restored . the last action can be re@@ adily accessible by using editing , editing , and restore from the menu .
if you are using this often , you should make the keyboard shortened , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to the backward and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z for re @-@ open .
if you choose the &amp; L@@ MB in the tool bar at the same time you can press a text @-@ button , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu applications , all the actions will also be restored and restored .
once you &apos;ve got the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool bar , image more , picture r@@ under or the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes at the current picture you will be asked if you want to back up .
you can take in the photo and out into the C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse bike or the symbols in the tool bar or the entries in the box menu .
to match a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool bar : the magni@@ fication factor is automatically choose
view full screen mode is displayed in full screen mode . if you don &apos;t want to enter the bar codes . if you don &apos;t want to take this on the site dialog . you can view it from the &amp; digi@@ ous ; main window will be retri@@ eve . see it the section to set the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select the image file and get the default &amp; K@@ DE ; print dialog . you can customi@@ ze your picture here , before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole sets . whole images can choose from your selection . you need to select images with the standard methods , select print assistant . if you follow the assistance , you need only need your choice .
the main window came to the right side ; the main window has a side bar at the right edge , which is provided important information and promotions for the selected images . the same side is available , without the navigation system parts , also available in image processing . it will be displayed if one of the five riders are available :
multiple extensions on the same rider the side bar will appear and disappear again in the edge disappear .
in the labelling unit , you can add the note below . the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed to copy all special characters are stored in the EX@@ IF@@ - und IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data supports only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut down , and special characters are formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling unit in other applications , you should note this limitations .
after you may use it , you can either use the button application or change simply to the next image , which then saved restrictions .
besides the application button , there is a button . you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata in the selected file or database . you can also write the met@@ ad@@ ata to the files . this is always done when you choose a met@@ ad@@ ata setting , always written in the pictures .
the section evaluation shows an evaluation system from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searching for a single click on the back side . in order to evaluate several pictures at the same time . in order to evaluate several images simultaneously , select this text @-@ text menu .
the evaluation will be written into the IP@@ TC field of the IP@@ TC field . the encoding follows the diagram in the following table :
the key@@ note shows a sear@@ ch@@ box to fil@@ tering the key@@ words , the key@@ word and a com@@ bo box with the previously published in this &amp; digi@@ p@@ box ; session of the key@@ note .
the key@@ word is dynami@@ cally adapted to the specified search password . you can choose the number of possibilities for a key@@ word quickly . this capability is particularly useful if you have many key@@ words .
the input field at the bottom end is a further relief in the input of key@@ words on a picture series . if you have different key@@ words , these are stored for quick access .
key@@ words can also be set by marking of the appropriate check@@ box in the tree . all key@@ words of an image will be stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if several pictures are chosen in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , If you choose a selection with a key@@ word , If you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter .
the side bar filter is used to modify the selection of the option on their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , key@@ note and sear@@ ches . if there is also one or more key@@ word filter from the right side , only the cutting quantity of these two will be displayed . all created words are available .
you can also retri@@ eve key@@ words in the main view . if the key@@ word is already exists , you can easily draw from the right side bar and put on the selection . thus , a dialog box , which you ask , whether you want to set the key@@ word .
in the upper example the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . they were selected by Str@@ g + a , and then a key@@ word from the right key@@ word is pulled to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks for whether this key@@ word is to be set .
this search for changes will take place in each start of the program . you can also be connected under the settings .
if you have a rule and created and discover that there is a or be , you can easily connect this with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is sought . this may be a album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is an name or a string chain which is already set in the database .
you can set up an extensive selection of all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to set out options , you need only use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button to use the button as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r do not listed ? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution .
this article / Tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly adapted to &amp; digi@@ ous ; s increased implementation .
the reason why you have a color management workflow , which allows the colours of your camera or sc@@ anned sc@@ anned colors . with color management , you can reach the colors on your monitor with your camera or sc@@ anners , and the colours are able to print on your monitor or in the web , from your digital dark @-@ chamber .
if the theme is on color authority , then everyone knows that buttons would like to provide you to any point of image processing work@@ flows . additionally , the meaning of this tut@@ orial gives you enough background information about color administration . additionally , you will find any links with lower information , make your own account you informed the required earnings .
if your image workflow is fulfilled all six below criteria , then you have to take care of color administration .
you are working on a monitor which is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour space . ( more information you will find below )
your only other image editions are by email or the Web , where s@@ RGB the de @-@ facto standard is used .
if so s@@ RGB works well and the life for all so simple , why should I use one more color gam@@ ut in order to make sure about paint jobs ?
an visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colours which we can see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ asts @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colour space , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms and then click on info and then on information about RGB working spaces .
do I need my monitor to install my monitor when I decided to work in s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you work with RGB color gam@@ ers or not you need to make your monitor with your monitor . if you work as a colour space of s@@ RGB , then you have to use either your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard k@@ alli@@ zing , a matching monitors or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve the image in most cases . do not use it before you try to try a more stringent manual process .
the functions norm@@ alize , ab@@ normal , automatic set@@ ups and contrast from the menu corrected the Automatic Setup will automatically try to make the best of your colors . you will need to experiment with these effects , which acts on your photo at your photo .
norm@@ alize this method determin@@ es the light values about the whole image , allowing the dark @-@ point black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible without its paint sh@@ ear . this function is often a magic correction for pictures the dark or washed .
the same method : this method is the same number of pixels in the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the double image can be produced as low as possible . it &apos;s just a powerful operation , it &apos;s a very powerful operation , which causes either a mi@@ racle , or destroyed it .
automatic exact : this method is maxi@@ mi@@ zes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . they are determined by the dark and light limit shades and adjustable the red , green and blue channels to the entire hist@@ ogra@@ mm@@ area .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and the illumination of the RGB values of an image by one of the lowest and highest values on the greatest possible area and a new ji@@ set of all values in between . this is only visible in visible images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ tization ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the white equal to a photos .
the white @-@ equal correction is slightly restricted as one colour space with 8 bits per color . if you can perform the white per@@ imeter from the original image . if you can perform white in the shell mode , which is in 16 @-@ bit mode , you will have better opportunities for correction better .
this tool is based on a white balance measure and is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . it is started using the menu entry colors white and image processing .
the window can be adjusted in size . on the left @-@ hand side the picture is adapted to the picture and the preview of the target . if you want to see the original file , if you want to see the original box , then you can click on the window onto the window .
the preview of the target photos features a red marker . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the pixels under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right above is a hist@@ ogram , as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very useful because most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ ous values . with one button , you can decide whether one of the three colours or your sum will be displayed . the sum will be called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on the shade , saturation , and gamma . the shade Jus@@ tin lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or even down di@@ ms .
if you use the above controls , you should use the colour temperature Pi@@ p@@ ette instead of this button , and you can use the colour temperature for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of the white colour . this species will also be set automatically the temperature and green values .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of the default settings . the following settings are available :
the exposure indicator increases the colors if more than a color channel of the pixels is over@@ charged . you will see the combined earnings in white image . this is displayed in the preview as pure indicator and does not appear on the final image .
the buttons Save as well as charging make this . any setting of white balance can be set up and you can save this in a text file and later .
the knob contains all filter values again on their standard values and the respective neutral white balance . note that also in neutral settings like your original settings . if you want to set the original image , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the coding depth of the color channel . 8 @-@ bit coding is better suitable for high @-@ quality images . this coding is also needed for high quality images , but also stands for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialogue as the processing of raw images . it uses the modification and instruction of colour profiles . color ton@@ ic can be carried out by the window for the hel@@ lig@@ ently . a detailed guidance for the use of colour profiles , you can withdraw the chapter colour management .
another important tool can be found in the menu under colors . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always be able to do the same correction and you will always require the same correction . you can find additional information for your audio correction .
a very powerful way of exposure to the gra@@ dation is that you find in colors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; the Far@@ be@@ ff@@ ness is presenting four colour effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via @-@ Filter , a Ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
at times of the chemical processing , Solar@@ mi@@ er was a effect of the picture above the light , dark@@ er areas , and the colours were inver@@ ted through the second lighting . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust both this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar control . at approx . 50 % intensity the image shows what is very che@@ mically possible . another increase is finally a negative image , so it is not possible on photo paper .
this is a example of the solar system effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the coefficient of visual intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it distinguishes itself from a saturation that it makes a stronger contrast , the colours and gl@@ are . try it easy to use it more beautiful pictures .
Vel@@ via is the name of a brand @-@ filled color film by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via is very saturated color in daylight and high contra@@ sts . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colours are very saturated color , but also some photographs , especially of which are hardly any kind of landscapes .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the parameters level controls the brightness of the results and the sliding repe@@ ti@@ tions . in large pictures the filter can reach the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to view the different colour rate of your photographs with the tools in the menu . for all your alignment . as soon as you are satisfied with the results , you are using the button O@@ k and you are applied .
if you want to reduce the problem with poor lighting conditions . in this case you can reduce the tool for brightness / saturation . all changes you can look at the preview . if him , the result you can see the changes using O@@ k .
the tool gra@@ dation between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ ase / contrast / Gamma is the tool to improve exposure . even if the dialog in this tool is complicated , need for use in the field of sli@@ der sli@@ der . concrete sli@@ der is below the hist@@ ogra@@ mm@@ s .
the windows contains a graphite output values , a hist@@ ogram , the active edge , or the selected unit . in order to modify the intensity values of the image , and in order to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright side .
the easi@@ est way to learn the operation , it is the knob there and then to pay attention , how does the picture changes .
on the right side , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynami@@ cally updated , based on the settings of the image . on the left @-@ hand side the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this select box can be set if the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y @-@ axis is often dominated . in pictures , the linear hist@@ ogram of a single column are dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is useful .
three regul@@ ators : the top for the dark shades , the middle for the bright shades and the under@@ side notes as well as gam@@ er values .
the three col@@ ol@@ p@@ ettes can be used in the preview of the original text , in order to adjust the input , the shade , middle and bright shades are automatically enabled . in addition , there is a button for an automatic alignment .
values : the check values allow you to change a selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ating values to be used in the input rate . for example , the compression values can be used for e.g. to create a completely light picture as the background to see anything else in the background .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set automatically depending on the intensity values of the image .
store as and loading : with these buttons , the embedded values can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later again . Gim@@ p levels format is used .
when you use this mode and the three paint spray systems will be able to use automatically for all the shade , means and Sundays . if you want to use this mode and click on the preview of the original version of the hist@@ ogra@@ mm@@ s for red , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ ous channels .
the option for the trans@@ formers will be controlled by all colour channels to find out pixels in order to give you the combined output of all channels . here is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final results .
below you see an example for the alignment of the input using red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the values are unchanged . the original image is identified with ( 1 ) and correct picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left @-@ hand side , half of the origin@@ als and the target picture is displayed . the preview is dynami@@ cally updated depending on your settings . on the right @-@ hand side the following options are available :
modifications channel : this select box allows the channel to specify the channel to be changed from the module :
in addition to this cheese , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ ari@@ th@@ eses . most of the linear mode is the most popular mode . for pictures with large areas of a constant colour , the linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps increase .
for example , if you turn right , e.g. the bright notes , e.g. the bright shades , then you can see that these bright sounds can be done with dark@@ er expression and that the associated frame pixels can be dark@@ er .
on the preview of the original photos is a red way@@ mark . if you want to change this marking the curve on the curve , which represents the original value . create a point on this line and move the spot on this line and then move the value to your taste .
save as and loading : with these buttons , you can make this . each curve you can store this file system and then saved it later . the file format is the Gim@@ p spa format .
if you want to create this method for all channels of the shadow , medium and sun lines . keep the colour pi@@ p@@ ette which you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ ous curve .
the option for the trans@@ formers will show all the color channels to show high @-@ capacity pixels . if in more than a channel , you get the combined result . here is a indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final results .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo , which was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ous channel . shadow of sun@@ shades and the curve was applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and this corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mix@@ ers of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or to change the color sh@@ aded of the photos .
the channel mix@@ ers is a further highly developed tool to mix the color shades of the images . you can process it from the colors channel mixer and image processing .
using the channel command box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint as you want to view the relative distribution and view . the left @-@ range of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed by comparison to their own riders .
the preview of the target chart features a red marker . if you have a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram in order to show you the corresponding color value .
controls the right side down : control for red , green and construction allow you to keep the respective temperature of this option , because the channel mixer will enable you to produce great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , particularly if you encounter Mon@@ och@@ rome , which is not able to occur at the same place in the color channel and their noise pattern is different in each channel . if the case you can use your Mon@@ och@@ rome conversion in which you need to reduce the color in the color .
storing and store buttons are used exactly to this purposes . any of any mix@@ ers , you can store for later and then load . the file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option for the trans@@ formers will be controlled by all colour channels to find out pixels in order to give you the combined output of all channels . here is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final results .
below you can see a photo in the blue channel . the option is enabled . the original image is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the image was shown below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstract certificate . with the development of digital photography is black / white , a work step , since color pictures can easily be converted on the computer . also with a set of film roller sheets .

green filter : simul@@ ated a black / white fil@@ tering with a green lens filter . this looks good from all the scene images and paired especially well to portrait against the sky . thus similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange pe@@ el : simul@@ ated a black / white fil@@ tering with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . thus similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ tes filter .
ro@@ filter : simul@@ ated a black / white fil@@ tering with a red lin@@ k@@ filter . this is influenced by the rich @-@ rich effects and can simul@@ ate moon over the day time . thus , like the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filters : simul@@ ated a black / white fil@@ tering with a yellow Left filter . this is the most important colour correction and the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : this is a warm bright and medium sounds , while a bit cold in the sh@@ ear time . this is typical for the process of your grand@@ mother and that is similar to the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool texture , you can use decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
by adding a texture on your image , regardless of it is a color screen , or you can look like an oil painting , a pop art portrait of increased points or like a wall image on a wall . the menu entry can be used by image processing .
relief : left this parameter to the right increases the inc@@ ision of the depth and three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper text is applied on the picture below . the original image is on the picture below ( 1 ) and changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief is on 200 .
add a decorative frame with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; the frame is made of a decorative frame in order to be added .
the eye of a viewer in the borders of a photos is not easy to keep the image . this is a psychological barrier to set the image . this is a psychological barrier to take place . under the frame , the module can be started out of image processing .
type : with this parameter you can put the desired cut@@ aneous type for your image . with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , it is also possible to add a nice three @-@ dimensional frame for a bar@@ op@@ fe@@ ed@@ ect and decoration , add a ornamental frame with patterns .
width : gives the width of the frame in percent . the range of width is 1 % to 50 % .
together with the frame , it is bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio of the aspect ratio . this is important for the pressure of images , especially when you use the tool to an aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can add simple to form@@ att@@ ed text into a picture on any place . this goes also to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive . specify the text of the image size and set it with the mouse . you &apos;ll need to adjust the character set to the image , the bigger must be the character set . at the end , select a frame with the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
each setting which you have chosen for your text , can be changed to the button . once the image is stored once , the text is part of the image . he cannot be changed .
using the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool templates , you can connect a template for a picture .
the menu picture template in image processing can be used to convert template for a picture .
for the template there is no restrictions on the size and the orientation . if you want to add the need of your templates ( 9 ) if you need to add an e @-@ mail to the &amp; digi@@ tised file , send an e @-@ mail to the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ dal e @-@ mail : mail@@ ing list digi@@ tised to @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for you , you need to use your templates with the button base in the dialog . select the folder where you have the template messages . this settings will be noticed for the next start .
after the root ord@@ ner has been set out for the template &apos;s templates , the order structure of the template structure is reflected . the selection of a party updates the template bar .
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlarged the same image . in order to check the position of mouse buttons . check it with the left mouse button .
reduced dimensions : this button is reduced to the surrounding image . if you want to use the mouse buttons . if you want to use the mouse click on the entire picture , you must check the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
follow this button : use this button to move the picture under the template picture . take the picture and place it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to use the template on your image . the image is then adapted to the pre@@ amp size .
&amp; digi@@ came ; With three different tool to sharp@@ ness . each of you are different from all of you in other areas .
shar@@ pen is a traditional tool to sharp@@ ness . it is very fast and easy , but it is especially in dark fields , liqu@@ eurs pictures .
Un@@ acuity Mas@@ ke works in the contrast of the edges . indeed , it &apos;s no bit to remove it , but it &apos;s a really good job . the algorith@@ m was taken out of Gim@@ p and he is protected by Win@@ ston Chang .
here is the best of the three , because he really improved the sharp@@ ness . it is a little complicated in its application and has different parameters to adap@@ ting .
pictures without focus as well as most digi@@ tised pictures need to be summ@@ arized as a common color . this is the same phenomenon occurs when colour points can be printed on paper . SLR cameras normally need more subsequently sharp@@ ening as a normal cameras for the private application .
at JPEG pictures , there is often a camera &apos;s internal sharp@@ ening . images in the raw format must always be drilled during the processing .
some sc@@ anners with a sharp@@ est already during the image of the image . if you need this de@@ activate , you get the control over your image .
in some situations , you can get a photo taken by using a photo with the sharp@@ ening support . that allows you to make sharp@@ ening with the menu entry .
you should give this , however , because the results increases the sharp@@ ness . however , the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness . in general , the most needed technique is to deal with the tool . you can find more information about the menu entry . below re@@ focus , you will find additional information and a comparison of all techniques .
sometimes , you have the correct problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution can record a little bit as it . use the tool to the menu entry and experim@@ enting something with the menu entry . the window on the right side of the dialogue is showing you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ ri@@ j@@ unk is a very good tool to remove Schlei@@ er from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview can help the picture . the front panel shows the copy of the fil@@ tering with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values are often made good results , and should strengthen the effect . if you try the in@@ filtr@@ ing meas@@ les to strongly make the noise and the impression of Greenland in the vicinity of sharp edges .
the radius is how many pixels on each side are affected by the filter . high resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore be able to cut the best in its final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between original and the ver@@ wis@@ s picture is one of the original . this is the strength of the sharp@@ ness .
the swelling value is a split from the maximum RGB value and the input difference . one can define a minimum difference between the tones of filter and therefore it is avoided by a soft switch between the ast@@ ness of the tough@@ ness and therefore beauty errors were avoided .
this is an example of un@@ sharp filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the picture was used ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp cut with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool @-@ focusing on a picture through improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright holder of the copyright filters -@@ algorith@@ m by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to deliver a picture as a result . this is a better way to focus on how to use a technique called F@@ IR Viennese film . a focus reaches better results than un@@ sharp counter@@ s . you can call it out of the menu by using colors Re@@ focused on images .
in practice , the circular saw have a very long tail , which leads far from the original envelope , depending on the original envelope , the F@@ IR Vienna In@@ verse of the pal@@ ate is influenced by the most cases even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular saw . it is the most important parameter for use of this module . most of the default value should make 1 good results . you can pay a higher value if your image should be very un@@ sharp , but then we pay attention on Hei@@ ligen@@ certificates .
correlation : reflecting the correlation between 0 @-@ 1 and the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . the correlation is 0.5 and the values are close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation is reduced with the tough@@ ness effect of the module .
smo@@ ky filter is possible to help arti@@ facts . however , the filter can be reduced values of 0 @-@ 1 . however , the filter is very poor . if the smo@@ ky filter is very poor . a needed value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value is still needed , the picture is even further forced .
pal@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . this parameter is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value , you may also need to increase the correlation between the correlation and / or filter .
Mat@@ ri@@ zen@@ &apos;s size : this value can produce good results , particularly if you select great values for the circuit @-@ shaped ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos; . however , the module is very slow when you select great values for this parameter . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
storing and store buttons are used exactly to this purposes . any of any real time parameters can be set up and then saved for later .
try all feeder , color and intensity correction on the picture before you use the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture before you change the picture . the reason for this is that plenty of operations , changes are not visible , but the however later un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
when you read pictures and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should use the module to the un@@ compressed picture .
generally , contrast , contrast , better results as sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by contrast , the un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ as@@ signs a bigger neighborhood was used as sharp@@ ening .
theore@@ tically , impossible , do not show the effect of visual acuity . even under optimum conditions it is possible that the results of the F@@ IR Vienna can always be at least as well as the in@@ visual acuity . the F@@ IR Viennese filter is often more often with the machining of small details .
below you can see a comparison of the different fil@@ tering , shown on a small un@@ focused picture :
the original un@@ sharp colour image has to be corrected . this image was made using a analogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus .
for more information about methods to obtain sharp@@ est in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the controller G@@ lä@@ tte continues to produce the diss@@ em@@ ination of the area of dark@@ ened in order to generate an over@@ lich@@ ter P@@ up@@ ille .
paint the colour allows the adapted paint for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want to adjust blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set this here .
the mould of image error correction is one of the most widely developed tool to remove any desired Art@@ ef@@ acts with un@@ parall@@ ely speed .
the algorith@@ m was developed by IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different def@@ aul@@ ts as starter points for the restoration of the restoration . the available barrier are below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings to a adjustable settings , you can use the rider speaker and advanced settings .
detailed respect , p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this is a small value to be found on the picture . a value of 0.9 should be more detailed and details . a value of 0.9 should be needed , so no sharp@@ ness is needed . please note the details of the details and if necessary .
pre@@ stres@@ ses on the Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value , even in one direction there . if you have a film length or CCD @-@ ins , a high value of the similar pattern is used . JPEG arti@@ facts are being used on top of a value near 1 .
smooth@@ ed &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum load factor above all@@ os@@ p . then the relative gain is defined . put this value to the degrees of the room in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . this is necessary if it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ bul@@ lets you need to be higher than 3 .
repe@@ ti@@ tions : are often run on how often of algorith@@ m is usually 1 or 2 .
angle ti@@ pping da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ en Alpha . if alpha is chosen , you should choose that small angle will generate a long term running . you should choose this value so the maximum possible and choose for your needs .
integr@@ al stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integr@@ al stri@@ de length in pixel . you should put the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel delay and never larger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : thanks to the quality you get to the option of this option is low , but the running time . we recommend it to allow him to allow him .
the buttons Save as well as charging make this . any setting of image errors can be saved and saved in a text file .
image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it may last very long and take a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation using the knob .
below you can see how image error with small art@@ ef@@ acts are applied . the module is used on a photo , used in Guatemala City . as you see there is a bad film position during the journey . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and corrected the image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; noise is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses an ancient protected algorith@@ m of Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool is provided with selectable image filter to remove st@@ ains and different art@@ ef@@ acts that can be removed from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor from the camera or mo@@ re@@ als ; effects of inj@@ ectors from books and magazines can be removed too .
if you need more information about sensor rau@@ ters from digital cameras , you can read this on English in this tut@@ orial .
the photo of the photo above shows a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a liqu@@ eurs that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you will only need the lower window and the flush advanced settings can stay in the default settings .
radius will take the filter size , 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is needed for filter . the image is necessary for the filter . by the radius , the image specified by the radius and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and therefore smaller errors .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ est distance . this value increases the edges of the filter . if it is increased , the edges must change the edges . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image data can &apos;t get more and smo@@ othing or lubric@@ ating it again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response to the noise . if it &apos;s not able to reach the noise , if you want to remove it on a value near to the maximum , if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG arti@@ facts .
light density : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or light density to improve the image . this settings does not affect the gain process that will be controlled by details -@@ settings .
color : controls the colour toler@@ ance of the image . we recommend either color or light density to improve the image . this settings does not affect the gain process that will be controlled by details -@@ settings .
gamma : controls the gamma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance limits of the dark@@ er areas , which typically have a stronger increase . however , the shadow areas are lubric@@ ated .
damp@@ ing : controls the alignment system radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased when it is too high , the edges can occur at its minimum , noise and phase shift on the edges . it can remove the noise , and is the recommended method for it .
save and store : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for the smoke @-@ cri@@ es which you have set , can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later .
this is an example of how smo@@ ked your life could change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and correct with ( 2 ) . the room has been applied with standard settings .
sometimes it is a painting for your purpose . the solution that allows the picture to draw a little bit as a picture . use the menu entry to the menu entry and experim@@ enting with the G@@ lä@@ tte . the window on the right side of the dialogue is indicating the effect of this operation .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools in photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter allows you to remove the possibility of un@@ desirable Art@@ ef@@ acts of your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ls , original or subsequently digi@@ tised images in digital , original or subsequently digi@@ tised images . the smooth@@ ness is done along the images and receives the contents as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorith@@ m can be used for color and tex@@ tured using any other tool . the algorith@@ m was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ rich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG arti@@ facts : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even far away . as an loss@@ less compression algorith@@ m he produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards in un@@ compressed picture . this setting is to correct these problems .
the buttons Save as well as charging make this . any setting of photo restoration , this is stored in a text file and later will be loaded later .
photo rest@@ or@@ ration is relatively very fast at work . however , it may last very long and take a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation in any time with the knob .
below you can see how a photo is applied to a black and white photo . the module is applied to a black and white photo with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film trans@@ verse to the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and corrected under ( 2 ) .
below , you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time Tex@@ tures was applied to an old color photo , which was used by the scan lighting and the photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and corrected the image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Tools Hot@@ pixel has been allowed to remove it pixels of photos which were removed with a CCD camera , eight were removed from the JP@@ EG@@ pixel project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , tot@@ e or hot pixels are particularly in high @-@ quality raw mode pictures , because many cameras come with JPEG compression via a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photograph with a dark @-@ to @-@ extraction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file in the assist@@ ants with the knob . the tool is recogni@@ zable from the hot and light pixels . these are shown in the exhibition show .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can discover the dark @-@ screen directly in the connection to create new hot or bright pixels because of CCD Def@@ ects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should find the appropriate component of the dark . a automatic processing of dark cheap will be found . please note that the assistant to the last dark and this automatically re@@ charges in the next meeting .
the image area and the preview can help you within the image . the window shows the output of the fil@@ tering with the current settings . poor pixels is available in all pre @-@ areas areas .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and results of the fil@@ tering . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing these pixels blocks . these are the available filter available :
Dur@@ cut : there is an average of the neighbour pixels . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels which have a distance of 1 from pixel block , to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ed the def@@ ective pixels in block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to a pixel block is drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels in block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less , are produced to calculate a bi @-@ Cuban surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cuban curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) and then used to inter@@ pol@@ ed the def@@ ective pixels in block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct picture is shown below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Vig@@ net@@ atic correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net , i.e. , at a image .
wide angle lens , especially in the medium and large display sizes , can often burn the edges and edges of the image , by making the light that the sensor can reach the sensor there . tel@@ e@@ obj@@ ectively can also show this behavior .
but he also has dis@@ advantages . many centre filter require a factor of 1.5 or 2 with a flash filter , which is impossible to keep the camera by hand . wide angle objective is to use center with center filter , a opening of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise im@@ pe@@ eling effects arise .
with great exposure ranges of today &apos;s film and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a stock of digital cameras , this is possible to simul@@ ate the transformation with a Center@@ filter . the tool is protected by John Walker . the algorith@@ m is protected by John Walker .
using three shelves , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ atic correction filter and with three additional exposure to the target .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light @-@ level loss . the standard density is 2.0 , which is random@@ ly compens@@ ated with a flash point of 2 , or random@@ ly compens@@ ating the density by a larger degree of vi@@ ability , reduce it to compensate for a small degree .
leu@@ ch@@ ase , contrast and gamma settings : the image of an image with the Vig@@ net@@ atic correction reduces the level of image with this options . you need to adjust the options to adjust only positive values , as you need to increase the settings .
if you want to adjust the fin@@ eness of the target , you can set the values for illumination / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ spirits correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the correct picture in the edges and ( 2 ) corrected the image . a leu@@ ke@@ mia and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Lin@@ sen@@ sus , is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses in photos . it uses an ancient protected algorith@@ m of David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ rical distor@@ tions . color@@ ings can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second gradient is treated with the general geomet@@ ric acid and can correct the con@@ ave of the image .
the coefficient of the third Gra@@ des has a similar circular effect , fla@@ x but on the edges . this correction is not supported in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth Gra@@ des corrected the remote corners of the remote corners . if you combine these two combine , any geomet@@ ric distortion can be eliminated almost eliminated .
general : this value will be corrected the strength of the gra@@ fts from the second Gra@@ des . with negative values can be corrected and reduced the positive values to be carried out .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion . this value is stronger than in the centre of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter set the parameter from the parameter General .
zoom : this value is re@@ iter@@ ated the image size and thus leads a correction of the first gra@@ ding by . negative values improve during positive the image .
brigh@@ ter : this value increases the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduced the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values are increased .
to help you to find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialogue with a preview the locking correction . values for your image are stored and stored in the next start as standard values .
the clay / k@@ ci@@ ence correction should be carried out in front of all feed or size changes . if you have a picture , cut a picture , and then a ton@@ ight correction would be the effect of the Fal@@ sche .
to give you the best correction , this tool will show you a vertical and a horizontal support line . move the mouse button to fix the lines at this place . in the connection , you can correct the tone - / k@@ ci@@ ence of distortion with the help of the lines .
if you have a k@@ ci@@ ence of distortion , the resulting image black corners will have . you can remove this with the cutting @-@ cutting machine in the menu , remove the image processing or remove the zoom controller in this dialogue .
for most photos are the ton@@ ight @-@ shaped correction . the next logical step for some motifs , e.g. photos from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective so that if you have the camera by hand , you will always keep the camera by hand .
this is an example of the ton@@ ight @-@ shaped correction for a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorith@@ m is based on an simul@@ ating infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u.@@ org website under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ ra film , see this URL . this film has a range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
on the left side of the window , you can select the area for the preview . if you see the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can simul@@ ate two parameters of film trays and film sensitivity . the ISO regulator changed the amount of film vision and the Domin@@ ic@@ ity of the colour green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green meadows is white like snow !
because the filter colour channels were inter@@ red to produce inf@@ ra film , especially the green channel to apply the effect on black / white photos , because the colour can be missing .
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ ming is applied to a landscape photo of New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the image was shown below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the movie was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of A@@ ura in the top .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter screening test is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool for creating film trays like the B / W Kodak Tri @-@ X . in order to increase the sensitivity of the films by the manufacturers , the manufacturers and the phot@@ ographi@@ sion of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film trans@@ verse effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ photographic , gra@@ ding view , looking for your monoch@@ ro@@ men photos , you have to use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can calibr@@ ated according to the control of intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of Kör@@ ner calibr@@ ated . the default value is even higher values are set to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more bask@@ ets , you can use the filter times several times .
this is an example of the film trans@@ formations on a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the image ( 2 ) used . the used film sensitivity is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the oil used oil is created ; filter oil paintings created the appearance of an oil painting . it uses an ur@@ able legal algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter oil paintings gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and styles are good for this effect .
there exist two control to influence this effect . the upper select the pin@@ sel@@ size is between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better for large pictures . smooth@@ es the thro@@ tt@@ le or , from the other side , the hin@@ ts .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and this is marked with the ( 2 ) . pin@@ sel@@ size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and G@@ lä@@ tte 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity . therefore , the lines that stem from slowly . however , pictures of their gra@@ fts are not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful how to imagine what the scene you would have chosen . this would be good pictures to start any way .
there are two regul@@ ators with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller cho@@ oses the bottom size and lower the contrast ( G@@ lä@@ tte ) .
this is an example of the coal combustion filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adap@@ ting to the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter engra@@ ver sets out your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was used in wax . it uses a full copyright algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter engra@@ ver is a quick tool to give your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where color does not use the most important content . the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to turn the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ing landscape .
the depth allows the contrast of fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the image ( 2 ) used . the depth is 10 % .
using this filter group you can transform a normal photo taken into a work of artwork by dis@@ arm@@ ing effects . it uses copyright law of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
shaft blocks 1 : how the image in cells have a and let us look , as if it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the shaft blocks 1 becomes the picture here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can break this effects at any time with the knob .
using this filter group you can transform a normal photo in an art work by means of in@@ visual effects . it uses copyright law of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom &apos; acuity : ver@@ wis@@ s the picture along with a focus , which simul@@ ate evidence of a zo@@ oming camera , thereby simul@@ ates a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often in the sporting photography .
radic@@ als : ver@@ wis@@ s the image through rotation of the pixels in order to be a focus . this simul@@ ates accident prevention of rotating camera .
distances of distances : ver@@ wis@@ s the image about the effect of a not focus on camera . the object seems to occur in the background .
visual acuity : un@@ certain the picture by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates damage and visual acuity of linear , z : B : from one car or train photographs , camera .
very visual acuity : the image soft in the dark and strong in the light tones . this creates photos with a dream and smooth focus ( Hamilton Eff@@ ect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portrait , gl@@ amour photos or to add a warm and subtle g@@ low .
Schüt@@ tel@@ in@@ acuity : therefore , the picture caused by acci@@ dental shift of the pixels and simul@@ ated the im@@ pregn@@ ation of a consistent camera .
intelligent Un@@ acuity : the color basin in the picture and know@@ le@@ ak up to change it without the rest .
mos@@ aic : the photo in rectangular cells and created it , by adding an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation using the knob .
the shelves are a nice small tool to make shelves on your picture . this gives natural your pictures a native appearance . it is used by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n @-@ copyright algorith@@ m .
tropical size allows the size of the drops to change the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number of changes and the density of the drops . fish changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
you can stick with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ dy . use the option to choose from the area , e.g. a face , which will be free to choose from . if you start the filter Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es , the area will remain open from Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es .
this is an example of the shelves Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the image ( 2 ) indicates an sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the picture is the wrong orientation , so you can bring it by mirrors or turning into the right orientation . the tools you can find in the menu Trans@@ forming Dre@@ ams and trans@@ forming .
photo pen is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo to enlarge with a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to handle is easy . the great question is , how can you find a picture on the image ? how can you find the lack of information can be found or ro@@ asted ? the C@@ im@@ g algorith@@ m is used here , makes here a good work . try and you will see it yourself .
if a picture size , you can change it to the desired size with the size of the tool . select the trans@@ forming size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog box is shown below .
the tool used to change a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to view the pixels . if you want a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to put the tool .
many image processing is using a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , for example Spl@@ itting inter@@ pol@@ ation for the image . the underlying algorith@@ m photo was developed by IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to change the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the new size in the new size :
aspect ratio : if this adjustment is activated , if the setting is activated , it will retain the aspect ratio of the original size of the original size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . this is necessary if it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ bul@@ lets you need to be higher than 3 .
the buttons Save as well as charging will be used exactly . any explanation for picture can be saved as text file and later will be loaded later .
it is very fast with what it makes it , but it can still take a very long time and take a high CPU load . you can break the calculation in any time with the knob .
you can see below for a picture below , by a small color picture to double the size . the original image ( 1 ) and the increased image ( 3 ) is increased . the image ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard increased compared to comparison .
the cutting of a photos is not only a common operation , but also a often under@@ stand@@ able tool to create a picture . in order to create a picture with mouse , click the mouse button , by pressing the mouse button , and draw your rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle when you move the mouse .
if you want to cut the mouse button , the area will cut off the road . thus , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle , by clicking the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle create it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the recording , use the button image processing of image processing in the tool bar and the photo will be tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file to store or file storage below in the menu file to save the newly built photo .
in the lecture area you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by clicking the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio which you will be defined in the dialog .
with the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format , the larger value of the height and the size of the width is assigned .
the tool can cut a relative aspect ratio of the aspect ratio , regardless of whether you can use centimeters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and its aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue there exist two buttons for the selection of automatically horizontal or ver@@ tically .
below , you can use the Max . ratio button to cut the maximum possible , depending on the selected ratio and orientation .
the tool can be used by the aspect ratio ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you are displayed , this settings are displayed as standard values in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data will be reflected on the cut picture and not the original image .
the settings of the work must help you to make your images better , so that help you want to make your images better .
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic parts are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ party , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles at the diagonal .
golden Mitte : the Golden Mitte is a split which is on different natural growth , like the spiral of a N@@ auti@@ lus shell or the bl@@ ender of a sun@@ flower . it is mentioned in all possible things that we find as beautiful .
the Golden division is the ir@@ r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the old Egyptians and architects . artists and architects have used the Golden division in all times when you create your images , buildings and even photos gathered to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number leads from the fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 and etc ; from where every number is 1 : 1,@@ 618 the golden centre . a composition which is usually defined as visual harmon@@ ically .
the golden Mitte is liquid auxiliary lines provided for you when you put a picture . this is shown below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will be able to achieve good results for your photos . compared to third party , the golden spiral has a liquid line of the eye . this type of composition leads along the line of the spiral and makes a symmet@@ rical visual river .
a further rule will be used to create the golden spiral , the golden spiral . it should be something that the eye should be the center of the composition . that can be just a line or different objects . this is just a little bit just because his eye will be able to use its task .
the Golden Tri@@ bes are also reflected from the above @-@ mentioned golden spiral . please note that , in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles do not include a twi@@ sty tri@@ angles . diagonal amounts to these lines can be found .
if you use golden tri@@ angles using the work of professional photographer dynamic Sy@@ mmet@@ rie . try out your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can not reach different .
the options for the horizontal and vertical mirrors can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the button color you can set the color of the relief lines . if you set a picture with many colors and a high contrast , you can customi@@ ze the set @-@ lines . on this way , you can customi@@ ze the color of the lines your latest picture .
the Free press is a tool to turn an image to turn any angle .
if you make a photo , it happens to keep the camera not exactly ver@@ tically and horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the camera is made by an angle . image processing and tool @-@ free web press . select the trans@@ forming free web press and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with sliding angle . the values on this sli@@ p@@ case is specified in degrees . with the knob there you can set the sli@@ der again to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image is displayed on the right side .
to your help the module free a horizontal and vertical line available . move the mouse po@@ inter in the image preview . after making it an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as in previous section .
after you have a picture @-@ shot , you are able to find a tri@@ angular holes in the corners . possibility of repair it is the function of trans@@ forming cutting out of image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is the function Automatic . choose one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option is smo@@ othing the picture a bit after turning . please note the above warning .
all Peru@@ vian trans@@ formations are carried out by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
in order to change the perspective , you have to view the red quad@@ rate at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialogue you will find some information about what you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas , the empty area produced by the transformation .
new height : showing the height of the new image , including empty areas , the empty area produced by the transformation .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the trans@@ forming area .
angle right above : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the trans@@ forming area .
angle left down : shows the current angle in degrees on the bottom left corner of the trans@@ forming area .
angle right : shows the current angle in degrees on the bottom right corner of the trans@@ forming area .
after the adaptation of the perspective , the image is a little bit . for a single adaptation , this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations provide a double or strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you get the perspective , you have an amaz@@ ed tri@@ angular holes of the corners . one possibility to ber@@ ed this , it is possible to cut the picture with trans@@ forming cutting out of the image processing .
the switching tool is used to move a part of the image to the left and the lower part of the image . this is not a turning , the image is torn . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via trans@@ forming .
make your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can set horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you set by default , the angle is displayed and the new dimensions of the target will be displayed and displayed the new dimensions of the target range .
to your help you get a vertical and a horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point like the lake , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the switch tool to adjust your image .
after you have completed the switch , the image is a bit ver@@ wis@@ s . for a single loop is the effect is neg@@ li@@ gible , but two sh@@ ell@@ ations of generating twice as much bu@@ isch@@ ation and therefore you should avoid this .
after closing the picture is un@@ nice and tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one possibility to remove this image with trans@@ forming cutting out of the image processing .
&amp; take delivery ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read image formats , therefore , from your system , and in some cases , can be used by the type of libraries , and in most distri@@ butions , you can find a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ ous .
due to this depen@@ dency of other libraries , it is impossible to enter the list of any file formats on their system . you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF as well .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; only files in different formats can be found in the list . if the extension is listed in the list . if the extension is used in image processing . you can change this list of file extension &amp; digi@@ tised ; it can change more information . in the configuration , you will find additional information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to select the file format . a detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; take delivery ; both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression system to digital images . redundant information , to save the image data on a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smooth results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s , it can also store loss@@ less if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw material format , you can read the copy of raw materials in English or TI@@ FF , you can read the raw images of JPEG or TI@@ FF , you can find further information on the use of modules and digi@@ tised . in the section configuration you can find further information on the use of modules and digi@@ tised .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; supports the store of raw images only supported by the program , which can be seen in &amp; digi@@ ous . this allows you to see more than 200 raw data formats . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that came from &amp; digi@@ tised , are supported :
many digital cameras provide the recording play . these clips are often stored in the AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format . if you click on a film file , but it &apos;s not click on a film file , click the &amp; K@@ DE ; settings for playback of movies to play the program for playback .

using the menu entry settings ; read more about the menu entry , you can read the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; change the settings of the user interface ; in the following section of the user book , you will be discussed .
on the left you see six different symbols , with which you can call the preview and options for the viewer . for every setting , you can call a button on the F1 button and click on the desired option .
in this context , as you can set up for each picture , for example persons , places , places and key@@ words . you can also create your own groups such as items , animals or albums .
in view of the dialog box , which is used to process pre @-@ existing groups . for each existing group you can choose a label and a symbol .
in the section , there were already mentioned categories as mentioned in the dialog . in the dialog box , you can set all members of a group on once in a group rather than any group of groups as in a group .
you can see the adjustment possibilities which are available to guests . with the up@@ loading list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left @-@ hand side is a list with the current category and in the right @-@ hand part of the sub@@ categories .
the module system is based on other graphic applications , such as digi@@ ti@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; K@@ DE ; Image Plu@@ gin interface . nails can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called upon the menu modules , which are not described in this manual , because they are not part of &amp; ch@@ able album ; however , the modules have to be sold separately . however , most modules have a help , which you can call over the modules itself .
since the modules of multiple applications can be used together with the demo database , you can use this module with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu process . don &apos;t know , I would not be warned !
the applications that are using the modules via K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , making it possible that some modules are with &amp; ch@@ able album ; not work . this is the draw@@ back if you have a variety of applications .
the largest difference between &amp; ch@@ able album ; and other applications that do not use their images in albums by other applications : this type of order is not supported , simul@@ ated it for some modules the order to albums , so that you can use the features with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ;
this will simul@@ ates &amp; cold album , the current album , which is simply the current album , thus all pictures that show you the picture of this review .
in addition to the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also must have a list of albums by albums . here &apos;s &amp; illustrated album , as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , in the browser the contents of a category shows , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module .
or it is the category that you have set the category dialog for virtual albums by category . for example , if you use the category 4 , it will be able to be &amp; illustrated album ; so if you selected people to view and enter the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove this from the list of modules . start the installation dialog and select the modules that modules are loaded to modules .
on the picture you see an example for a start screen , once you start &amp; delicious album ; with your own pictures .
as you can see it from any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window with which you can read more about your pictures . in the section we will check on this window , but now click on the entry pictures , which shows you an overview of all the pictures show .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , is the possibility to see each image by comments on the picture , etc . you can set up each image either separately or for a larger number of images . if , for example , in all pictures of Jes@@ se , and all pictures were included in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and browser as you can read in the section . if you want to see this comments if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
you can see three lists with a text field by offering people , places and key@@ words . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you can always use it again , if you set information about your pictures .
the following idea is the move within the list : if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures of the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can find that the name must be moved up after above , which can be found faster and easily .
if you prefer to select a alpha@@ bet list , click on the icon for sorting to date under the list .
if you have been selected for each image , you may still want to edit all the selected images and these pictures are made . click in this case simply to the picture above and back @-@ up , which are under the preview of the picture above .
for example , if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , you can find it more convenient to mark these images and to use the menu entries to one note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
in the picture you &apos;ll see a browser window onto the USA as an over@@ group . to show that , a special icon is displayed .
in the context menu of the remarks di@@ alog@@ s it is possible to add an entry to an existing category or sub@@ missions . in addition , please also make one entry to an existing category . attention , this puts that you just imagine your categories to alpha@@ be@@ tic .
you can move the individual elements of the remarks di@@ alog@@ s by adding the cor@@ est , which form the top edge of the frame , and move through a separate window by adding it out of the window .
if you &apos;re looking for the appearance of the window as to your needs , please click on the button , click on the button options ... that gives you the possibility to store the current construction and appearance of the window .
you can also see a frame in a frame . if you would like to get a window later , use the button options ... and here you can see a / out sofa . click on the picture .
if you select an entry in the browser , select an overview of the pictures of the currently selected images , or all pictures you have no filter . for example , you can see the size of the pre @-@ mouse images , by simply remove the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure it .
if you have a picture on the background of your desktop space , this image is set up as background image for your desktop space .
once you click once on a picture , this is displayed in the image . if you have not open a window with a picture frame , a new display is created .
you can delete the images in the image . simply select the corresponding pictures you want to ext@@ ingu@@ ish , or select either the removing button or choose or delete the menu . now the window is displayed , which you can see in the picture .
&amp; illustrated album , you can use this problem . you can use the images stored on the hard disk . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all the pictures of the hard disk can be loaded up to .
pictures , in which the right upper corner is cut , are not available on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the pictures are available , so that you can display the preview of these images . however , these pictures can &apos;t see these pictures with the image .
as you see this function does not need to copy files from the folders . if you want to avoid trouble to retri@@ eve your images . if you want to avoid trouble to your pictures , please buy a larger hard drive to store all the pictures .
in the menu images , you will find a sub @-@ menu in the menu of the menu . alternatively , you would like to check out what you want to check out what you want to see your little sister , you can also see all the pictures that you can choose your little sister , besides a current view .
this means you want to hide what pictures are hidden in the case . if you want a laptop to your little sister , then select the menu entry , which will be locked out . if you want to put the pictures once again , click on sper@@ re .
it is also possible to specify a password , which must be entered to the un@@ lock pictures . to create this password , simply select password in the menu of privacy .
please remember that this picture is not safe . if all pictures can be read on the hard disk and delete them . this type of password protection is only allowed to view the file with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar , view to private pictures .
the reason why you &apos;re looking to describe all your images with &amp; ch@@ able album ; this is of course you want to look at some time . this is why &amp; photo@@ illustrated album ; for this reason , you can find out of the preview , as described in described in .
the viewer can see . it is of course the picture , but you can see all the information about the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if you want to see the Info@@ box in the upper part of the image , you can also select this simply by mouse . you can also configure and check if all these options are displayed after a right @-@ click on the viewer . then you can see the context menu @-@ text menu .
some words in the Info@@ box are printed . if you click on this , see the right entries to this . if you click on the browser , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene have chosen .
if you have several pictures on viewing , you can turn between them and back , by clicking the buttons for high and image . you can use the first and last image with trumpet 1 and end . these functions are also reachable from the context menu .
if several pictures are loaded up , then you can run this as a new picture after a few seconds . how often a new image invites you to press the str@@ g button and Plus or Min@@ us press . the sli@@ des@@ au is started through the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the observer was done by &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is used to change the full screen . in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input button to change in full screen and back .
if you use the viewer . for example , you can easily draw a rect@@ angle . with the Min@@ us button , you can turn back to the center of the image . how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is marked as a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle , and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button , you can return your zoom , so that the picture does not appear in the zoom . with the equ@@ alization of the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel is equivalent to a pixel image of the image .
note that the only zoom @-@ style file operations work with videos , that come in and out of zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ and Min@@ u@@ st@@ aste .
with the shooting features from the context menu you can turn the picture . this works does not work with videos . you can do remarks on the current picture with the menu item to the context menu .
if you consider it a picture that you will find a picture with one person , the name you can do in the picture . at the moment you can view the check and configuration dialog for the image in order to view these names . however , it may withdraw it only to mark the picture and look for further pictures .
a further situation is that you want to send a number of images on a printer to watch the pictures on paper . see what pictures you want to start the viewer as well as a good or bad mark@@ ings , while one can see it on the other .
for the two examples of the amount you have the possibility to see the possibility of images with the features . features the letters A up to Z and you can view a feature that you can press the corresponding letters . in you see an image where features A , B and C are set .
once you have access to your pictures , you can view it in the browser . if you want to print all the pictures you want to print . this is in this case you can use an module to copy the selected images on a CD , or whatever you want to make you just want .
these categories and special features can be displayed in pre @-@ show view , then you can add features to the pictures , by simply selecting the letters for the feature , after the image was chosen . this enables you to see here :
sometimes it is not clear that you want to show on a painting . for this case you will be able to paint you &amp; fot@@ able album ; on the pic to paint it .
the mixture is not stored with the image , but in the database . on the way you can make your painted @-@ old later on the way .
you can see a picture on the painting . to enter the painting from the context menu . to finish the picture from the context menu . to finish the cross , simply finish the cross in the tool bar at the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; work , you must have to read the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully read , but the documentation of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you necessarily be read and understood .
in the object of the object , you can select individual objects . then the properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire @-@ views are represented .
you can also select several objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , as all objects already have been selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to add the object and click on the symbol in the tool bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
there are multi @-@ possible positions , the following mounting menu is inserted , so that you can choose the right position :
with holes either from the menu bar under edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove the selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed features , click on the application to accept these changes . if you set invali@@ d values a message with error description . then you can click the input manual and re@@ trac@@ ed the changes using the error .
when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation on the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the accommodation shown with the help .
you need &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user document to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 also contains the user documentation .
if you have a texture or a part of a texture , you can view a preview of the property view .
press a preview of the self @-@ made view and a small example of the scene is chosen with the chosen texture . if you want to select the texture of the texture ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check it locally .
the screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can pull this control points with the mouse button , enabling the position and change of the camera .
if a transformation is chosen , disappear the control points and it is displayed a small cross in the wire view . this cross marked the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position of displacement . you can change the shift by Zi@@ ig@@ ning with the mouse within the entire round .
each object has a limitation level . you can specify this value to sight of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects will be displayed , if they are selected or their sight @-@ down level , or equal to the support level of visual acuity of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er : has a window arrangement as default . the object design and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views are indicated .
if you don &apos;t like to set the standard window settings like or if you need a different arrangement , you can save them from anywhere . you can also save multiple window orders and simply to change between different orders .
to view a window over or under one present view , draw the beg@@ inner to the top or bottom edge of a view . a rect@@ angle shows the new position .
to create a new column , draw your beg@@ inner to your right or left @-@ hand view . the new view is an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left hand , and extends over the entire height .
if you want to configure several views on each other , please keep the start of your views on a other view . you can view it between the views of clicking on the box top in the sight .
the last possible window arrangement are dirty views : views , which are an@@ cho@@ red on the main window . to solve a view of the start of the working area or click on the small way to the left button in the original sp@@ lash@@ ing .
to close a view , click on the small Cross in the stretch bar . to prevent the track , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can add extra views in the main window . in the menu , you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are sh@@ aken , you can spread them at any point .
the current window view can store with view of the window of windows ... to save it is a dialog box , in which you can save the window of the window under an existing or new name .
if you have a scene , you can ren@@ ew them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses a program to be installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 is currently working . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to ren@@ ew the current scene , click on the symbol Ren@@ ders , the symbol Ren@@ ders in the tool bar , or select the menu entry into the scene .
plug @-@ in mode meets the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s IN@@ I files . it determin@@ es the image size and quality of Ren@@ ders . if you want to add a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can add a number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of up to full pictures of the highest quality .
if you click on the icon The R@@ ender in the tool bar , or in the menu exhibition R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... choose the following dialog :
each rating mode has a name . you can set any name any name , but it is a name to recognize the characteristics of the mode .
in the map size , you can carry the width and height of the image . if you want to create a small area of the image , select the check@@ box sub@@ section and enter the frame section to Ren@@ ders in the input fields .
in combination with quality you can select the properties which use &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection lighting . an exhaus@@ tive description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the us@@ erh@@ and@@ buch &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture comes with only one beam , these images can arise different error . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ è @-@ pattern or step @-@ effects in curves and lines , sometimes details are not indicated when they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technology called anti @-@ ali@@ asing , to decrease the influence of this bug . generally , images are better from this feature .
when you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technology is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ re@@ locking method . the second method is adaptive , because every pixel is always under@@ stand@@ able and adapted because every pixel is dependent on the calculated color range .
if you choose the first method , using POV @-@ Ray , if you set the threshold levels of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you select the advantage of a certain amount of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you select the value of 4x4 extra points , if you receive an extra size of 5 to 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixels . the difference is then :
diff ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 @-@ b 2 )
the re@@ mod@@ elled method starts with 4 wires each pixels . if the difference between the color values exceed the threshold , then the pixels is divided into 4 sub@@ pixels , which can be tested individually and can be tested on further information . the maximum depth of the rec@@ ur@@ sion can be set with the depth .
another possibility of ali@@ asing effect is to reduce the generation of Rau@@ schen &apos;s trial , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch to J@@ at@@ ing , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays is to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular pattern .
the last setting for quality of Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light refl@@ on . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this box map , you can adjust the alpha channels by POV @-@ Ray . one pixel is then transparent when the associated rays must have no object .
opening a new window for the display of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ Con@@ sol@@ en@@ issue . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this reason .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene to import , select the menu entry file ... and choose a file with the menu window .
currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er is currently supported ; yet , not the complete command of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if the error messages can occur or warning , a dialogue is a list of all tun@@ es .
if you don &apos;t support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can add objects from object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import objects into the scene file , simply design the source code in the editor , simply select the source code in the Editor and draw it into the object .
with copying and plug in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also included in your editor .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called upon when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er is depicted ; this is usually the PO@@ V@@ RAY or x @-@ PO@@ V@@ RAY .
when you click on the property view , click &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; die &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user docum@@ enting the object . put here the path to your document and version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; sear@@ ches the files to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries you can refer to the files of the scene , you do not have to enter the path to these files . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first discovered file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color will be used for display of selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color will be used for display of selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the visual field in camera @-@ view and in the window type mark .
you can adjust the object @-@ beginning of the points in the context menu of the wireless menu of the wireless menu . you can set the grid separately for displacement , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values make a more accurate model , and thus require better nails for the shown objects , but require more time to renov@@ ations . for several objects , such as the ball you can set the detail level for two directions .
if you need High detail and extended projections , all wire @-@ off views are further divided , if the camera uses an enhanced project projection . this property takes to better rap@@ proch@@ ement with exceptions , but requires more time for the projections , but requires more time to Ren@@ dering .
when you cross a wall mount , a wall behind the objects is ger@@ ed . the wall is represented in a chess pattern , consisting of two adjustable colours .
when you cross the bottom there is a ground below the objects . the floor is displayed in a chess pattern , consisting of two adjustable colours .
if you lose edge smooth@@ ness , the non @-@ re@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method applied for the scenes of the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . precise data to the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di .
on this site , you can modify the existing window orders or new window orders . in the section of window @-@ orders , how to create window orders and save them .
the combination of the standard window placement : shows all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen windows order in the program .
the list of Ex@@ hau@@ ling techniques shows all the existing window orders . a new arrangement allows you to add the button , and delete the selected arrangement with the button .
every window of window is identified by the name . the name must be clear and cannot be empty .
the list under the name shows all views of the chosen windows order . new views can add the button to add and remove selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with mis@@ cell@@ ed , you get a cart@@ on view together with the previous view and web@@ space , the view of the main window but creates a separate window .
you &apos;ve just got &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; installed and now you want to follow the knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should consider the ultimate but simple scene to create very popular : one ball on one level .
but you should have the following war@@ nings , so before you have about that you can only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D program for you , you should note this important rules :
if you don &apos;t want to adjust the camera to be applied , as a result , you will receive a black picture .
if you don &apos;t add a light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will only receive a black picture .
if you have anything without any errors , you see at first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; the following pre @-@ set window changes :
take a little time to learn the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar . read the documentation , so you can get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will have to use these menus and symbols , therefore , you should find the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er : starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you need to remove all objects from the object tree . mark the scene , then select the menu entry , and then you have a scene without objects without objects .
the wireless model view shows the whole scene , which you create . in particular , you will notice that in the fourth wire @-@ view ( right bottom ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this is showing the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree has now includes a new entry with the designation Camera . if you click on the contents of object properties , in which the different parameters of the camera can be found in the user documentation &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you will find additional details .
change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , which is later to change it , but you can change the camera in view of the camera , using the left mouse button on a control point and draw it to the desired place .
if you press the button application or the input button , the wireless model views and the object is immediately following this settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . it might be set for example a qu@@ ader ( insert ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a reversible method applied to this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; in fact , offers an easier way to use . you can use the infin@@ ite plain as a ground :
a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and press the knob button . in object tree the new name is immediately displayed .
the wireless model view is now also the level , even at the moment only as a limited level . when you render the scene , the level up to the horizon .
if you can check the object tree , if you click on the symbol no . in this case you can see the various parameters of the object . in this case you can only find the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , turning and shift . select one of this options , also the possible settings in view of object properties .
in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , so that you get to learn some of these parameters . select the shift and adjust the values as follows :
choose the floor from to set up its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose the moment a little bit of the moment .
in both cases , a dialogue in which you can select , as the object will then be displayed in object tree . you can view the name in the property view ( name = floor @-@ Pig@@ ment ) , with one click on the button , you looks like the pig@@ ments .
of course , the preview of pig@@ ments are only need to enter the pig@@ ments . remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with one click on preview . enter the colors for the pig@@ ments . also , there are many ways to check the colours now .
when you don &apos;t see in the preview no color on Qu@@ ader and ball , click only on the button application and call the preview .
the material for the floor is now properly set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the symbol , you should receive the following result :
of course , the color does not need to enter the color . choose two new attributes needed . select this entry you have to do this entry twice ( you may also do more frequently , but the chess board @-@ color list can only be used only with two colours ) :
choose the object tree in the object of any object and change the colors in view of object properties :
this step you should already run just as you can use the fundamental work of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball should be just as easy as the floor :
in the view of object properties you can change the settings for the radius : 1 ( don &apos;t forget to pressing the input button or the button on the floor . otherwise , the sphere has the ground up to the bottom , because you have moved the ground to bottom one unit .
of course , Ren@@ ders is now a strange result : as already in advance , the ball surface appears as a mat black material . set the following step in the following step .
if you have selected the ball , you can now show a material . like on the ground , you enter the ball a pig@@ ments as color :
select the best accommodation and change the name for example in ball Pig@@ ment . click on ball pig@@ ments , select the color and adjust the values as follows :
but you can get more interesting effects if you arrive at the time , some finish properties allow to set some finish properties :
change the values like in the following screens and click on the application or press the input button .
the settings are also shine and reflection on partially good visual effects , perfect for glass or chromium surfaces , even if metal : even not selected :
you should now have an excellent impression of what offers you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hop@@ efully you &apos;ve already learned about many , but you can create simple , but nice scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a method applied to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional image or a model .
if you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing , which is reflected from the perspective of the observer , such as these stra@@ igh@@ tened by objects , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and as an atmospheric effects , such as fog , the scene is processed for pixels .
as you can imagine how to watch the camera , you can view the camera . without a light source , you will also see nothing , the image is just black . obviously , each scene is obviously , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . PO@@ V@@ RAY file is usually the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you can open a new model , or create the file in this sub @-@ menu , and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name , it is a new file , you need to enter a name and a storage space .
the scene is stored in the last stored version . all changes have been subjected since the last storage .
this menu entry can only select only if you have not saved changes in the scene .
repeatedly made the last visible command . this menu entry can only select only if you use editing .

a B@@ um@@ p @-@ Map is a way to smoke @-@ proof surfaces without any be@@ ek@@ le on the surface , without having to change the geomet@@ rical form of the lens itself .
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ um@@ p @-@ map as well as for a texture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ rical forms that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic body . these models will continue to be mach@@ ined to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture map is an option to give the surface of an object colour to pixel @-@ basis , using an image file as a color card .

the user can select the use of sc@@ anners , and OK to open the scanner . break &amp; s@@ kan@@ l@@ ite ; finish .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the T@@ rei@@ bers . &amp; s@@ kan@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) treats these options .
to make a painting only , the user can start a preview can start and then see a scanning range for the final scan . the pre@@ ach@@ able can start through the preview button .
to choose the image better , the user can choose into the image and from the current selection of zo@@ oming . it can set the zoom as so that the complete preview of the window will fit into the window .
when the image was selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if you selected a preview of the memory in the settings the picture is displayed , then the image is displayed in a ball@@ ast window , as shown below , then the image is stored and sh@@ lie ? EN leads to a crash and you get back to the main window .
by the button settings the same name is open on the same window as the main window . you can change the most important settings .
the user may consider the picture if desired , in front of the memory . in this case , the option must be chosen a preview of memory . if this preview of the user is not desired , then the option must be cho@@ oses .
this setting allows you to select the way as &amp; s@@ kan@@ l@@ ite ; pictures can select the dialog for each image . if &amp; s@@ kan@@ l@@ ite , this automatically open the dialog with a generated name in a defined folder , then you have to select storage without any fil@@ en@@ ames .
this setting defines where the pictures can be saved without a fil@@ en@@ ames without a file name , then this folder is used as standard for the dialog box . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the knob .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the image to be stored in the dialog . the following picture shows a numer@@ ical Su@@ ff@@ ix of the jed@@ es@@ mal when a painting is stored whenever a painting is stored . the string # # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the memory image quality . this value changes also the compression value when needed . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the knob starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; s@@ kan@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button Over is launching the K@@ DE Over -@@ dialog for &amp; s@@ kan@@ l@@ ite ; the button settings can be used to finish the dialog for Settings and Sch@@ ed@@ l@@ ite ;

you can select any existing multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ short commands . thus , you will make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Control Centre .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions that can be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ CO@@ P features of collection , context @-@ browser , players , playlist , playlist and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ CO@@ P function returns &amp; z@@ b ; therefore look :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE ; in addition , Amar@@ ok still supports some own command line options .
you should specify a feedback if the script will not work for a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script whether all the required modules are present and take advantage of the user that the user is not running why a script will not work .
Beg@@ in Re@@ qu@@ ire &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE Bin@@ dings for Ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the folder / Wedding , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can simply use it as the basis for your own scripts , or simply add the required functions . you will find fast that writing of scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P you can control your scripts with Amar@@ ok F@@ dust and Amar@@ ok . its sim@@ pl@@ est way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p , which should be used every K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the cause of external programs and commands . this is usually the function Ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . here , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is relatively simple , here one example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok , sends al@@ erts on all current scripts . for this reason , you should have their standard settings and react to events . of course , you should also ignore the events even if there is no use of any scripts .
configure it is the script to show the location dialog . to show the memory and loading of the setup data . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work folders to the folders where all dates are stored .
track@@ Change sign@@ alling that a new piece is played . the script could be played &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P features further information about the new p@@ olls ( for example , the met@@ ad@@ ata or the unit length ) .
high @-@ volumes new@@ volume signals a change of the volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
custom menu Men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu entry into the selected files of the playlist , you can use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ men@@ it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) . in order to remove an entry to remove d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ men@@ it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok , when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; this signal should be processed to the script . this signal should be processed to perform , for example the storage of data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ok script will also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server and can be downloaded from a web server . for example , we recommend an archive name such as scripts . tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 , so the user can mount the archive to be recognized as Amar@@ ok script Package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the creation of amar@@ ok@@ script . therefore , you should run your script packages immediately right .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining module should be not exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script is ready , you can upload it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry in K@@ DE @-@ apps , you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; K@@ DE ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can also go to the playlist instead of endless menus . maybe you are also looking for a totally given title of thousands of your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s Coll@@ ectors Browser and the quick search will you find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have a few playlist , but you can listen to what you would like to hear ? and if you &apos;re still difficult to keep the right mode , select the dynamic mode and the intelligent playlist automatically the correct music according to certain criteria .

relative paths to manually stored re @-@ stored : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the memory location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of music files saved .
current pieces of the product changes are visible , allowing the playlist of the playlist / off , to keep the current pieces always in the visible window area .
when changing to the context @-@ browser , you will automatically switch to the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played .
the lower section , you can customi@@ ze &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the appearance is in three parts .
in the font section you can select the use of various writings in &amp; Amar@@ ok . you can select writings on the following section : playlist windows , player windows and context @-@ browser . press to select ... so you can choose a desired font from the category dialog .
with the selection of user @-@ defined color sch@@ ema , you have to set the qu@@ al of choice and can be able to place a private color scheme , which , including the activated color displays for front and background colour .
playing at the start , and &amp; Amar@@ ok , after the program start the playback automatically with the piece at the place , with whom she was stopped at the last place .
the flush on @-@ screen display feature enables you to use the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display , a preview of O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click to select from the dialog box for the O@@ SD . the check box in the shadow is sh@@ aded , that the text was displayed in the O@@ SD .
in own colours you use the possibility to match the O@@ SD colours for writing and background . one click on the colour surfaces opens the dialog for color selection . if O@@ wn colors are not activated , the default value &amp; K@@ DE are not activated .
the input field display output can be adjusted in the O@@ SD text . the input can be adjusted to the O@@ SD . below , you will find a list of the available space holder and what they mean .
the screen screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . so that you can place it on the screen of a multi @-@ cavity monitor in the O@@ SD .
the audio card audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers will enable further adjusting possibilities to the box map .
the map collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of the database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok , to listen to music files . in order to enter the folders in addition to his name , check the check box in addition to its name . this section contains also the check box for mounting , as well as to the selected folders .
sub@@ ord@@ ner re@@ ates : this could cause &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed threads as well as their sub@@ ord@@ ner to music as well .
changes are done : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. music files will be added or deleted ) . furthermore , an un@@ break@@ able search will be carried out to allow the necessary modifications to your collection .
import them to your collection : avoi@@ ding &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all @-@ found playlist to your collection devices ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) were added to your collection . then , the automatically added playlist will then be added later in the playlist .
part of a Coll@@ ectors database is used to choose a database for the collection . the combination panel drivers : can be chosen between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is required , another setting is required in the window of My@@ S@@ q@@ l .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setting is used to set the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s database . afterwards , on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is set to enter the database , where the database can be reached via the database . name : is the database name to which the connection is made .
use user name : and password : to enter the data required for the connection to the database .
the cart@@ on card load is the support for load .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it can create the names of played pieces on a load @-@ load server and if required music recommendations on the actual unit .
here you enter your us@@ ername and password for your load .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the load .@@ f@@ m website .
music plays and so the profile update : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the names of the played plays at your load .@@ f@@ m profile .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , visit the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos .
Amar@@ ok requires only the package of K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no further K@@ DE packages have to be installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok now ) requires some of them to be written for such as modules or scripts . we have a small guide to be compiled as you can choose K@@ deli@@ bs .
some functions such as O@@ SD is sure that your window manager will operate the relevant standards of fre@@ es@@ tho@@ od . Gn@@ ome will try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ deli@@ o and Q@@ t , because these places provide excellent development environment .
probably , you will see a mistake in the day @-@ day library . you can check this error in the day of Tag@@ w@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org , and you can also hang the broken file that causes the crash file again . afterwards , you can delete the file and set the file again .
mostly it is that Tag@@ li@@ b over@@ lap the read of the met@@ a @-@ Infos from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you want to use MySQL as database , try out SQ@@ Lite . the support for this &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s support in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is somewhat mature .
make sure that all &amp; Amar@@ ok libraries used with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b , but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , this leads to crash with the editing of met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate autom@@ akers , if in@@ active for ... in the setting of sound system , or use at least a value of 1 second .
you can also send the back@@ pack by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will also be automatically with a crash ) . if you have a common down@@ turn , and you send us a good baking trace heating , the error will be resolved .
this is that many program can write data as UTF @-@ 8 in the Met@@ a @-@ Info , but this is not a Unicode record . the following Perl script will fixes the problem .
I / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The File $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error during writing of tags of $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; and $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : mp4 . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : mp4 &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s symbols are easily forgotten in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . please note that in some cases , you need to click on a icon in some cases up to three times in some cases .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : background Lo@@ ok@@ up error : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixel ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map , then check whether Amar@@ ok is the correct Q@@ t library . you can see it with ld@@ d &apos;@@ Ag@@ amar@@ ok@@ app _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p Q@@ T .
to recover this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ds Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf file that Amar@@ ok is the right version first .
there are several options to be the lightest by the help of a experts of your Uni@@ x@@ or Linux distribution . you can also use the Forum and I@@ RC in the developers and I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please get there only an error , if you &apos;re a little bit of the shift of a fault in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , it appears only a blank playlist . how to get music pieces there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left @-@ hand side and open the files . then draw the files into the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface , the start @-@ up window was converted into the statistics window . you can find it under ex@@ tras statistics .
the importance of these symbols are changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are automatically calculated for the user through the user , while the points are automatically calculated automatically .
to evaluate more pieces , check the evaluation of the playlist and select the column . click anywhere in the new evaluation column to use the evaluation to a piece . you can also use the quick release of Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this works also when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files that you want to remove , and press it to your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button to your selection and select a playlist from the foldable menu .
draw a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let them fall there , just as you do it with other files , just like it is : - )
in the tool bar , right next to the add @-@ button , the button is stored on the button . click on the button .
presumably the program X@@ M@@ MS config . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ de@@ vel package . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; just look after lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the equ@@ alizer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you can find it via the menu bar under the ex@@ tras ...
yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question has to support G@@ Stre@@ amer / X@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ M ? . like you see , we support so quite each only possible audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even be text and PNG !
it can be ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which is supplied to the default no MP3 decoder . solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 K@@ DE , input button
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s starting : - )
if you want to deliver the device driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must be able to deliver the same time and can be reached simultaneously by a sound card ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mix@@ ers ) . see the Hil@@ le@@ ell@@ ung D@@ mix for AL@@ SA .
the issue of this command should help you search for the problem of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify a different S@@ ink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) .
the sorry &amp; Amar@@ ok ; don &apos;t forget that media would be de@@ coded as you . G@@ Stre@@ amer , for most people the best choice when you get a dé@@ but with little over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded them and transm@@ its PCM data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend directly to AL@@ SA , just like X@@ ine .
use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ cing ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of FA@@ Q ! ) . make sure that art@@ ef@@ ra@@ pper is set SU@@ ID :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia Code@@ cs . read this error . read the sound of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA @-@ setting file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help you .
either use the Arts drivers but instead use G@@ Stre@@ amer or X@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts Code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
presumably the Arts drivers has been optimized for analy@@ zer , or decrease the size of the Arts @-@ buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the small buffer of buffer , the less applications react to visu@@ ali@@ zations . yes , this is an error , please help us to solve him .
G@@ Stre@@ amer has been installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , st@@ ling &amp; Amar@@ ok ; from why ?
after the installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . lead G@@ ST register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FA@@ Q . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask at the I@@ RC @-@ channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .

stores the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ames . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog box is displayed , select the folder and fil@@ en@@ ame file for the project file .
stores all open projects . this is the same when you want to retri@@ eve the file storage for each single project file .
includes the current project . if a project changed and not stored , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what happened . you can choose between Save and changes . furthermore , you can also break the sh@@ utter and the project could be opened .
exclu@@ de all filled projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if you want to ask for any other stored project , what should be done , just as if you had been hit for each project file .
includes all ge@@ ared projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each of the project is asked , what should happen , as if you have had been hit .
if you retri@@ eve this entry , you can select the files directly from the top @-@ view into the project . if the current project does not move directly from the top @-@ view , when the current project will appear on CD , the added files will appear in the basic version of the CD .
this dialogue is based on the dialog box for this dialogue . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , for burning the medium . the burning dialog can only open , if the project has already open data .
opens the features for the current project . here you can create many project @-@ related settings . every project type has different possible settings , most of them are described ? -@@ help ( reachable on the right mouse button ) .
this entry can only be used for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this is useful if you want to use files for a multi @-@ hand session CD . the data from previous session will always be used , even if this function is intended for you to see already existing files and folders .
this entry was posted in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function is to remove any files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function is not only from medium that ends only the files imported files again .
this is also possible to create a CD @-@ copy dialog . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a CD on a CD which you can also want to burn any time later . you should also prefer cl@@ ones if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
this allows you to create DVD copying dialog . alternatively , you can also use the copy of a DVD to another file . alternatively , there is also no need to burn any DVD using the copy of the copying process . additionally , the target medium should be large enough to record all the data ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
open the dialog for the soldering of a CD @-@ RW . thus , you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for the format of a DVD . with this dialog , you can form@@ att@@ ed a DVD ± R ( W ) format , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b allows you to write a choice between the write modes and incre@@ mental enco@@ ders .

a previously tested DVD video can be converted into a DVD @-@ video . this dialogue is usually used to be used on a DVD in the table , but can also be used there . it contains information about the used video , encoding settings and even possibilities to modify the size and cut black edges .
displays information on the included medium . this information will be shown in the table view and include features of media , such as size and title @-@ length of the CD or DVD .
showing a list of tool bar at &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if one entry is requested , the tool bar is currently visible at the main window .
if this is crossed , a small body is displayed at the bottom edge of the window . it contains information on the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not attached , the status bar ends .
the party view consists of an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the content is activated , the content is displayed in the table view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu functions such as media info , sper@@ m and un@@ lock of the media .
switches the content to view it or from the files into the project view . the table view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive was selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in order view .
the head@@ bar in the project view consists of a narrow range , which is only visible , if the project view is open projects . the head@@ bar has no real function , it looks only beautiful and separates the project view of the remaining views .
this will open a dialogue window to modify the keyboard orders for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard to the below .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setting assist@@ ants . thus , the correct per@@ missions can be set correctly for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrators need to enter the password in the system ; therefore , you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialogue is intended for person@@ alize and adjust the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; as many other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications can also be equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled over a sh@@ ell@@ ery .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions you can use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or a bit more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functional scope , therefore it is rather a taste and the kind of your task is crucial to give you the programs .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to make sure the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P should make sure you must ensure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started ; then enter just like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; K@@ DE have already supported , assisted &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts , which are described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; features such as cop@@ y@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ audio CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ audio CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f &quot; ( ) v@@ oid &quot; D@@ v@@ d ( ) v@@ oid bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) v@@ oid bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) v@@ oid bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can produce a project about the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . use of this reference is possible to change the project about K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface , and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface , which can be used only on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
v@@ oid cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string Par@@ ent ) v@@ oid single Ur@@ l ( K@@ URL : : List UR@@ Ls , Q@@ string Par@@ ent ) v@@ oid Deh@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string ) , Q@@ string new@@ name ) v@@ oid set@@ yn@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string Quartet )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script will add a data project , several folders and add files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der / home / home / home / tru@@ sive / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is an audio CD ; audio @-@ read@@ ed for &amp; K@@ DE ; can be read and stored in MP3 or OGG files . other formats are possible depending on the Encoder installed on your computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oi@@ a ( compressed compression ) is supported by MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) . further coding can be added to the program ( if they have installed ) .
first the title of &amp; CD will be read and compressed into WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , this WAV files will be compressed into the MP@@ 3 or OGG format or other formats like the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oi@@ a . almost any distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if that is not installed , this must be done now .
for the second step , we have to be installed for any Linux distribution ( for MP3 ) , but it is not necessary to comp@@ ile it . but it &apos;s not only need to comp@@ ile it . if , for example , FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is not necessary .
what co@@ operated / file format should be used ? see chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer is a small introduction of Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to the copying of free audio CD ; it &apos;s not possible to remove any audio CD ; the program is not possible to avoid any audio CD ; in any case you can avoid &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; not the mechanisms of the copying protection may be missed . avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; it is not possible to avoid the copy of copy audio CD ;
while set only once you have to be found ( the setup dialog will be found ) , the daily transfer of a &amp; CD can be explained on the hard disk . this leads to the understanding for the slender approach of the user interface , which you are proud to check at the beginning of the beginning .
can convert to many formats - depending on what coding programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
it can pick &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b can pick up from the Internet or can work completely without a network where everything is identified manually .
this is only a short list of commands of the main window . on the page step , more information , such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program for the configuration of the program .
the CD@@ DB request the CD data will be using the CD @-@ Data according to the CD @-@ CD@@ DB . ( this may be locally or online , in the latter case you need to be connected to the Internet . )
the reading and - if a Encoder will be configured in the register parameter settings in the setup catalog - the coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of the available encoder , so that the selection can be read with a different encoder than the standard . it is to be observed that before the Encoder has been configured in the tab dialog for mounting settings .
opens the file manager , allowing an already used file to en@@ code the file , instead of a full &amp; CD ; the file manager will be encoded and en@@ code .
open the installation dialog for the kind of al@@ erts ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programming languages ( as read the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main landmark dialog for &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; with different map cards ( such as Encoder , for enco@@ ders of enco@@ ders ) , before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , coding and compression rates and helps you to choose the right encoding .
if any audio data are lost , it is necessary to do any audio format . apart from FLA@@ C , there are other like &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the small compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can use these files .
in addition to audio formats , you lose MP3 and OGG the most common . OGG mag now have a light advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above these bit@@ rate will provide differences , because both co@@ di@@ ers are very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be included with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with OGG slightly deeper than deeper bit@@ rates .
OGG - If only music is to be heard from a computer or machine @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG devices are present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB Stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo devices . today - early 2009 - these devices are usually only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting is good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most persons and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for stereo audio systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 - 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 k@@ bps . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less to less complex pieces of the unit . good enough for stereo audio systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . don &apos;t need 256 k@@ bps to complex and less complex pieces of a ti@@ ter . some older devices require CBR@@ . good enough for hi @-@ fi equipment with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR , common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all plays an Tit@@ le . good gen@@ ug for music of teenagers , portable devices and Auto@@ stere@@ o@@ ons . but not good enough for better stereo set audio systems .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most persons and most environments , but if you &apos;re absolutely the highest quality , you want to view the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD can be picked up , or through the program automatically from fre@@ ed@@ b to the internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can put / needed / needed with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; and the encoding program to create folders and file name as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with co@@ operating programs , there are often a combination of program settings for the Ko@@ di@@ erer and these parameters here . the manual or help to the Coalition explain the switch for these programs .
for example , if MP@@ 3@@ s are encoded with l@@ ame ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s must be encoded with l@@ ame , the switch board of l@@ ame and the title parameter from &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator will be added . the result sees that : &apos; ... Read More ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; parameters which can be used ( = button name in the assistance ) :
this is what the free database can read the audio CDs , so that all other information can be downloaded from the computer . it is to be observed that only by text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal anymore . however , no one can prevent the information on the &amp; CD ; and the information can be added on the &amp; CD ; therefore , any information can be added to the music company . all the information can be added to a &amp; CD by a &amp; CD ; business , physically , or virtu@@ ell .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; an address is used as being used in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address is not used on the retri@@ eve of the server ( this is not only the program@@ mer know that the code is checked . )
there are copies of major database copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; for use of fre@@ ed@@ b , ge@@ ographi@@ cally , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally set is to be used on the next profile server . this saves bandwidth between the network and the load between the machines .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirror @-@ demand for online demand from &amp; CD ; for information about a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually a monthly ) only the updates of the database .
what the read@@ ed program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
it is obvious that c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oi@@ a is used ; who want to be more accurate to check out the source code .... It &apos;s already the best choice for audio CD ; and to note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oi@@ a package must be installed at the appropriate distribution if this is not yet happened .
to store WAV files , the coding and the desired file format can be chosen . during the first opening , the entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) can be added to the coding . other coding can be added to this tab .
the coding package must be installed from the Linux distribution before the coding can be used before the coding is required . for more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer are in Chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a co@@ ach@@ ers , more information about his switch can be obtained via the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a tap@@ ered window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the names of the installed co@@ ach@@ ers .
this can be used by the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and readers of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) , try to retri@@ eve both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could be an indication of what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; read the cover of the &amp; CD ; check the h@@ ull of the &amp; CD ; this will not be gel@@ ingen !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this tips may give tips as you go .
you may read the complete manual , but it &apos;s still un@@ certain to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will make enough information that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , and we read the program for the first time . we are able to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ dic@@ ally ( tags ) .
it should be c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oi@@ a and l@@ ame to be installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled pack@@ et for your Linux distribution . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile your source files . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , what you can do of course .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you own write permission ( eg ; by using the quer@@ or to copy it with the pa@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section deals with basic entries of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; something which is probably done only once and
the second part describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; which has to be repeated for each of the selected &amp; CD ; repeat them .
here we determine the audio quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 - 256 k@@ bps ) and the resulting audio quality are used . since we are f@@ aul , we share a program that allows you to use &amp; CD to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet down .
even though we are able to change these settings at any time , we will likely not be able to change any &amp; CD ; if once the right settings are found .
the device name will be handed over to the check @-@ in program that can read &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
often / dev / CD@@ ROM is a symbolic link to the real device name . if this is not working or more than one &amp; CD / DVD drive , it can also be connected to the file / etc / f@@ rod and an attempt to connect with the existing entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the General Terms of General Settings . here is not much to do . here you can choose any additional transformation . in our example , everything will be displayed as shown in screen photo .
only At in@@ complete information , you choose that you will be informed if data are missing in the words of key@@ words ( tags ) .
the box map CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we can comfortably and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b interface .
note : the computer must be connected during the reading &amp; CD ; with the internet , it can be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is simple , a &amp; CD will be able to read it with a low @-@ risk file , and the file name may be easily changed . the directory or file name will be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; Add @-@ up and the ID3 tags of Ki@@ d@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , if you want to use this database , if you want to use the database before . however , this is worth up to 620 MB / s . if you want to use this is worth@@ while in the offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set on the map map .
CD@@ DB is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . this is necessary for the data on request for retri@@ eve the &amp; CD through the Internet . how knows how to get the system you will get the CD on fre@@ ed@@ b ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . do anything else as it is shown in screen photo .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we want to work with the remote database on the Internet Server .
CD@@ DB Server : please go on the site of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and look for a mirror server in your vicinity . this track will operate as first attempt on this road . however , this setting will work as first attempt .
both work does not work on the server , but many fire@@ walls of the protocol 88@@ 80 standard , is perhaps more fortun@@ ate with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to transfer &amp; CD ; data on the fre@@ ed@@ b servers should be enough .
simply take the settings of the screen photo . ( make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of sign@@ alled pieces : no debt , there is a reason why one reason why is more than one time ? parallel with only one existing drive ? parallel to reading and coding ? the author knows it not just trying to yourself .
CD ; after reading of the last piece : check this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you want to cross the file / folders may be useful if only space on one other drive is available . if you don &apos;t want to check the files in the private file , if you don &apos;t forget this folder when you want to make them something with the WAV files .
all this type , as it is on the screen photo . the command is something long , under circumstances must be smooth@@ ed to the right to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned before , it &apos;s a bit rate for high @-@ speed stereo modes . the compression factor is 6.3 mm . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage power consumption .
note the entry of &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1 &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 can be found on demand . if necessary , internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest such as in screen photo . some Comments for future use outside these examples :
number of simultaneously accessible WAV files : for a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad @-@ core or even one multi @-@ processor machine , more than a WAV file can be encoded at the same time .
that &apos;s what we have just finished the basic device of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; this configuration is used as standard for each of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music , you don &apos;t need to change it again .
in this section we will be described as the process of how the music is set up and set up on the hard disk . first in the previous section , we will be able to pick up the &amp; CD ; data from fre@@ ed@@ b will be described in this section . the process of this section is described in this section , must be repeated for every pivotal &amp; CD ;
because we are a &amp; CD which is not included in fre@@ ed@@ b , you don &apos;t see a bit differently than those for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn how to enter the &amp; CD ; data will need to pick up them on the Internet . comments are to be found on the differences .
try don &apos;t want to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this Hand@@ book .
if this is not happened , it must now be the &amp; CD ; in the drive , which is defined in the main window .
after a short moment the plays and their length of the window should be listed as shown in the screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD can be identified as Audio CD ; the audio CD can be read and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oi@@ a .
if this is not done , you are searching for questions or rep@@ lies after the help or go back to the previous section on the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD will be picked up by fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces have already filled and additionally displayed the name of the artist and the album .
for the case that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; you will select a window , and you can select the database entry , which fits your opinion the best on your &amp; CD ;
if you have not selected the check box for automatic request by fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for the settings ) , you can also select any local database , but data from the internet , you will need the connection to the Internet .
E 1.2 step 02 : the CD Editor - input of the CD data and Tit@@ els of the first unit
specify the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the samples on the next screen photo , the title of the unit in the first line of the input field &apos; updates &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist does not need to be entered at the &apos; Ac@@ eller title &apos; , unless you have a composition of various artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments of the album per piece , the comment field of the album will be used for comments on all pieces of the CD .
attention : according to the successful demand of the data from fre@@ ed@@ b , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors ( e.g. all words begin with large letters or not ... ) , but also to check whether it is any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you do not have an unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; max . this option will be set in the tab settings ; take a look into the section &apos; Basic settings &apos; .
you can change the day information from the files later anytime with the Tag Editor . Ki@@ d@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all coding and file formats . see you can see in the assistance to the code to obtain more information .
simply select an entry which is obvious in the style of the privilege . for more information , please check the &amp; CD &apos;s data . for more information on the site of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . Pop or Ra@@ p are available for example .
after the selection of &apos; OK , you come back to the main window . click on line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors appears again and you will see that the fields for the album is filled with the entered data . enter the entries for the fields of the actual unit . enter the title of the unit on any case and any other information you want .
click the next line in the main window and enter the same way up to you all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear , if you have downloaded the data from fre@@ ed@@ b . it is sorted into one of these categories .
it is the third button of the tool bar . note that the artist and the album on the product list will be displayed .
note that there are no check @-@ in before each line of a product . just the titles that are selected or out . make sure that all pieces are selected , or if you select the Conver@@ t . all tracks select at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces of the screen .
when clicking on the button , read the read@@ out process , this window will be published for confirmation . click on OK , and then we will take a look at the window with the insert and track .
click on the riders orders to the switch on the order panel . it is available in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool bar .
this is the window for the control of jobs . the first piece is read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the program in the status bar .
this error message you will try to work with a co@@ di@@ erer but do not have yet installed . pieces were encoded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the list of order .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target ord@@ ner are not what we are entered in the example . if you have writing access to the folders for temporary files and the destination ? ; - )
now it is clear , why the error occurs directly after the end of the first time .
the order 1 reads the first piece from it , but we have completed a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . to be read and coding in parallel . please note the status in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration setting to be able to read this behaviour , the number of parallel processes can be unc@@ le@@ ar . the installed computer with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to be no problem with simultaneous performance and coding ( from there two different pieces ) .
now , the last title is read , while another piece is encoded and is a third order in the waiting period . after the last piece is coded , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; , you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oi@@ a . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you will need the coding of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; now , when you see it with CV@@ S , you can download it with CV@@ S , as part of an important &amp; K@@ DE ; package , you can read the package k@@ dem@@ ti@@ media from your distribution . if you read this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is to be designed to comp@@ ile from source files , and not for users to use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for your needs to be adapted according to your needs , if it is at once , the following is correct for you :
a program that calls for many different programs , has many varieties of settings . best read the step for step Ex@@ ample of options and settings to learn . it shows the photos of different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
hi , still remember ? even if the help menu after start @-@ up time of the program is needed , no audio CD ( especially if the time of the program is not audio CD ; in the drive is ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what it does it ? who reads this , probably the program has already started . it should look something like :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t add this manual for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; but if you read it only after the contact intake of the author . and if you read this , it did not leave this section , and therefore they agree with this proposal .
strange , if you succeeded in closing the source file from &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N , then you need to get this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mi@@ de ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - und Kar@@ aoke Player of &amp; K@@ DE ; in addition to other , it has a real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke @-@ real high@@ lighting . lyrics also some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mi@@ de ; runs under &amp; Linux and FreeBSD . it builds on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; K@@ DE ; supported on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; K@@ DE ; also supports the &amp; Linux system ; Al@@ sa is supported , as soon as a sequ@@ encing for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is being supported as soon as a sequence .
&amp; k@@ mi@@ de ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing colour , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical display of the activity of any MIDI channel as a high@@ lighting of the pressed keys on the virtual ) keyboard .
Dra@@ g &amp; drop so that you can pull in &amp; K@@ DE ; each MIDI file from one &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window onto K@@ mid can withdraw .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( couch or texture ) . K@@ Mid is determined automatically the case each case .
seat support . if you finish &amp; K@@ DE ; during the play@@ ful of a song , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song once again .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select ... from the menu file . it appears to select the usual file dialog with the help you select the desired song .
you can also see a file from a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mi@@ de ; windows , this works also with several songs simultaneously .
to play an music piece , open it and operated the button on playing in the tool bar , select the entry from the menu piece from or operated the no .
please note that &amp; k@@ mi@@ de ; a piece automatically starts , once you draw on &amp; k@@ mi@@ de ; windows . ( in several pieces they will be added to a collection and then re@@ played by each other . )
once &amp; k@@ mi@@ de ; a piece of plays , you can jump to any place by using the mean mouse button , and drive along with the knob .
you will find that a song to quickly or too slow , you can change the arrows show on the left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ display , and so the reproduction speed can change again . in order to get the original pace , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the idle button has two tasks : if a piece is played by pressing a pressure on the button , or select the menu entry into the menu , i.e. , play the playback . if any piece is played , the space is played by no piece , &amp; k@@ mi@@ de ; the playback was done .
lyrics can be saved on two ways to be stored in a music piece . some pieces use texture , others use lyrics and again others . some pieces have not a text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mi@@ de ; you can adjust the events that need to set up a song , so you need to adjust the kar@@ aoke text , but if you want to adjust the kar@@ aoke text , but if you want to change the kar@@ aoke text , but if you want to change this way if you want to see the other type .
if you want to set a event in a event , select from the menu the entries for the entries or play out . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you can summ@@ ari@@ ze . these will be played by a row . in this section , how you can use collections of data .
to set up a collection , you will open the collection manager . here you will find the menu collection under the point .... click there to New and enter the name for the collection .
you may also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then click the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired page in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when installing the application , this collection will not be saved . concerns the when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . click here to add a song . it again appears to select the file dialogue with which help you select the desired song .
a second method to add a song , depends on the setup automatic to the collection .
if automatic adding to the collection is activated , a piece when opening ( using file opening or Dra@@ g &amp; drop ) automatically added to active collection .
when automation is not activated for the collection , it is activated , the opening of a product collection is activated and turned out . this collection will continue to be added to the temporary collection .
to remove a song from a collection , you &apos;ll need to open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removing .
you can select the order , in which the songs can be played . if you select the following menu after the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs will be played in sequence , as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove any random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ defined .
to add a song , select it in the collection manager or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump a song you go on , select the knob next song , the entry next thing from the menu or press the arrow right .
in order to jump back a song you go back , select the button pre @-@ end , record pre @-@ end pieces of the menu or press the arrow left .
in order to ext@@ ingu@@ ish a collection , open the collection manager , select the moving collection and click on the button .
the temporary collection can &apos;t be mistak@@ enly deleted . however , it doesn &apos;t matter what they cannot be saved by &amp; k@@ mi@@ de ; not saved .
this is necessarily necessary for Syn@@ thesi@@ zers , which are not general @-@ MIDI . in this case the MIDI @-@ map General @-@ MIDI events in events which under@@ stands the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the change Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the change Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and thus will always be a trumpet player when originally a piano .
if you have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound card GM is compatible ( incl . A@@ we and G@@ US @-@ cards , FM radio devices and so on ) .
there is unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps . so you have to edit the corresponding file of hand ( with your favourite se@@ d@@ itor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that saves all the required requirements for the play of a piece .
each section may only appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which is often appear as often . the condition is however , that every appearance is a different text ( see below ) .
DE@@ F@@ INE P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; An additional key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Op@@ tions ... EN@@ D
you see that DE@@ F@@ INE is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is reached .
please send us your map file as an e @-@ mail , so I can support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mi@@ de ; support can be used for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section will be specified , as the Pat@@ ches of General MIDI to your specific Key@@ board is shown as follows :
please note that the left side of the principle is ignored . it is assumed that GM -@@ Pat@@ ches are available in the correct sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) you may not change the order , and does not have a line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to convert all notes , which supports this instrument ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can choose a drum ( e.g. sound 60 ) , which like a sli@@ pper . to accomplish this , you wear the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
if you want to play a MIDI file with a patch 127 ( non @-@ def@@ enses ) , there &apos;s Patch 100 ( the drum on your Key@@ board ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that with the term Tro@@ mmel Patch , please note that any sound is a few perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ment instruments ( drum , tank , Marac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and no one that means sound the sound height of the always same drum means ( such as such a keyboard ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to specify how sounds can be seen on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
like the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of rows is very important , just as their availability . you must create 128 entries .
you can define for every channel and any instrument several keyboards . you have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly used to cut sounds on the per@@ tin@@ ent Canal . look for example the supplied Key@@ board .
this section can be used to cut some channels on the other hand . if you want to use the first and to the second channel , you will simply make the whole of the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards that have per@@ forman@@ t on a specific channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section , i.e. 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , constructed according to the pattern :
N is the channel that need to use on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map must be ignored , if you need to change the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events are ignored , which will try the patch on this channel . in this case you will always use patch x .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example , to use the per@@ tin@@ ent patch on the per@@ tin@@ ent Canal .
the value for the benchmark ratio is multip@@ lied by a P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der event . if a MIDI file is connected to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then forwar@@ ded by the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) , thus it is used in the map file no dec@@ im@@ al@@ mas ) .
this setting is needed because GM is necessary to play a keyboard with the value of 40@@ 96 . unfortunately , some keyboards will try to play two sounds up to a oc@@ tave higher . to find the correct value on your key@@ board , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mi@@ de ;
to use a MIDI map , open the dialog for MIDI settings . you can find in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole range of cla@@ vi@@ ds ( one for every MIDI channel ) . click on this pi@@ anos , which can be played by notes .
you can also use the channel view to modify the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a select list where you have a instrument , the button does not have green , but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to show the played sounds . the view of the menu adjustments under the point @-@ view : settings
pace LCD display shows the speed to play with the one song . higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a couch by changing a song . for example , you &apos;ll find a song to follow the text , you can change it slow . to change the pace , use the arrows turn left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc ; so that the same MIDI file can lead to two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes on very different ways .
good , I can use ni@@ em@@ anden , &amp; k@@ mi@@ de ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while you can change a similar sound quality . with a MIDI file , you can change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have the control over everything .
this may happen when you have a Bin@@ är@@ s ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mi@@ de ; without AW@@ E support , you need to eliminate any source code and install a source file ( for example from k@@ mi@@ de ; &apos;s Start@@ page )
I want to add a whole file to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately .
however , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mi@@ de ; Dra@@ g &amp; drop . open the folder which you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; choose all files from you , and draw it to the &amp; k@@ mi@@ de ; window .
keep in advance the adjustment of automatic adding to the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can select the arrow button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow the playback . in order to add the standard tempo , you can click on the LCD double click .
I &apos;m on a &amp; K@@ DE ; works with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mi@@ de ; if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file , or I would like to play a file to play only in the &amp; cont@@ quer@@ or ; window changes and the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mi@@ de ;
if you want to listen to a file , without having to add more to a collection , turn off the adjustment automatic to the collection , and the new ; file will open to the temporary collection .
supp@@ ose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ C and C.@@ mi@@ d. you only want to play the first file . so , adjust the adjustment to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection , then exactly this one MIDI file .
then join the B.@@ mi@@ de and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you make this ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you ! if I see these songs or the postcard , animated me further to &amp; k@@ mi@@ de ; program I see these songs .

&amp; k@@ m@@ player is a simple interface for MP@@ player , ph@@ ono and ff@@ m@@ peg . this program is needed for playback of video files from MP@@ player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats as well as for playback of DVD , VCD or TV and camera .
the documentation of &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished when &amp; K@@ DE was installed on this machine .
for additional aid , please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or the question on The &amp; K@@ DE ; User Mail@@ ing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . here is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is a information window which will be displayed only if the information is re@@ scheduled .
it is possible to add the preferred connections among the menu mark , but this is individual entries if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , so you should use the category thum@@ b playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional release , and will love his group and all its sub@@ groups to the current category and play the playback starts with the adjusted entry .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , television and a permanent playlist can be modified , but can also be modified by an editor , but also by the use of a category cli@@ max , on the menu view , and next to the process control mode . due to the click of a sub@@ group , the XML content is displayed in the file .
after changing XML files , you need to be selected from the menu of the same playlist and select either the processing mode , or select a different category .
all changes are lost if the processing mode is left or another group will be selected without the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched by using the XML configuration files .
the animation during St@@ arten and Be@@ ing can be disabled by editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c and Change from &#91; general Op@@ tions &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger &apos; option &apos; . if the option is not available , it can easily be inserted .
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player is also possible to activate the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / other ml / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ m@@ ml . the format must be aware of a supported XML file .
the animation during St@@ arten don &apos;t need to be too short , it will automatically termin@@ ated by opening a different source . this would be anno@@ ying with the end @-@ animation , the user can end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation may be added ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g ; &amp; lt ; / ME : / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; / s@@ mil@@ ed ; In the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; In list tests / some examples of S@@ connectors are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player .
there is a rider to the configuration of MP@@ player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player . here , the path can be set by the MP@@ s and the intermediate storage size of the Dat@@ enst@@ ro@@ ms from the network and other things .
another tool for troub@@ lesho@@ oting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of MP@@ player .
there is no riders for this return device in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player . everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the Module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa :
&apos; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player . it can even be added to the special box for YouTube in the playlist XML .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player has to be used as a service provider for the M@@ ime Type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog for file extension of K@@ DE .
the cross @-@ section or &amp; k@@ m@@ player is in a consoles to use and error messages on the loading of the browser &apos;s library . if there is no error occur , the back@@ end output is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
this means a specified back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime Type ( of course only if this was determined ) , this must be done by manual modification of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c . for example , phon@@ o will play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ player can play with TV cards , either by means of the MP@@ player or X@@ video ( this need k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . if you need to use TV channels , the sc@@ anners can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog box is to be detected . there are ports be detected , from which one will be selected . for example , it must be found PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name has probably included a DVB t .
because the V@@ DR support from k@@ m@@ player can only work on the Linux server . this type is also supported on the X server . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , it must therefore be included in the configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally are used by K@@ MP@@ player for the sources of various name . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , dv@@ d@@ source , source source , source source , source source , source source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , and v@@ dr@@ source . if you are activated , they begin playing the playlist of the playlist .
are you how to make my CD@@ ROM drive , if I play a game ( not from VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / CD@@ ROM is as user root according to the device &apos;s device . to ensure that / dev / CD@@ ROM shows the CD@@ ROM drive to the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts only slowly , why shouldn &apos;t have to be tested my CPU on their performance ?

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ ile of &amp; k@@ ile ;
Lat@@ ex ; : a professional font application . under Unix @-@ like systems probably used on the package &amp; tex@@ tured ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be used on the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , the distribution of the Distribution and installer CD can be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ ile , and are included on the k@@ ile ; website .
this manual is suitable for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; Lat@@ ex ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ;
advanced users don &apos;t have to read this manual . however , all proposals for documentation is taken into account . however , the support for this project or documentary , should be carried out by contact via the k@@ ile ; website .
if any questions or related to the comp@@ ile of &amp; k@@ ile , your extensions should be addressed at the mail@@ ing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

for Lat@@ ex &amp; Lat@@ ex ; it is difficult to use &amp; tex ; it is difficult to use a La@@ ex ( English . L@@ ay ) &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros . a less demanding but realistic to be noted that it comes from the desc@@ endant of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .

you can see how other source code editors - as well as other source code editors ( e.g. , the high@@ lighting ) of a gr@@ assy area is not closed . however , it is still noticed by the modest appearance of the output file . however , you can save time through the high@@ lighting time and un@@ lock .
with the automatic installation of the environments , for entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ ) { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile , an empty line ( for input of the text ) and an empty line ( e.g. \ \ in { command } ) . this function can be activated in the menu of the unit , set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are divided in some elements . &amp; Lat@@ ex ; the sub@@ element of the document can be found in the following elements ( part is the h@@ Ã ¶ ste and sub@@ mer@@ ging ) :
with the view of the document in structural view , the individual elements could be changed by a mouse click on the respective and relevant individual elements .
if the creation of the own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be done very helpful . once a DVI ; file is necessary , navigating immediately to a click with the one @-@ mouse button in the DVI ; viewing for the respective row in the Lat@@ ex and Lat@@ ex ; source text .
a DVI ; file extension is a description of the format document and also other information such as the font and is in addition to PDF the storage output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; Lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for view , conversion and print of DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the box , the elements of the DVI ; file , the elements of the DVI ; file @-@ fil@@ tered is the same part . as soon as part of this section , as soon as part of a section in the Lat@@ ex and Lat@@ ex ; source text , it is used for the relevant part in a DVI ; viewer .
master document : this function is used to work with several files . using a Master document , the work will be simplified using other involved .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project can be set up a project @-@ wide master document project settings .
quick installation : the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; source text is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless no error in the source text ) .
file route monitoring : in this mode the DVI ; file is on the same as well as the de@@ cel@@ er@@ cal â s ... and there is no call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; according to the rapid building .
during preparation of the machine tool bar , the three large number of common elements were developed into the document . the first selection box is designed for the document of the document in parts , chapter , sections , ... The ver@@ itable &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands of the classification :
the wide box transfer is for mounting of articles such as key@@ words , Fu@@ Ã ¶ notes or Ver@@ tical . available in March :
description : this command will be a description of a description for a section , a picture or different element .
terms of reference : is used for reference to a defined description ( selection of a selection box possible ) .
when using the quot@@ ation is displayed . for &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex , this is only if the file is necessary for a project . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files and enables you to place in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the last selection box with the name of Gr@@ Ã ¶ e is being used for the font of the text . it enables you to place the fon@@ due to the main text , the Fu@@ Ã e notes , etc . , the following commands are available for recovery :
when the call of &amp; k@@ ile , two selection of a selection of documentation : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document through selection of the document and fixed installations . 2 . the document can be written by the hand .
the bra@@ ckets according to the command \ \ &apos; s contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ 83 &#93; puts the font . if the font is not specified , this is not specified in the text .
once the above source code example was entered , the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; source text was compiled . the easi@@ est way to use the men@@ Ã ¼ s Bau@@ en or the Kn@@ op@@ fs Schnell@@ bau .
the source code needs to be stored before the comp@@ ile . &amp; k@@ ile , the storage will be done automatically .
the document of the document should be sought after the fault . when using quick charging should be sought &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; if the case is not started . if the case is not the case , the case should be deduc@@ ted .
for example , a text ( English environment ) is a text which is different than the rest document . for example , a report with the command \ \ \ &apos; s } , \ \ \ &apos; and \ \ &apos; } went to the environment . therefore , the command of the let@@ ter@@ Ã ¶ po@@ ds within the environment â s Ries@@ ig@@ â s ... &quot; ( English ) .
the conditions are incub@@ ated within the surrounding area ( from \ \ ) { to \ \ &apos; ( Environment } ) , however , there is no obj@@ ections ( number ) for the treatment within a surroundings .
there are many places to prevent the reading and user @-@ friendliness of the document . it enables you to place certain types , fat pressure , curi@@ osity , sub@@ missions , etc . , these commands can either be done with the command \ \ &apos; or automatically at the end of the surrounding area .
\ \ &apos; { emp@@ h } : this command is for the spa pressure and is as long as long as it is closed , until he is closed with \ \ &apos; { emp@@ h } or another environment . one single word can be repeated in a set with \ \ &apos; { word } .
\ \ mark : created a quot@@ ation in the document . the quot@@ ation starts with \ \ &apos; { ratio } and ends with \ \ in { ratio } .
after the background to write the source text by the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; the recording was shown , follows a step @-@ by @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ;
once in the assistant , a bit text should be entered , a few customi@@ zations should be carried out for the better reading of the document . should be min@@ d. a quot@@ ation , a few positions in the fat and spa pressure and a po@@ em to use to see the differences of these commands .
as soon as the document was considered , the Editor @-@ view or Str@@ g E can be turned to the editor ( for internal viewer ) , and the window must be closed with an external viewer .
once the DVI ; file is created , the document can be printed or in a &amp; PostScript ; / PDF file can be converted . simple and work .
DVI ; if the files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; Lat@@ ex . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; Lat@@ ex ; for the reading of a few drivers of the computer &apos;s performance . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi edition such as printers , &amp; PostScript ; / PDF -@@ convertible and computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps are as for the preparation of the document ( see ) . during the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - it can be printed ( if the printer is set correctly ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was created , the conversion was able to recover other formats by means of the button in the tool bar .
the pre @-@ looking forward fully fitted with the direct jump of the editor for their respective position within the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a corresponding adjustment for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; and it must be used only Modern under the settings of K@@ ile , including tools and tools .
in order to search for the pre @-@ looking forward , the mouse po@@ ds must be positioned in a line of the source text , and then enter the go for the appropriate place in a DVI ; viewer is then done .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , with one click of the Middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; Lat@@ ex ; No@@ k@@ ile : do not need &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as a text editor ( settings the ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if the use of the installation of the &amp; DVI ; viewing does not have access to a mistake , a bug can be found in the prototypes or in the news window in the news window .
the fault file cl@@ adding to the source code in the source code . the fault file does not appear on the error . in order to consider the incorrect line . in order to consider the faul@@ ty line , the error occurs on the error in the gri@@ es and &amp; k@@ ile , navigating immediately to the incorrect line .
once you click on the appropriate button in the tool bar , a window will appear on the selection of the same model for the document . the pre @-@ pre @-@ termin@@ ated cap are :
in selecting a blank document , a document can be re@@ written either from a new document or to the fast preparation of a new document . additional information are included in the section .
customer user of &amp; Lat@@ ex ; usually , the same introduction for almost all documents . templates to be stored in &amp; k@@ ile ; they are stored and loaded up to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template ; either an existing &amp; tex ; - / Lat@@ ex ; file can be created or created a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new model by means of an existing document and selection of file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a template using file New will be replaced by other data ( such as name or character codes ) . these variables enables you to set up to your settings for Settings and Settings .
when creating the own model , it is therefore necessary to know what strings of which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ L@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ : this drawing chain is replaced by input in the document . typically , \ \ in class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ L@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easi@@ est way to create a template is the use of the assistance and the entry for the commands in the editor . once the document has been converted into this way :
when creating a new document , the own model can be used instead of the standard equipment instead of the standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files are created . if a simple way is searching for creating a template , should be sought after one in the internet , and below the steps below .
&amp; K@@ ate ; used as internal editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; a text editor for program@@ mer with the read@@ ability of the reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; Lat@@ ex ; und &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings are added to &amp; K@@ ate ; you can be added to the menu of tools directly from &amp; k@@ ile ;
to learn more about 1 &amp; K@@ ate ; and its possible to learn the manual of K@@ ate . users of &amp; k@@ ile , you can also see it directly to the reading of the chapter with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; this enables you to place .
&amp; k@@ ile , a very practical and lat@@ ex ; also offers a very practical and lat@@ ex ; it can be called for a description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; use enables you to place and its syn@@ tax .
a double @-@ click with dr@@ unk Str@@ g button to view the &amp; tex ; this means that the click on the click on \ \ par \ \ \ ski@@ p only \ \ par used on this way .
when searching the text @-@ mounted mouse button , the text button will automatically copied automatically into the intermediate position .
when using the arrow keys , you can pick @-@ up parts of the source text in the editorial window .
&amp; k@@ ile , the MÃ ¶ ability of the most diverse types of sources to browse these categories . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from the normal text and the mathematical models are caused by another color .
many assist@@ ants enables you to place a number of entries within the text . the volume of the price has the jump to the native or last spr@@ int brand . this is the number of jump brand , so that it will automatically be automatic on the first input of a character .
the editing is probably one of the major trans@@ formations in the uses of a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; nevertheless , &amp; K@@ ate has been added to the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special functions for writing &amp; be@@ ile , special commands for their selection . under editing , the following commands are included in the following code :
W@@ Ã ¤ t includes a complete section ( group of lines that are included on both sides ) . with a paragraph is not a text that can be found on both sides , and lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . this is the only prev@@ entive thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; this means that the community can be separated by two le@@ ere rows .
please use the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this option also has an extended importance , since this command also has a lat@@ ex ; commands with one lap times ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to top of a document the document can be removed and replaced by dr@@ one button . &amp; K@@ ate , the keyboard can be removed from here . &amp; k@@ ile , the following commands includes a faster entry . under edit and removing it , the following commands are included in the text of the text :
this is a complete paragraph . the definition of a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile is included in the description of editing .
it was already clear that environments is a central role in &amp; Lat@@ ex . that &apos;s why &amp; k@@ ile is why &amp; k@@ ile is now offering for further commands among editing , for a fully fitted simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex .
with this command , for the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) , the cur@@ sor is placed directly before the command to the surrounding area .
with this command will be pr@@ isons to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to shr@@ ubs .
if the cur@@ sor is placed before or within the command \ \ in { surroundings } , the cur@@ sor is buried in the end of the environment ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
if the input of many ne@@ sted ambient temperature can be lost quickly . this command will close the most recently opened environment , so the living environment structure is not attached to the surrounding area .
&amp; k@@ ile , also special commands for the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by cl@@ amps { ... } . under the Te@@ X group are a few important commands that meet from editing .
with this command , the cur@@ sor will be placed at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the cart@@ on .
this command will be placed at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the wei@@ ght@@ ful place .
when the cur@@ sor is placed before or behind the sli@@ ps of a &amp; tex ; group # is , the other end of the group ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
with the input of many ne@@ sted groups @-@ bra@@ ckets in the input of many ne@@ sted groups can be lost , so the most recently opened structure of the &amp; tex @-@ groups will not be attached as the result of this command .
in &amp; Lat@@ ex , two simple initial letters are used in &amp; k@@ ile , the sign &quot; for two simple initial letters will be used . &quot; &amp; k@@ ile , &quot; this case is known for this case and for two close connections , starting point for Lat@@ ex and Lat@@ ex .
this automatic single point of view of the double initial letters can be set under the settings of K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X traffic .
it enables you to place your way @-@ specific settings ( e. g. n@@ ap or French ) and so that German or French speaking , you can also be used for many other languages .
at the top of Shift ; input button of plan@@ ets ; if the current position within a lists ( for example en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ emi@@ ze ) is ready for use &amp; k@@ ile ; not only a goat , but at the same time the command \ \ item is one .
within a table @-@ environment , t &amp; k@@ ile , the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; close to the sp@@ inal cord .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile , intelligent enough to accommodate default and lat@@ ex ; or user @-@ defined environments are required to use . this enables you to set up separately on settings ; ... La@@ Te@@ X will be added .
some users are able to arrange the columns in tables all tables ; even if this tabernacle is to be fitted in the same row . although this Tab@@ ulator is not possible to reach &amp; k@@ ile ; some intermediate space for the columns of the current tab@@ ul@@ ators are added .
although &amp; K@@ ate has already been extended . although there are already a good source code fully . it is available for various modes ( mostly for stock &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) there are three modes for the automatic period of work . all of these Mo@@ di enables you to set up a variety of work under the settings of K@@ ile ...
at the beginning of a new environment by the command \ \ in { surroundings } &amp; k@@ ile , automatically the command \ \ in { environment } is added after a empty line ( for the text ) .
at the Dr@@ Ã ¼ t button , the last letter of the input is removed and , this allows the fully @-@ part list . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by a letter of other letters .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , you can open the descriptions of &amp; k@@ ile , the descriptions of the time that a simple jump on these positions can be fitted with a jump brand N@@ Ã ¼ in jump brand , and the desired parameter will be added to you .
you can set up to these lists . you can be added to these lists . it enables you to place various vot@@ ers ( for &amp; tex ; - und &amp; Lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Lat@@ ex ; commands , as well as W@@ Ã ¶ ter@@ ns ) .
the command @-@ mode is not relevant for the fully operational environments . there are always a large number of letters with \ \ &apos; s . on the other hand , the environments are so often used , &amp; k@@ ile , a special mode for the fully operational environments for finishing the environments .
when running the site , the unit is automatically adapted for the use of the surrounding area or the button of the surrounding area , and it appears to be used for \ \ &apos; . afterwards , the ambient temperature can be continued on the sim@@ pl@@ est way and way through Dr@@ Ã ¼ t the input .
after this is closed , the environment will automatically shut down again . once &amp; k@@ ile it recognizes that there is a lists of \ \ item that is still a first \ \ item command .
you can set up to these lists . you can also be added to these lists . this mode uses the delay list of the fully operational mode for &amp; tex ; and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
the lists enables you to replace the lists of the settings for you . the lists enables you to set up on the settings of K@@ ile , for example , for example , the file is ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l which is included in the example of the L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
for example , the letters e L will be entered and the word on this site , the volume is replaced with fully conver@@ sions , or the button 1 Alt let + Alt @-@ button is replaced by the character chain \ \ La@@ Te@@ X where the string is replaced by the string \ La@@ Te@@ X .
very large living rooms are not useful . however , it has been found that many occasions can be written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ile , the fully conver@@ sions of all meals are already written .
this mode can be set up in the menu of the unit K@@ ile ... K@@ ile Ver@@ fully automatically . here , the swelling value can also be specified for the display of the fully conver@@ sions .
the fully operational files enables you to place to place in the sub@@ ord@@ ner ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / Vista / k@@ ile / Complete / dresser / the Per@@ s@@ Ã ¶ n@@ able home @-@ ordination . mode is for de@@ centr@@ ation ( descent ) and tex ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the dialogue graphics is designed for graphics by graphics as easy as possible . to the view of the fundament@@ als to the graphics formats , the sections should be eff@@ ected .
PS -@@ files are not so known as PDF files , but we offer an excellent basis for the relevant industry , and enables you to place the pages with a few &amp; PostScript ; tools are newly arranged and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
in order to avoid the result of the work , you need to comp@@ ile the source code . all tools in construction tools are comp@@ ile in the menu of equipment , converting , converting , and open view .
for the comp@@ ile of the source text for viewing , such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , or the other conversion can be used by using Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file can be converted into one PS file and by using Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed .
when using the deployment of a quick release , a viewer can be called upon to comp@@ ile . should no built @-@ in turn , there will be a new window .
a new project is provided by the men@@ Ã ¼ Project New Project .... Hier@@ on are asked the following information for the project :

version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML , tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools are available as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ sl@@ t as base . the combination is fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everybody who worked with the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation is known that my pro@@ c and how over@@ the outstanding it is . keep it still a graphical interface ! not more on a terminal ; just the icon for the XML processor are finished and finished !
this application is an index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is set up in the working work . if not , remove the selection of current work and enter the files in the box of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time when my pro@@ c is started .
as we said , anyone who has been working on the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful these application . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphics surface for this .
if the only opened file index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is then necessary to select the current work folders . if not , then select the current work , and give them the folders to find an index@@ .@@ doc@@ book .
when it comes to a copy on the screen , your file is incorrect . please check the mistakes and try them again .
if the checks of the file is marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if you don &apos;t delete the current file . if not , delete them in current file the Hä@@ k@@ ite file and select the file format using other file - file selection .
if it only want to know whether the file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed review .
for use of a &amp; D@@ TD ; it is specified in the &amp; XML file ( default ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( default ) , select &amp; D@@ TD ; with defini@@ tions for both the &amp; W@@ 3C ; and XML as well as for the re@@ ax@@ NG review , the specification of the defini@@ tions UR@@ I , is required in the file selection .
ja@@ ly , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tools ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if you should be a processed file in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if you don &apos;t remove the current file . if not , remove the selection of current file and select them the file @-@ to @-@ use file using the other file extensions .
enter the name of the file , as the result is named , the result is supposed to be stored in their hometown .
Plu@@ gins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is very powerful . the plug@@ in system is very powerful . this allows you to use the desired functionality in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; the plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; more on the other .
to install a plug@@ in or another part , we begin with the menu Plu@@ gins editing . this will open the following dialogue :
this dialogue allows to manage all of the plug@@ ins to manage and add new . we describe any &amp; GUI ; element :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage place or qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to searching for plug@@ ins .
many people are working on a project of hierarch@@ ical relationship with a hierarch@@ ical relationship . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project @-@ properties -@@ dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nickel name is the top name of the user and serves for the unique identification .
a member may have several roles within the project , as well as sub@@ project managers .
the user can search for himself from the list of the team members , who is looking for the team member and press the button . currently , it is a member of the list selected ( their identification ) appears on the way they are : text .
top name and the setting of your own identity are important in respect of news and comments . see for further information .
in addition to an overview of her team , there is another advantage through the capture of members of the team : it can be created for information to the team leader , if something special happens . see for further information .
event actions will be carried out , which will be carried out if something particular will happen in this project , or how much if someone could happen , if a file is secured , or a script that will play a file into CV@@ S once they will be added to the project , etc ;
on the side configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project settings dialog can be created , processed and deleted .
an email will be sent to the receiver list selected address in the receiver list . the address sat can be set up a team or sub@@ project leader . see in , wei shows such conductors .
comments are special comments in documents . they differ from normal commentary by the following things :
remarks is simply a note . it can be selected either in the editor @-@ text menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary range followed by comments Paper .
comments can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syn@@ tax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , a role in the following ways : team head of the head of Sub@@ project managers to en@@ riches and sub@@ project names , as well as sub@@ project names , as in the following examples .
top name and roles names are independent of big or small dish , but spaces to the cl@@ amps , and the note are the note .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scripts and mol@@ ati@@ fication languages , supported by D@@ TD @-@ based table and web@@ based mol@@ ati@@ fication and scripts .
the settings are accessible via the settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the files you can be found in .
the settings can be accessed by query Qu@@ anta ... they are called on a few pages which are treated with each other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; on tags including car support can be changed . the entries are :
big / inf@@ ants of tags : large / inf@@ ants of automatically enabled tags . normal Great / small dish means that the tags are added , as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / small dish of attributes : large / small dish of automatically detected . normal Great / small dish means that attributes are added to the attributes , as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags : if you re @-@ act , the tag is optional , for which the exclusive day is optional , that is immediately add .
not optional tags : how above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
start and end @-@ day automatically update : if switched , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice vers@@ a .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent signs : controls the automatic transformation of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters to the corresponding encoding during the ti@@ pping .
M@@ IM@@ E types : m@@ imet@@ ypes for detection of various kinds of files . using the button , the standard specification can be restored .
standard character codes : the encoding of new created or in other way than with file opening files ( where the encoding of the file can be saved ) , but this setting is loaded by the same into the project features , if a project is charged .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for re@@ designed files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . this setting will be loaded by the same into the project features , if a project is charged .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a backup copy can be restored using this document because of a power failure or crash in the next start of the program . this is not the same as the memory of the file . also for even saved documents , it is saved regularly , according to the specified time .
the preview and documentation can be represented either in the editors or a separate view ( or the documentation in a cart@@ on ) which makes it possible to check the documentation , preview and source code .
set the window in the next start when the user interface is useful when the user &apos;s interface changed by the M@@ DI @-@ Mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cken / depending on the other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning messages also serves the taxes of the option to switch the display of war@@ nings by an@@ h@@ aken from non more questions .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; VP@@ L ; it can change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text @-@ view in the split mode . with regard to different modes .
here you can find the par@@ ser and structural tree that represents the figure of the par@@ ser node in the document , in details .
in the area of mouse click on the structural tree in the following action , it is possible to change the structure of the structural design with the mouse buttons .
in a tree to structural change , the visibility of knot@@ s is automatically opened at the tree , and how deep at a change of structural change will be set automatically . if one node are the empty areas in the text , while performing groups such are no element in the actual document no element .
the range for a shortened text may be folded ( a type of templates ) that can be shared by editing . this means a valid group of PHP will be valid for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ ab will be somewhat different means a group is valid for Jav@@ as@@ cri@@ pt .
here , plug@@ ins can be managed by plug@@ ins . plug@@ ins can be used by the third page that can be used by any type of part applications :
address : the path to Plu@@ gin , if there is not on a standard there like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information will start the plug@@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the associated file ( path of the current file ) or the project ord@@ ner .
component in the &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in is ref@@ using to the loading . only if read @-@ read , if this option is not selected , if this option is not chosen .
check the plug@@ in : is this is activated , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the specified information is right , then the memory in the application is not available , but if the plug@@ in at the moment is not available , but it is later to be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the troub@@ lesho@@ oting has been completely re @-@ developed and does support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger , as well as support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in concept was implemented , which enables different implantation of plug@@ ins via Plu@@ gins .
currently , only a plug@@ in is available , supporting the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; gra@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is inserted .
the use of the Deb@@ ug@@ gers for a project starts with the selection of a matching de@@ bug@@ ger plug @-@ ins in the project settings . in addition to the button options , the specific settings can be changed .
if a project is activated , a de@@ bug@@ ger is activated , some additional elements in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface :
a view , in which the content of higher variables is indicated . usually , usually in the left @-@ hand dock .
a view , in all holding points , with Z@@ eil@@ en@@ numbers and conditions are listed . usually in the lower Dock .
a view is shown in the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bug@@ gers . usually , usually in the lower Dock .
depending on the supported functions of the debate , everything or part of the following features are available .
with this promotion , the de@@ bug@@ ger will be made , if necessary , or to listen to the plug@@ in . this promotion is triggered by default when a project is being used , so that a de@@ bug@@ ger is used , so that it must not be insist@@ ed on the normal case .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen meeting starts the session . includes the link to the de@@ bu@@ ger or finished the ar@@ ches after the requirements .
it sends a HTTP requirement to the server to set a Deb@@ ug requirement . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to see the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the view of Deb@@ ug@@ ger output .
once again , the Deb@@ ug@@ ger begin to begin with the execution of the scripts and the currently selected line as well as to follow the script will be continued until the script will start before the script will start before the script will start with the requirement .
if this is the de@@ bug@@ ger to begin with the execution of the scripts , and if this happens , while a script will continue until a script will be given before a debate was set before , as soon as an requirement is set out .
the de@@ bu@@ ger leads the next order in the script , without taking into the functions or process .
the de@@ bu@@ ger leads the next order in the script , whereby if possible in functions and set @-@ up files .
with the de@@ bug@@ ger to go to the order , and go to the next so , when the current did not go .
opens a dialogue in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which is monitored regularly . the stored value appears in the variation of variation .
with this dialog , a variable record can be entered or a new value of a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l is a work of Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of documentation . it is a &amp; K@@ DE ; front @-@ end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g , that they can find on htt@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net to find many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you can adapt to your needs and can help you want to be better .
docum@@ enting editing ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; its simplicity and flexibility are made of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user friendly &amp; IDE ; for Web developers , easy to use and productive users .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s is available in two types , family 1 , the market @-@ up languages and family files . day file containing two types of file types including file descri@@ p@@ ure@@ .@@ s ( above the Edi@@ tier F@@ enst@@ ers ) , the text and instructions can be set fast in a document as a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be used manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details of converting .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML @-@ files are to create , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c , and also tool bar . shortly , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ;
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes and the contents of the property , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day it shows the rules and information about the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; the tool bar also allow a quick change of tags in a document without a risk .
day file is nothing as a folder . you contain only the &amp; file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML file . day file bear the name of the labelling language and version , so present . ( for example , ht@@ ml @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use so many as possible , so other users have a better view and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in individual types . everything concerning the possibilities and limits are placed in simple way .
this is the root element of a day file document . it can only contain only once in a document where it can contain definition of many tags , but it does not contain any type of element that is nothing else .
the type of tags is a script @-@ function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
only for the day of Day Class . the name of the base class is valid for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the Type Method . gives the names of the Class , where this method belongs to . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attributes and the attributes within this tags may be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
puts a text in the dialog box . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day . this is an only element type element .
this element is a reference to a tags . this element can only describe the names and the type of the attributes . additionally , it contains further tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; this is an only element @-@ type element .
there is the source text to fill out the source text for the attributes in the day @-@ Edit@@ or@@ acle and in the attributes @-@ tree to
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface is used within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if reaching the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of a interface . the d@@ co@@ p method@@ ology is used within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is used for creating data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface , and a method name . arguments that can be handed over to the method . may be empty , his or % day@@ name % , which means the name of the actual tags .
a tank day put together the elements of a list . it can only occur only once . it is a only element of element element .
sets the position of the attributes in a dialogue within a dialogue . this day can only occur in a dialogue only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and the size of a field in dialogue . this day should be available for each box in the dialog box ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ) ( label &gt; day ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may be allowed within the listed tags . this element is an only element type .
gives a list of elements to finish a day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML file system : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 card = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ne@@ at@@ ly , and closed .
spaces contain nothing but do not pay attention &amp; lt ; it should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; they should be replaced by &amp; lt ; Tool@@ bar &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not be replaced , but some pieces of work would be disappear .
to review the Tag@@ XML @-@ files is the tools dialog in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window will start and tested Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . currently , the verification only occurs during charging of the Tag@@ XML @-@ files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file , this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; -@@ element of the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . fil@@ en@@ ame for this day file would be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example for a working family 2 @-@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ charge function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file is supposed to be over@@ taking .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; 1.0 &quot; ( = &quot; ) &quot; = &quot; &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; &quot; = &gt; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; = &quot; = &quot; = &quot; = &quot; = &quot; = &quot; = &quot; = &quot; = &quot; = &quot; = &quot; = &quot; = &quot; string &quot; = &quot; option = &gt; &quot; option &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c , it is rather pretty easy and there is a editor to be used via D@@ TD . for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it should be created and created a simple &amp; file descri@@ p@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = = 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD specification . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ i = The simplified name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as Nick@@ i name .
an action can be set with the actions of the settings . click on new promotion to the same dialogue :
this promotion can be assigned to the button . by clicking the button , the keyboard can be assigned to a button , the current keyboard can be removable .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered in the detailed settings in the detailed settings of the document , this text is inserted at the actual cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful shareholders . with the help of this promotion , it is not limited to use ( or parts of the document ) , it is not limited . examples of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the quick start @-@ up dialog , or the different ones in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ EP@@ s .
as the first , the name of the scripts and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are recommended , it is recommended to use the % off the variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / course in your path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replaced with the URL of the current documentation . in the case of a local document it is file : / out of the document name .
% pid is being replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is available , the text series is inserted at P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the remote script will be used by the external script .
the parameter for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the contrary methods , a script will be possible by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; on the standard settings . in the category input can be determined , which is to send to standard settings . possibilities :
selected text : the selected area of the document will be sent to the script . the % input is typically only meaning@@ ful with this setting .
according to the input , the issue of the issue can be re@@ directed . there are two types of edition : normal edition , to be written on standard error issue . it may be specified , which shall be done with the default output by the value of the selection box :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group . in the case they are not quite different , therefore one can create a tool bar with the name of the market @-@ ups .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add campaigns and configure the promotions . select the actions of the actions .
the parts of this type are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom end of the window , editing mode .
fill all the necessary fields and add it the day for the right tool bar .
complete everything and , if the day At@@ tor@@ so , and you are planning to edit the dialog box &quot; day , &quot; if available , so a input at the promotion is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is a symbol symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? we replace it before we have trouble .
for creating a symbol that the action will be better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ fer : choose from the &amp; k@@ men@@ ù ; , graphics , more programs ( or where else it is situated in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ fer , used as standard 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose edit size and others .
please note that the created symbol does not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ;
in terms of mind that day is , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . however , the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as los , star@@ te , even further ) , or should at least , a message for users shall be put on this symbol ; if a day is put in the current document ;
after creating a symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this occurs via the menu with the actions of the settings . ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired promotion . in addition to the text field there is a button , press it .
in the folder , select the files stored in which the stored symbol is , select it and confirm you with OK .
press the application button and put it with other tags , so it &apos;s still that you are OK or confirm you with OK .
supp@@ ose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions for the tool bar or it should be shared to a better overview by some Tren@@ ner in several groups . open the tool bar dialog for Settings . make sure that the required tool bar is selected .
I want to select the Tren@@ ner ( quite left ) for my tool bar . after the selection of the element which is added to the tool bar , press the arrow button to the right . this add the element to the tool bar .
I want to add a fast way to access the cross @-@ cross section . I will select and add it to the tool bar .
please note like Tren@@ ner support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool bar , could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; button on the opposite of the start @-@ up is .
the new tool bar must be tested by pro@@ ps all symbols to ensure that everything works .
secure in the real file . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the real folder but your tool bar must be loaded when your tool bar is charged ( n ) , if a file is open ( n ) , if a file is open .
perhaps the chosen expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the shape language which you like this chapter , how I describes a &amp; PHP , document tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; repository check whether someone has already done for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . first part we left you to treat the second .
# K@@ DE Con@@ text file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c you = path , relatively 1 , day 2 , tag@@ 1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ ht@@ ml Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ ht@@ ml Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ ht@@ ml = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ ht@@ ml = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ ht@@ ml tag@@ 1 = day 1.@@ ht@@ ml day@@ 1 = tag@@ on@@ 1 = day 2.@@ ht@@ ml day@@ time 3 = day 3.@@ ht@@ ml
the section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so something :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c Docum@@ entation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # G@@ etting Start@@ ed = regulation .@@ ht@@ ml G@@ etting Start@@ ed = Basic syn@@ tax , ... Basic syn@@ tax = Basic syn@@ tax = .@@ ht@@ ml ...
please note # # G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language reference . this is showing that it is a sub@@ ord@@ ner in tree with its own contents . there is no known limit for chess of deep deep ( except for understanding ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try them out .
note that the contents of contents directly is refer@@ enced to a file ( and consistent with the upper end of the structure &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces contain nothing but pay attention to &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the c@@ end@@ at@@ eries will be replaced .
the contents of the content of the context is sensitive to context sensitive help . for example , if writing on the m@@ ys@@ q@@ l _ fet@@ ch _ array can be displayed . by mark@@ ings the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context @-@ text list ( Con@@ text List ) and the file extension lines .
a simple list of separate context elements that will be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can simply convert your file doc@@ r@@ c to save your file / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / query / doc or global use . then create a folder ( such as you specified this file in your file like doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that this well and it &apos;s worth to be shared by using important information , e.g. what documentation is used to use &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ the community will not be rich , but we are proud to have worked with the best web@@ development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they are not alone . it is possible to divide the other Resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool bar with actions , scripts , templates ) to others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else . at different places there is an email entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email copy , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scrip@@ ted tree .
the resources can be uploaded in our head archive , where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can be checked , where our team would need to make a useful contribution to make an GP@@ G / P@@ GP key . so that the source of the resources will be ensured , both for our team as well as for the later users .
when you upload , you will need to be looking for their private GP@@ G key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase are not stored ) , or in the case you can check out the input fields ( URL preview can empty the input fields ) and with the click of OK .
the un@@ loading can be uploaded by menus D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) to upload tool bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts .
after downloading the resource , there is a resource requirement before installing the integrity and the Sig@@ ni@@ zation . in case of problems , the warning messages can be observed . if the integrity was given and the resource correct , the message appears to be correct , is a message with the message of the resource .
it is possible to work to XML @-@ languages , which is currently supported by creating a D@@ TE@@ P package , but it may be more complicated because hundreds of day files in the day XML format is necessary . there &apos;s a simple way to convert a D@@ TE@@ P package to a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started by the D@@ TD menu and conversion of a D@@ TD . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ TD description which should be used . afterwards , the following dialogue :

fine adjustment of D@@ TE@@ P according to the transformation : when activated , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; according to the conversion &amp; file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; Editor , it can be adapted to the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is some key concepts . in order to understand these concepts and full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , this chapter is to accommodate this concepts , without their understanding , without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work@@ area is divided into three areas : global , locally , and projection related to a range of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
global elements are available for each , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , which is selected as a globally marked , in the common party structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this enables the group of administrators to secure different tool bar , actions and patterns in the global tree to provide each in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements provide a personal collection of web development for individual users . these are custom @-@ specific patterns and tool bar . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be found all of all types of specific actions especially for the files of a specific project . all elements are stored in the folders of the project , which means that the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project em@@ ög@@ i .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several major areas : the editors window , the building views , the st@@ ables with info and the tool bar . please make sure and for more information about these areas .
you can click the box with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as the current , other or any security system , ext@@ ingu@@ ish , delete or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a reading mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the actual document .
a further context menu in the editorial area lead to a further context menu ( cut / copy / enter ) , editing the word under the mouse @-@ hand or opening the file , if the drawing chain under the mouse @-@ po@@ inter is a file named .
at the top end of the editors is the tool bar at the end of the editors . currently , &amp; HTML ; 4,@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool bar is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool bar will be adapted to the new functions and therefore associated user needs .
the use of tool bar is really easy . if you want to add a single day , then click the icon to enter the day . if you want to enter the data for this straight , you should add a day to fill the several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialogue with different fields .
the building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow for information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for example , to open them and stri@@ des . in the presentation with anti@@ ques are available for files , project , samples , document , attributes , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that is providing &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows you to remove the files stored in the project by means of right mouse click .
another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything you can use a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; There are all options open .
templates can be divided into three categories into which it depends on the category . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the corresponding user and templates in projects are only available in the project .
here you will find information about the available scripts . the concept of the integration in Global , Lok@@ al and Project works here . by clicking the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as script will start , edit or send us an email .
with this view , the internal structure of the active document has been set out . through links to a new element , the cur@@ sor is set on the position of the element . through right click of an element , a list of commands is open to navigation and collection of construction .
this tree appears among other construction views . with it , it can change man@@ ly attributes to the attributes . this tree allows to modify the contents in the contents , the change of all available attributes with a few mouse click .
here is the complete documentation of Web @-@ technology for your development . you can download it , you can create their own documentation , and by adding a letter to a project , a project can add project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two cart@@ on at the lower end of the window , on the useful information can be achieved : the news window and the problem windows .
this cart@@ on shows information about each in Qu@@ anta sub@@ script . such as the D@@ TD to the current document and all modifications are displayed in D@@ TD .
this cart@@ on shows all error in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are carried out , give all error messages ( such that are ) in this window .
s &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; factory @-@ bar are extensive and easy to understand . show it on a symbol and they receive the appropriate order . the chocolate set aside the tool is the possibility to define its own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
a further function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is the ability to send a tool bar by e @-@ mail . if you receive a tool bar at an email . if you get a tool bar at an email , they can be able to secure them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; just like any other secure and download !
it is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files to your system . in order to get to configure a complete list of options on the configure . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and here .
if you wish to check the problems of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check whether your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 file , you should make sure that does not have older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H . your folder is valid for &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . it has been optimised for rapid Web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful features .
while the effort , the best &amp; HTML Editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus started to deal with a close @-@ up idea : what would like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now , this would be an independent web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE ; so it &apos;s done so it was done .
not longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus should be summ@@ ed on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . it can be summ@@ ed in &amp; XML , so you should use &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; therefore the appropriate &amp; IDE should be .
now , it must be stated that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus should be described as a product on the outstanding efforts of entire &amp; K@@ DE ; it &apos;s not only possible to use it ? thanks to the &amp; K@@ DE ; rum@@ ors , it &apos;s not only possible to expand , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for you need to expand how they need it needs for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is possible to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this allows you to increase your task without any task . through the program , they can find &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you &apos;ll need to find any scripts without any scripts below . ( more information you find them in . )
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is a web@@ development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for a fast web development and quickly developed into a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in any way with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the details of any documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; currently developing and taken care by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon and LC @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
you can open a quick access list of files which you have opened . this list can open every time if you want to open a file , where the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for the later use . if you try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project pre @-@ run program , only an error was reported .
convert from the inter@@ connection there is a special sign for &amp; HTML ; switching , so they are correct , so that they are used correctly and not by the browser as a shape editor .
converts the text from the intermediate level in &amp; URL , which is the correct way to add from special sign and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is on the first line to add &amp; URL ; s in the anchor day .
the block selection indicates or from . that allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; button blocks .
goes directly to a Z@@ eil@@ en@@ code number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages are available !
this is looking for a drawing chain or regular expression in the selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined pre@@ press to help you .
showing the news window on or not to . that &apos;s the window , in which you can see the ad of scripts and the de@@ bug@@ ger .
evaluation and power of the problem @-@ por@@ ters at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the main battle is activated , once you change to structural tree .
displays the tool@@ box top left from the main window . this column allows you to set the read mark with one mouse click .
when it &apos;s read out in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with entries or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sors in the document .
read Book@@ mark from other open documents appear in the menu after fil@@ en@@ ames the other documents .
opens a pre @-@ developed project of the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects will be stored in the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for creating files into the current project . the selected files will be copied to the project directory .
you want to copy the project directory to new files that might be there . that allows for example graphic files in your project ord@@ ner or a sub@@ ord@@ ner and then add it to the project .
load the files in your project on the server . the list of the available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and whether you have further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages the project . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you can see the details .
invites a project tool bar . this project is kept in the project needs of a tool@@ bar , and only in this menu if they were assigned to this project .
a dialogue in order to save your tool bar . allows you to select the type of tool bar : locally or project .
opens a dialogue in order to add a new tool bar . this is created only the name . promotions will need to store the tool by means of the tool bar , or you wish to save the tool bar if you want to save the tool bar .
a tool bar from the sight range is a tool which is not saved by the hard disk . if you don &apos;t have the tool bar , you don &apos;t want to get if you want to do .
so that you can send their own tool bar at someone ( perhaps on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ team , so the tool bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item will open a new E@@ mail@@ message with the tool bar .
enables the upload from tool bar to the main server , where anyone can access it to any other . see in .
load a &amp; D@@ TD ; which you are or any other any other and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; its own smooth format .
re@@ charging from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it has been meaning@@ ful , if the du@@ cks of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if it is necessary to ren@@ ew the entire &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if that globally , and a write per@@ missions in the global K@@ DE file does not exist , failed to store the shop .
this menu contains a list of tags , which is loaded into the currently loaded tool bar , there is a sub @-@ menu item that contains a sub @-@ menu item that contains the list of tags / actions at this tool bar .
allows the access to the current day installation dialog , if there is an event . this entry is always available in the menu , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu .
activated or de@@ activate the intelligent set of tags . currently only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent connection means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus should be denied if this day is re@@ ject to the rules on this place .
plug@@ ins in the plug@@ ins menu are listed under the listed menu item . ank@@ li@@ zes them activated it . ank@@ li@@ zes of a activated plug@@ ins .
sel@@ ects the syn@@ tax @-@ mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on der@@ ate ; -@@ Version .
cho@@ oses the type of c@@ eil@@ ings license . very useful if you know people to use the other OS platforms for developers . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syn@@ tax of the current Docum@@ ents using the selected &amp; D@@ TD . by means of the external application .
immediate switching between the different types of the user interface . due to some limitations on the K@@ DE libraries , the switching card can be saved or un@@ nice graphics . it is recommended that the default mode is , or the flush @-@ mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
additionally , this menu includes an entry for each open Window System . with a selection of one single contract , the corresponding window will be activated .
the display of the status bar at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the changes in this dialogue is using any application that use the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browsers .
the behavior of the editors is one . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate , you will find details .
a dialogue appears in which you can delete the entries from the tool bar or what you can change the rows .
this should create a help in the environment of the mouse port , but is not implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is a high quality product that is freely available and free , but as with every open source project , developers can always be used to support it . if they want to support &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form you will find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled out at the top of the project , for example , according to the evaluation of the project , all these paths and author information can be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , the name will automatically be filled out file .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in small book and no spaces with the extension of web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. fo@@ o.@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine , which you want to access local data . either one name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemplary .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
one can empty this field empty , the standard settings of the chosen protocol uses . depending on the setup of the remote setup may be necessary .
that is the folder where the template must be stored for the Project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a joint collection of files created for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
that is the folder where the tool is stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and standard tool@@ bars . if a joint collection of files used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to add files from the local file system into the project . it can be selected several files or entire folders .
this setting is great , if you want to download static Web@@ in@@ let , you want to download and modify . in case of ser@@ ei@@ ve scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you must go different .
if files that are stored anywhere in the main ord@@ ner of the project , if a project is started on new , not an@@ aken if the project is not started .
using this option all files and folders are displayed in the main course and can be seen from a detailed selection of reviews .
this is a list of files in the main ord@@ ner . you can select the files by an@@ ho@@ oks , or by removing nail , bra@@ ckets in the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant includes three settings to load your work . this settings can be uploaded in the menu item for the menu of the menu or by the keyboard Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to the project assistant and are described in the project . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( square holder possible ) , which can be ignored by project operations such as project ord@@ ner .
complem@@ entary option to the above , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded by the opening of the project . it can be read more about project prospects .
this enables the desired de@@ bug@@ ger . currently only Gub@@ ed is being supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be set in . the de@@ bu@@ cket @-@ plug@@ in can be set with the button options .
in the lower window profiles , high loading profiles ( see in ) can be adjusted , as well as the display of an arrangement for the content of the server for each profile by po@@ ge to an own structure for each profile .
in the window team configuration , project members can be processed , processed or deleted as well as a mail@@ ing list . see the details .
in the lower event configuration , you can modify the event actions , change or delete them . event actions will be carried out if a previously particular event will act as such as the f@@ ears of a file . see in the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus will open the last project , which was opened . this behaviour you can not influence this behaviour .
to open a project , select the Project .... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool bar . the dialog box is displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is closed , the project file will be automatically stored . you will be asked if you want to save changes when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this is done when you load a new project .
the project development is free access to the files in the project . you can manage files on the current project in the current project .
folder behavior as well , however , the entries open and opening with ... in the right mouse button @-@ call Con@@ text menu :
here , various profiles can be sought here . the profile contains information about the place of the uploaded files . see .
allows to remove the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button is left to prevent the removing .
password is not forgotten in the core memory and for programming . this option is useful if frequency up@@ load of files is needed and the rather un@@ secure password on the plate is not required in question .
that will stop the transmission or simply left the dialog , when you change your opinion from the high load .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high loading profiles can be uploaded and therefore the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different server . when editing or creating a profile is displayed on this dialog box :
this is the name of the server that will be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address .
a transfer protocol for the high load . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and the installed K@@ IO slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP , a file ( locally ) and NFS .
port for transfers . normally , this must not be changed , except the network administrator operates a service not to the usual port .
depending on your account , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a risk . if the password is stored on the plate , so it is not easy to read , but each with program@@ mer can see it easily in the plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool bar . it can be loaded into a project of many views , which means other files and tool bar , replace various files and tool bar , replace the files and tool bar .
views can be reached in the menu or the project tool bar , which are stored on the tool bar project , be opened or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has to do most of them . this helps increase productivity , but also allows the adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; its own work is also possible .
as mentioned above is the tool bar at &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the best @-@ down menu tool bar can be stack@@ ed . use and adding them . adding tool bar is treated at the section of the tool bar at the bottom section .
the tool bar and symbols can be set either by means of the context menu ( right to the tool bar ) , which can be set to adjust other actions such as tool@@ bar , which can be set to the dialog box , which can be displayed in the dialog box to be visible on this or other tool bar .
by call of the context menus for a promotion ( symbol ) on a tool bar , in addition the entries are removed and the action are displayed , self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool bar and the actions of them can set up on them in the menu with the same tool bar ... and settings actions be set .
templates are templates for a common file , code @-@ Schn@@ itz@@ el and files as a common file system . you can move like a common file system with an extended organisation and interfaces . it is templates in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about those restrictions you have to fil@@ esystem the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the supplied template for their use . please read the conditions before the use of each template conditions in front of the use .
bin@@ d is everything , what does not exist . there &apos;s any file except text , e.g. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash @-@ files and etc . ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) are inserted . some examples are found in the pres@@ tige of a global template . further information for templates tree is available in .
documents can be created from any text documents . based on this template documents , new documents can be prepared for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in the corresponding way to be efficiently . some examples can be found in the pre @-@ run tree . see for more information to templates tree .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should be add up to a full menu of up to a complete menu system on Jav@@ as@@ cri@@ pt or Perl . some examples are given in the pres@@ tige of a global template . see for more information to templates tree .
as the name says , these templates for all sites are templates . they are a collection of different documents that can be arranged in a folder structure and can be summ@@ arized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
design a document structure according to exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select the file when you save the local template ....
as soon as the happened is , you notice that ( even if it has been stored as a project task ) the model was not visible in the project tree . look at the pres@@ tige of the project .
select text in your document and click on file as a template selection as local / project file . alternatively , the option can easily be moved with Zi@@ pping and disman@@ tling to the structure of the building .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file is just enough to copy the file management functions , so that all file management functions can be used , such as bricks and insert or add over the file tree from Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can select any file or in the project files or in the project files , click on a folder on the right and site template . by default , the project is secured , but of course , it can be stored as a local or global template .
project pre @-@ up and a very targeted pre @-@ oriented approach . you can make head@@ lines and foot @-@ lines , or dynami@@ cally set with PHP ; design , files into or with them . additionally , some things can keep some things during the use of templates in projects very deep in mind .
the im@@ plant structure based on the lower window is based on the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / common and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / accommodation unit . each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of containers , as described above .
to set the behaviour of a party , in order to click the folder with the right mouse button on the folder and to select the context menu tab . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is low as soon as Als@@ ati@@ an At@@ tor@@ so is intact .
this is activated as standard , if a tri@@ ord@@ ner would be noticed , except they would be explicitly enabled in this path . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text @-@ Bau@@ stein . if nothing appears to be there , one is likely to be found in a tri@@ ord@@ ner .
you can also be ordered or modified text for templates in this folder . this could be the head@@ lines or foot lines for all template templates in a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ lines , and try out a whole presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / foot lines .
in addition , the context menu ( this show , right mouse button ) can be used on a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and add @-@ mail templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus features two modes : VP@@ L ; Editor and VP@@ L ; &amp; Source Editor , which can be reached via the VP@@ L Editor and the Second shares the editors box in two parts : the source text Editor and the VP@@ L Editor @-@ editor .
the VP@@ L ; Editor works as follows : it charges a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; then you can edit and when needed for source code Editor , in which the safety changes in VP@@ L @-@ Editor can be seen in the source code .
when working with the VP@@ L ; Editor , it is possible to edit a small symbol of the V@@ oh@@ and@@ ler from PHP ; source code . to edit &amp; PHP ; it is still necessary to process the source code Editor . there &apos;s no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode is just like the first , except that the changes are activated in the source code editors and the VP@@ L Editor @-@ editor . with pressures of F@@ 9 , this mode is activated , this mode is activated , the button to keep the active cur@@ sor from a window onto it which will retain the position in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the VP@@ L ; Editor and the source code editors can be set between synchron@@ isation in one click or automatically . in the selection , the recommendation can be set automatically . basically , the recommendation can be adjusted for fast and a large donation for slow machine .
it is supposed to change the title of the website , so it is possible to choose any document with the VP@@ L Editor -@@ editor . this document will be created as soon as a new document with the VP@@ L ; Editor is created . this makes it possible to change the toler@@ ant .
met@@ a @-@ tags for storing information about the document self @-@ search for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below . click on the list the content of content , such as key@@ words on the column name and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the content .
CSS rules are the new way of design for the use of pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change on the list is exactly as with the met@@ a @-@ elements . editing and CSS rules are currently supported .
it is possible to connect to an external CSS style file , enabling you to connect to the file button and select the appropriate file .
the use of the cur@@ sors is like in a text processing , due to the parts . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor is still used . the text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by inser@@ ting and reset button or remove the back button .
the insert of tags is made in the same way beyond the tool bar , such as the source code editors . if an anchor day is not removed , e.g. an anchor day , surround with the text , any other convertible anchor drops must be removed .
some tool used as the tables assistant or the lists of the lists . you will later work in &amp; VP@@ L ; it will work in this release the tables or lists of the tool used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation period of style . in contrast to other programs , the search for certain elements are possible and the execution of the style can be pursued .
to comp@@ ile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; it also need to comp@@ ile it , except &amp; K@@ DE , the libraries of lib@@ x@@ sl@@ t , li@@ be@@ x@@ sl@@ t and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; K@@ DE .

there are many graphical tools for the same . why therefore &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain , why I have written .
the mer@@ ging was very complicated because one of the contribution was made possible because , at the same time , a further programm@@ ers had changed a lot in the same file . the result was many conflicts in the mer@@ ging .
the program showed me only the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what exactly what happened within these lines . and there were no indications on putting the places where the mer@@ ging of these changes was a small album space .
so , this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 was able to show differences within a line and changes in white signs . later , any number of other useful functions were added later .
if you want to compare my text , copy it simply to the intermediate level and add it in one of the comparative window .
a function that made a lot of work , was the same and merge perform folders . this function related &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way @-@ merge works completely , if two people do not work independently of one piece co @-@ work and changes in the automatic case . in this editor you can even edit the results even directly . in this editor , the screen photo shows three Qu@@ ell files at the merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you with the same and merge , complete folders . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and user @-@ driven ways with the possibilities of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you have to check out this function you like .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs , one can see a look at the column in the column on the left side . ( no trouble with more if J@@ NO changes . )
if a file is equal to , and the other is different in a line , then the colour is different . red color means that both can distinguish themselves .
if all files have the same names , but in various folders , you can facilitate the Ti@@ p@@ par@@ agus by choosing only the fil@@ en@@ ames in the first file . example :
folders 1 , folder 2 , diff@@ use , diff@@ 3 folders 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 , tier 3 folders 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 folders
the opening dialog box allows you to open a choice of file browser ( file ... ) or select a most recently opened file . it doesn &apos;t need to specify a third file . if you need to check the entry for C , the analysis of the differences is carried out with two files .
when you select a folder where you can select a folder , if you select a folder , if you select a folder , for B and C , I used a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; fil@@ en@@ ames from A in the two other folders .
if mer@@ ase is set up , the input field will be active for the purpose . however , it is not necessarily necessary to specify a output file . you can do this step even later on the memory .
the set @-@ up will open a dialog with Settings . you can set the options before you start using the same / merge .
sometimes , you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . it allows you to select text boxes in the active comparative window . compared to the opening dialog , you do not select any files you can easily connect to the dialog with the knob .
you can also use Zi@@ ent and retri@@ eval : pull out a file from a file manager or selected text from one editor , and let it drop him via a settlement window .
that thought behind it ? sometimes contains a file like many similar functions . you would need to create a relatively large effort . they would have to add two corresponding files , they would be in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then compare the relevant sections simply to copy and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can pull anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only pull the case of text in a reference window is supported .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the Zi@@ pping and retri@@ eve of text into another program as a cut and add ( instead of copying and single ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text box is the info number A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the number of the first visible line . ( when the path comes to a file ) , you will rest a while on the line . then a little relief window will be displayed on the line . )
the three sources are the letters A , B and C . A has the color blue , B the colour green and C is mag@@ enta . ( this default can be changed over the settings menu ) .
if a difference is detected , one can see the color in the color , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is good in the next section ( merge updates ) .
right next to the text , the column is displayed . when differences in white signs , the colour is not so important to see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , relevant for Pre@@ processor and in few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line , which separates the summary of the text , is interrupted by the positions where the respective source file does not have any lines . if the tw@@ inning is activated , the line is represented on broken lines .
the results window ( under the settlement ) has also has an info @-@ on line with the inscription : the fil@@ en@@ ames and &#91; changes &#93; if you have the result . usually , it contains text , but often also contains conflicts .
! ! ! to all conflicts , the storage needs to be disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons ) in the most un@@ solved / ung@@ ed conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison can be used , each difference is also solved a conflict in the case that can be changed manually at the same time .
by clicking one of the left mouse button in one of the window will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this will then be the current group . ) This is then the current group . it will be produced with color background color for current area and each on the left appears as a black beams .
sometimes , no further line will be left in the group ; then this is a place for the case that you change your mind and perhaps again a different source . this text does not appear again in the final file , nor in a sign that you might perhaps copy and differently .
the text &amp; lt ; mer@@ ges con@@ tours ; however , if you copy this text if you copy a text from the results window . do not go through this function .
note : if the sources choose the options , ignore or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are treated as white characters .
to use the mouse buttons , you can use the keyboard buttons to the right , then you can use the keyboard buttons on the right side , at the beginning , the end , tr@@ l @-@ at and shrub at the end , which can also be used by other programs . the vertical column next to the vertical frame bar can also be used .
in the Aug@@ abe@@ e window , you can also use the other keys to editing . with the single button , you can switch between in@@ feed and back@@ pack mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode ) .
one click with the left mouse button in one of the mer@@ ging columns we synchron@@ ize the view of all windows on the beginning of the respective group ( as described in the section and the ed@@ itable output window ) .
the tool bar also contains seven buttons on navigation with which you can jump to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g / C@@ tr@@ l / C@@ tr@@ l ) or next to the next / previous conflict . therefore , you do not continue to dissolve itself as a conflict . therefore , the conflict must be distinguished between the most important and un@@ solved conflicts .
to copy the marking within the intermediate position , you need to copy the copying button ( Str@@ g @-@ C or Str@@ g ) option . if this is activated , the copy will be automatically copied , and you will be careful with this option but you could not write the contents of the intermediate position .
Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ers are stored according to the underlying operating system . UNIX variants are using a Z@@ eil@@ en@@ code \ \ r \ &apos; . K@@ diff@@ 3 reserves the tick @-@ up of the source files , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use binary files .
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically and restored with the next start . ( Menu adjusting element - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
select a writing with fixed width . ( on a few systems the dialog with variable width is available for selection , you should not use this writing . )
if you want to activate this option , differences in cur@@ ly writing . if the chosen writing is not supported , this representation happened .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be ger@@ ast@@ ert . on this systems the button is automatically set an odd color .
if this option is activated , the pressing the Tab@@ ulator button is inserted for the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise a Tab@@ ulator is inserted .
when using input or return , the retri@@ eval of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is activated , every choice will be copied automatically into the intermediate level . the manual copy is cut into the intermediate level .
you can select what Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ende type you prefer to save . the default value is the general selection of the used operating system used .
first step is trying to find &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white signs are ignored . the second step is not ignored . in this step white signs will not be ignored . also , white signs are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) you want to look back with different sizes in \ \ &apos; at the end of a row , but you could only save files with different sizes on the side effects . however , if this option is enabled , however , the option must be disabled . during the merge , this option must be disabled .
in the default setting this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; &apos; &apos; ) igno@@ res . in the result , the differences are still indicated , but they are treated as white signs .
in the default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white signs .
intensively after a smaller differences , the option is enabled in the default . it is effective at complicated and large files , but slowly at very large files .
as long @-@ to @-@ jump mode , this setting is indicated as long as the result of the selection , before the next un@@ even conflict will continue straight ahead .
it is useful if the selected file is used as a source . ( default is manual option ) . if you want to use white characters in many files . please note that the Automatic option may also be used in numbers or comments if the options are ignored , or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + Comments .
this options will be treated in Chapter to a scanning of folders and lead to a merge . look for details under documentation on the directory @-@ comparing and con@@ sign@@ ment .
if a file is stored and already a older version , the original version will be accessed using the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original file , if there is already a back@@ up@@ file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original file , this file is removed without further backup .
this option is not the language of the user interface . it does not need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; finish and re@@ launch , making the change . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language there is globally beyond the control centre . )
the following coding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , it will be used for all entries in the upper setting .
via the select fields for the coding appears to be a short notice that the local coding is . ( this may not be changed and has for you purely inform@@ al character . )
fit the file encoding for source files . this is affected , how special characters are treated and interpre@@ tations . since the encoding for each file can be adjusted individually , even files can be compared with different coding .
if you have a file , you can set here you specify what coding is to be used .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands it might be possible to work with your codec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only be encoded with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) to this option you can define the coding of the pre @-@ processing procedure .
switch it from the high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in the text or overview periods . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + Comments &quot; )
this option is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , you can see only the differences between two of the three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; B , A &amp; B ; -@@ b ; C or B &amp; lt ; C is indicated in addition to the normal one second over@@ sized column with the required information .
sometimes one wants to use the available space on the screen for long lines . da@@ zzle you simply use the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
ord@@ net the comparison window side by side or over@@ one another . this can also be useful to display of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes , you can compare the differences and decide to start the files . a simple click starts using the file name and uses the file name for output file . ( if this function is used to start the merge , then the name of the most recently used output file will be retained . )
in case of a file , it becomes visible in this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , the output of the command is visible , and not the file yourself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that is precisely to your needs . for example , this function can be used for out interference @-@ out parts or re@@ trac@@ ting any file .
when reading a file , it is specified in this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified , the issue of this command is only used for the case . you can write your own pre@@ processor that corresponds to your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the thought of it is , the user needs more flexibility when changing the di@@ ff results . however , an external program needs to program , and most users want to program even program . the Good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely .
use this pre@@ processing line for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ oid in order to convert the input in large letters : the \ \ &apos; s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s this process is found on the found text in the first Kl@@ am@@ mer@@ a few . \ \ U turns the first text in large letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems are required to use the following pattern : the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you knew experim@@ enting , maybe you begin to understand it and maybe you like this regular expres@@ sions . you are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the Ig@@ nor@@ ms of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . however it is good as an example of a further pre @-@ processing order for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ sten@@ ed . &quot; s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; each of the character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a Tre@@ ffer , and every Tre@@ ffer will be replaced by nothing , thus un@@ mistak@@ enly deleted .
sometimes , you would like to perform several successes on once . then you can use the Semi@@ kol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the texts of each other . example :
instead , you can also use some different ways like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / Er@@ l / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; aller@@ gens are needed in per@@ l some details . where the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s requires per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data on the normal pre@@ processor are retain for the display and to perform , the other operations can only change the data that the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ normal @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m can be seen .
please note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ code pre@@ processor looks the issue of the normal price processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with each function , the text changed or differences , you may not notice certain differences , and in the worst case important data .
often , program@@ mer must be edit in a folder of many files . therefore , you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders and merge together .
... makes a proposal to merge a proposal ; you can adapt the proposal before the start
... can simul@@ ate simul@@ ate simul@@ ated changes and simul@@ ated the simul@@ ated changes , without having to perform ,
... select selected campaigns either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is the same and merge of individual files very similar . you have to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders will be merged , then Ord@@ ner@@ 1 is used as the basis . if no target sub@@ missions was used , uses &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; Ord@@ ner@@ ed 3 as a target .
note that only the comparison of folders will automatically be able to start the merge . to start the merge , you have to select the corresponding menu entry or the F@@ 7 key press . ( more details follow . )
during the reading of the folder you can break a little news on the current progress . if you break the scanning of the folder , only the files listed , which were compared to then .
when the scanning of the folder is finished , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left @-@ hand side , ...
each file and each folder of the scan has been found here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click here .
the folder structure is usually represented . you can click on the + / - click on the object , or by clicking the arrow keys for your left / right . the directory menu includes two functions . all options can be folded and can be folded in which you can open all folders .
when you click on a file , click the file comparison and it appears on a settlement .
the symbol of the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . this types are possible :
if the type of file type in the other folders is visible , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane . in such a case , the group@@ ing action can &apos;t be chosen automatically . if the merge is started , you will further be informed about any problems of this kind .
as in the above picture , you will see in columns A / B / C the colours red , green , yellow and black .
in identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folder are identical as identical as their whole content is identical . then , the same color does not have the same color . for folders , the age is un@@ significant for its color .
the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ le . colours are the colours of a leaf@@ let again , which is only green , then yellow it becomes and later when it is old , red .
... A and C is identical but not to B : copy of B ( or if B doesn &apos;t exists , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C is identical but not a : copy of A ( or if A doesn &apos;t exists , delete the target ) if it exists )
... A , B and C does not have the same dat@@ at@@ ype ( e.g. if a folder and B one file ) : fault : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ts objects can exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same dat@@ at@@ ype ( e.g. if a folder and B one file ) : fault : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ts objects can exist , the merge cannot be started .
the mode to synchron@@ isation is active , if only two folders and no more explicitly point target , then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action taken from the file that both folders are identical . if necessary for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : together , and the result in both folders . ( the user can see as a visible file name for output file only B ; directly after the merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B after A. )
if two folders are activated , then the date of files are activated ( un@@ certain ) , but the same date will error error : files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such error are not allowed , the merge perform the folder can &apos;t be started .
while the merge will perform a file after another . you perform status column , if the merge has been successfully completed , and according to other tun@@ es , if the merge has been completed , you should see a last review and see whether the status is everywhere in order .
if in the setup dialog will be chosen for the file @-@ comparative Analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will contain further columns . these contain the number of invali@@ ds , not white and white conflicts . ( the column of the conflicts is displayed only if three folders are compared or assembled together . )
you can either select the only selected entry ( file or O@@ dner ) , or all entries once again . if you have chosen all inter@@ connected actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note that if you have no target set , then in the Three @-@ folder mode C , you will be used as a target as a target of the two @-@ folder merge , B and / or B will be used as a target .
if you have chosen a target date , please check if all entries should be displayed in the target structure . there are some options by using certain entries could be shot . check the options by un@@ willing sur@@ prises :
to support all entries in the directory : select the directory running / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key@@ word ) . in order to perform only the current entry : select the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if due to conflic@@ ting dat@@ at@@ ypes still exist , a message appears on the incorrect elements . you can select a valid action for them .
once you perform all the entries , a dialogue is appears with the options running , Sim@@ u@@ ulate and break .
choose Sim@@ u@@ ulate if you would like to see what would happen without the really changes . you will then get an exhaus@@ tive list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then specific actions with all entries are required . if a manual procedure is necessary ( together with a single file ) , then a merge windows ( please note the screen photo ) .
if you are ready to start your file , select a directory running / continue , or press F@@ 7 . if you are not stored , a corresponding dialogue appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue his work with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you will see a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will need some error messages to ski@@ p you the problem of the problem . so you have the possibility to select a different action for entry or any other way before you continue with the merge .
if some entries are individually combined , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries are not stored together . even if you have shown that the entries have been done , or not stored , these entries are carried out . only if you change the merge action , these entries are again assembled together .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Def@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory connection with these options :
only files that can be displayed in the element tree . separate samples are entered . separate space holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e. g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . default is * . folders must not correspond to this pattern .
files and folders correspond to this pattern , not in the element tree . it can be entered as a sample , use the Semi@@ kol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid space holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original . * .@@ O .
files and folders correspond to this pattern , not in the element tree . it can be entered as a sample , use the Semi@@ kol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid space holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original . * .@@ O .
igno@@ res files that would be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ matic is ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this order is specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( check out at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files are hidden and hidden in other fil@@ esystem . this option can decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on the default .
when links to files : if the option is switched , symbolic link is compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to the links below . this is enabled by default .
links to the folder : if the option is switched on , if the option is switched on a file . if the option is switched on a link to a computer , it would lead to a final loop ( &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the option is switched off . ) This option is switched off .
complete analysis of each file has a complete analysis of each file and shows the statistical analysis . the full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when they are used on files that do not contain any text . ( give an appropriate type of anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare big folder via a slow network , it is possible to compare the file date , and the file size to compare the file size . this speed advantage is not a certain level of safety . please use caution . this option is in the default setting .
similarly , the files shall be considered as identical . the files will be considered as identical if they are equal . for example , if you want to recover , if you use the copy of the date , please use caution . this option is in the default setting .
activated the synchron@@ isation mode when two folders were compared and no target command . in this mode the proposals will be identical to that both folders are identical . even the results from the files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in the default .
if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is suggested as action . ( this will not be aware that the other file doesn &apos;t have changed . you should check this in any case . ) This option is switched off .
if a file is replaced or deleted by a file or deleted , the original version will be renamed . if a old backup file is already deleted , this is the default function of single files , not only the mer@@ ging of individual folders . this option is switched on the default .
normally the folder @-@ merge updates will be visible . if you don &apos;t want to move the window with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to move the windows directory on the window , the Window window will switch off the window between directory &amp; text window between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file with double clicking on the menu . nevertheless , you can save the function of your single file . once you want to save the status , the status is set out , and the file doesn &apos;t run again if you run the folders .
this status is lost , if you read the directory once again : directory menu : new read
K@@ DE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 used to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open the files that are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syn@@ tax as local files and folders . a few things you should note :
a path may be relatively short . or .. . this is not possible with UR@@ Ls not possible , these are always absolutely .
special characters must be m@@ apped . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces , &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes , because of the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the used protocol . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it may not be distinguished whether a link to a file or a folder shows . then a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) .
there is no possibility to process permission or change date . therefore , the permission or change date of original file . ( please note the option of the size of the size . ) ( this is only possible with local files ) .
the main purpose is currently known as a difference of differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op is first to start the differences of the difference . to shoot K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences and then select in K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part out of the context menu .
normally you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files ; if it takes place , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the Patch @-@ file . at least one of the two files must be exist . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to be missing in the missing file .
in Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can select a Patch @-@ file , and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists . in addition , this is un@@ reliable , if the original files have been changed since the creation of the Patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is carried out , it only supports the same amount of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the mer@@ ging or the same of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name of K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now he@@ et is comp@@ li@@ are ) . in addition , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 has already shown that it may lead , such as the diff@@ 3 program from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I use the GP@@ L programs already very long and I have learned plenty of other programs in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone this way or go it .
you have not compiled a program from sources and configure the correct PRE@@ F@@ IX to K@@ DE but then can &apos;t find K@@ DE for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) , and can &apos;t find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters are differently ; however , these lines will be different as identical ; however , the line is not identical as a non @-@ white signs , the line is not identical to the number of signs at the next to each other , this ad@@ is co@@ operatives . this is the case .
the editor is in any difference in the files where he begins and turn . this important information is needed , if the result is simply saved as text file , and it is easy to create , extra to create an own file format that could save this information .
the effort was so far too large . you can always use a certain version always through the outlet of a source A / B / C . in order to handle larger quantities of text , one other editor should be used .
after remove the text is suddenly ; No sr@@ c left ; published and the text is not ext@@ ingu@@ ished . what does this means and how can be removed .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colours as an differences between differences and differences . even more high@@ lighting would be confused and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this purpose .
many good ideas and troub@@ lesho@@ oting came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you will need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 or later .
you can use K@@ Def@@ 3 to other platforms without K@@ DE , you can find at the homepage .
a list of last changes are found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Ch@@ angel@@ og file in the Qu@@ ell package .
to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; installed on a system with &amp; K@@ DE ; use the following command in the base ord@@ ner of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ You gives the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are sure to find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake should not have any problems when compres@@ sing . should still occur , report on the &amp; K@@ DE ; mail@@ ing lists of them .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Um@@ sch@@ alt ) copied into the intermediate situation and results of the selected text . add ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift ) add the text from the intermediate position on the current cur@@ sor position , or replaces the current marking .
only differences : files listed in all folders are not appear in the order structure , and therefore not in the target sector .
in the current version version you have to read the folder with the function updating to this options . )
only entries are displayed , the differences have not show that identical files are not already copied in the target . if the target command will not be missing , they are missing according to the merge . ( the behavior will likely change in a later program version ) this option is switched off .
check the buttons for selecting the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar , check the lines from the corresponding window at the end of the selected group@@ set ( if they are already present ) , if the lines are already present , they are again removed on the button .
in the default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white signs .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager is quite convenient to watch all virtual desktop space . it is quite convenient to modify the current programs to the work area , their size to change it or to move them . this works both within a working area and several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager is able to display all virtual desktop space as well as in this applications . applications can be selected and even within the work surface and to other moves .
with the mean mouse button , windows within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be moved ; the movement is possible both within a working area and other working areas .
the context menu depends on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . however , the context menu has only the two entries within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; there is also the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries due to the entries , i.e. the work area and be@@ ating . commands the following commands :
maxi@@ mi@@ zes the application window onto the full size of the working area . appears only if on an application .
sends the application for the selected virtual desktop space . only if an application was cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the work surface and to be moved to other working areas .
when this field is crossed , are displayed in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual desktop area .
check the field this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual desktop space . it &apos;s made along with name , the names will be provided with atomic numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st floor space .
when this field is crossed , the background is displayed in the background area as a background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is crossed , the ongoing programmes are displayed as small window in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in otherwise you will appear only the empty work area to enable your selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . the window with its standard symbol symbol window . symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and pixel map shows a small view of the real programme . re@@ mark : pixel map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be determined here : classic &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be known as from P@@ ager applications ; horizontal driving displays all virtual desktop space in a horizontal and vertical series , which is very well suited for the display at the area of the working area .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager miniature program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , the windows or with their content , it is also running outside the control bar .
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent installation of switch @-@ on ... lets you appear to set the dialog box .
currently this may not be changed in the dialog settings , but you can do manually do this :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ p@@ ag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . Falls for the file , you need to register your system administrators . in this file , you have to set the key win@@ dow@@ ns transparent and set it a value . possible values :
da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , part of the package , you will need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic packages .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen @-@ pump . you can read it with &amp; k@@ mag ; this application can be interesting for various users . this application includes artists , web designers and people with a vision of vision . this documentation is to be a fully automated manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag ;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly enhanced with new functions . it is optimised for use on high @-@ performance trans@@ formers .
if you start &amp; k@@ mag ; see the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; the main window is displayed on the screen . in the following this window is displayed as the magni@@ fication window . the image is displayed in the magni@@ fication window , is a enlarged area of the screen and is described in the following a selection box .
the standard setting increases &amp; k@@ mag ; alternatively , you can use &amp; k@@ mag ; alternatively , you can use a selected screen area at the magni@@ fication window ( a select fen@@ ster@@ mode ) or the surrounding of the mouse vessel at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left screen ) .
would you avoid that the mouse po@@ inter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse po@@ etic . at present , it is not able to recognize the shape of the mouse port . this is always the standard K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse @-@ mouse .
in the selection mode , you can change the selection box to your own needs . you can change it with the arrow and mouse buttons and its size . this can be made in the following way :
move the mouse po@@ inter in the magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button , so you can move the contents of the magni@@ fication table and move . this goes also with the arrow keys .
if you need to press the &amp; Shift ; button press or the M@@ MB ; you can move the selection box .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection box . note that the upper left corner of the selection of a select stand is remains only the lower right corner .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the expanded picture directly to the printer , in a file , to copy it into the intermediate position ( to insert it later into other applications ) , the image and much more .
or stop the update of the display . the stop of the updating is ensured that the required CPU @-@ time is against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , low , average , H@@ och , Very high ) . higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode a selection box is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically identi@@ fies your sorted short commands to store files , opening a new window , printing , ne@@ ul@@ ades ( with the button document again in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and c@@ lei@@ c &amp; etc ; .
k@@ gs also known as &amp; k@@ rit@@ fier ; for example , you can use a lu@@ ke@@ yp@@ ad in a newspaper or a photo to view it . this application is for various people of benefit : from en@@ che@@ ur or artists up to the web designer or visual handicapped .

&amp; B &apos;s quali@@ fier ; was developed by Olaf Schmidt o@@ j@@ schmi@@ dt @ k@@ de@@ .org and Sar@@ ang Lak@@ are s@@ f@@ .net and Michael For@@ ster For@@ ster @ f@@ mi@@ .@@ uni @-@ pass@@ au@@ .de .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool as soon as the mouse @-@ mouse becomes a while on the same place . it is intended to help people who suffer from the R@@ SI syndrome ( rep@@ eti@@ tive @-@ in @-@ incre@@ ment syndrome ) and of which each mouse click pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool as soon as the mouse @-@ mouse is thought to help people who suffer from the re@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ ps in In@@ k ( R@@ SI ) , and of which every mouse click pain . moreover , it is also a little exercise with the mouse . however , this requires a little exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool as can use the pain in the mouse , and helps you to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can mount a doctor with the use of your computer , if you are looking for a doctor if this is not done .
to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain , it helps with pain in the mouse , it can be used against pain , which caused by the mouse due to the mouse . the result can be used for each range of the mouse .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitor your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you break the movement .
this is the intelligent shift , it is activated by the end of the movement , before the su@@ mption of the mouse button is executed . on this way , you can execute the mouse button of the mouse button . this way , the intelligent turn , requires a little exercise , but you get rid of it quickly .
this worsen@@ ing time must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; one mouse click here .
it is a powerful displacement , the shooting field is switched ( 1 / 10 s ) , when the mouse button is waiting for the mouse button , before the mouse button is ready , if there is not a fun@@ nel due to the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool as well , this function is activated by a slow mouse . this movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool as well ; the first time , it can be changed later .
when the sound delayed , you can move the &amp; K@@ DE , let &apos;s move to sound &amp; multimedia , select the sound system and here the rider General . there is a sliding sound buffer , which you can set to a lower value to reduce the response times .
this setting is marked by &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; for every start of &amp; K@@ DE ; this function is currently available only under &amp; K@@ DE ; in case of G@@ NO@@ ME or other window , please send the respective documentation to figure out what you will automatically start there .
if all settings are back on the values , which were set when opening the dialogue . have already the button of the button , you will have set the settings on the stand after the last pressures of application .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool as well ; initially with the default . in particular the intelligent move , you should first read the automatic mouse click , then you can turn to the intelligent move .
if you use the read@@ able click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; K@@ DE ; if you want to reduce the response times of &amp; K@@ DE ;
first , you should make sure to make a mouse click without effect : the click on the neutral components of windows or to places in the browser window which does not contain any link . you can use the mouse to such places , until you wish to use them back .
if your mouse printer should be able to clean your mouse . this is normally pretty easy . the tri@@ ck is that you will not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles , which come with the mouse ball in contact with the mouse .
first , you need to take the mouse of the mouse . as this happens , is from mouse to mouse differently . it should be clear if you see the base of mouse .
if you have the ball , you would have to see the ball . these are located on the sides of the Loch@@ es , in which the ball was used . the Dre@@ ck and the contamination can easily be easily accessible with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ing .
in very rare situations , the operating system used by &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if in this case , if you use the intelligent shift , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool as well ; the surgery can not finish more through the lot of the mouse button .
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; under another window manager and a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click . this is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool as well , and you can still work as usual .
problem : if you enter the text , tried &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool as well as mouse click , and the cur@@ sor is mounted on a different place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to place where you want to use the mouse on a neutral area of the mouse . the safe zones for the mouse po@@ etic are &amp; eg ; the grey surfaces to the tool bar and menus and the front head@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent turn , but I made it not to edit text .
the intelligent shift is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool as well as it needs to move into this way . if you want to move the mouse on the mouse button , but if you want to move the mouse for pressed mouse button . but there is likely to prepare for any problems here :
do not use the intelligent shift , if you have just got to start my k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool as follows : click the mouse at the end of the text area and hold the conversion key , while you move the mouse @-@ hand to the other end of the text , and once again the mouse but@@ ton@@ ing .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . as a result , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool as a click @-@ off . so , you know , when the intelligent move begins . later , you can use the intelligent move , even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise .

probably you have the command to the language edition not correctly or completely entered . open the mouth , you will open the page General Settings and enter the command for the voice guidance on the map material . ( see list dialog for language syn@@ thesizer . )
Festival is a language edition of the Edinburgh University . currently , only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch are currently supported . the license allows you to use the festival free to use and spread without any restrictions .
in order to show an example of the command line for the voice guidance , it is believed that the festival in the / usr / local / festival is installed . the command to speech is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java file generator . currently , it does only support the English language . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free to use and spread without any restrictions .
in order to show an example of the command line for the establishment of voice guidance , it is supposed to be installed that Free@@ T@@ TS in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ igh@@ ter is installed . the language edition is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option has to send data as standard settings . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of ph@@ onic belts into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , therefore you need an additional program to use the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA for adoption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax will glad@@ ly express the final sign of the text , so that an additional character must be added . the full command is therefore more expensive than in other examples :
( CAT - echo ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / usr / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in a row . option data is enabled as standard settings .
the language edition of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; K@@ DE ; more language service , provided by all &amp; K@@ DE and is a standard interface for language output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it is used to support various language output systems .
as the option of speech is used only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you have to use only option as language service in &amp; mouth mouth .
for setting , use K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service , which is available in the production dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; mouth mouth ; successful you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; mouth mouth needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for voice generator ) , which depends on your computer and configuration .
&amp; mouth mouth ; is an application with the people who cannot be able to spend the text by the calcul@@ ator . there will be a list already known sets , which allows users to leave the user again .

before you are using &amp; kt@@ ts ; you will need to install a program for installation settings and set correctly . see also
for the first start of kt@@ ro@@ gr or as long as no speaker , the card speaker is displayed . see also if you have a speaker , the box map is displayed . see .
most of the T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer offer different languages , or such that way , as spokes@@ person for a syn@@ thesizer . you may also see several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least one speaker , before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use the program speed @-@ free , otherwise the standard speaker is used .
various speaker for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to the same printer for the same printer .
if you click on the box card spokes@@ person in kt@@ sm@@ gr , the box map will then be displayed . this will be automatically set if you start plug and not a speaker .
all of the speakers will appear in this list . the preferred speaker appear on the list . the top speaker is used for voice guidance if an application has no speaker .
select a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
choose a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with one mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to sign the speaker in the list . order number of speakers for the list also determin@@ es its priority in the list .
click on this buttons to turn your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system , click on this buttons .
choose here one cable type , there are three male and three female votes as well as a young and child voice for a selection .
when you click here , click the new speaker on the box map . to change the settings of this speaker , click on edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts , and check whether voice guidance ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so it &apos;s possible to read the text file . see now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the map of orders to create text orders , and manage text orders .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the language system of &amp; K@@ DE ; click on the box card , to open the map card . here you can set some general options .
mark this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS @-@ Service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and can be read the text orders and can be found . see the marking , K@@ TT@@ SD is applied and the T@@ TS @-@ System from &amp; K@@ DE is disabled .
if kt@@ t@@ gr will be finished , &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue , if the field is able to activate the box ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ gr appears automatically in the system range of the control bar , it appears once again once the pre @-@ read is completed .
with the buttons in this series you can start text orders , break , stopping , and start again .
with the buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; K@@ DE ; intermediate position can be read or read a text file to read out . you also have to change the speaker for a job .
click on the or OK , then all modified settings are taken on all pages .
the orders of orders will only be shown if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the box card General , and to activate the voice guidance ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; K@@ DE ; check out the text of the requested website . check out the text , be read , and select the main menu tools . after a short time , the language edition should be started .
it is almost always meaning@@ ful to mark the desired text of a website . you can ski@@ p this step even though there are many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ head@@ lines and other invisible brands also read .
check out in &amp; K@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; K@@ DE ; check out the text you can read it ; then select the text , the pre @-@ read , and then select the main menu tool . then the language edition should be started .
this also works if &amp; K@@ ate ; in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ No@@ tify is the news system of &amp; K@@ DE ; that you can disc@@ lose any interest rates . you can read the text of this news also by &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation , the I@@ RC program of &amp; K@@ DE ; for example , you can submit several types of messages , if you enter the message in an I@@ RC channel , you &apos;ll be found on your Nick@@ i name ; then you can read the I@@ RC news text .
supports one &amp; K@@ DE programme , a menu entry , appears al@@ erts on the menu of this program . here the possible settings for K@@ No@@ tify this program is different from the application .
filters out the encoding itself is a good opportunity to correct but it &apos;s a good example . if the file is able to correct e @-@ mail . it is a good example . you &apos;ll find the tags of your e @-@ mail , and also the expression of the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed to be accepted as required in most cases . read it also
filter are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not needed .
in Fil@@ ters it will be sent to text before he sent to the program for an extension . it is useful to replace the words or to replace a right language or to select a right language or to select a specific source of language syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their voices .
to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; cable @-@ hi@@ cher &quot; works with a text . it distinguishes four types of texts .
the issue of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be drag@@ ged to all other elements . if the issue of the screen reader is read , the required orders will be re@@ sum@@ ed again .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; the processor has preced@@ ence and holds the issue of messages and normal text . these orders will be re@@ sum@@ ed after the issue of warning .
news have the following priority of normal text . &amp; mouth mouth , an example for an application , the news is used . if you are looking for a long text , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone welcome to the room . &amp; K@@ DE ; al@@ erts are also news . read this news .
the rest are simple text orders . every order to give you a text orders . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that uses the text orders . text orders are intended for the output of a text texts , which have no special deriv@@ atives .
all four order types are processed in waiting @-@ long , with the exception of the screen Screen Re@@ aders . if an application has the issue of a Screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just how to read , this issue will hold and finished .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the issue of Screen @-@ reduc@@ ers . you will be applied to normal resource , news and text orders , as well as on &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News .
filter edit the text and give it to the next filter . at present , there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , it can still be further types of filters .
drawing parts of a text by other text . the parts can be used either as words or regular expres@@ sions , allowing the creation of chat emotions ( as : - ) by Text or for the re@@ form@@ att@@ ing of messages from &amp; con@@ sen@@ ation ; or &amp; K@@ Mail ; in a better shape form .
&amp; XML file use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format , are included in the scope of delivery ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
depending on the content of the text , the text may be sent , depending on the box , and sent to a speaker . if you have , for example , if you have a female voice , you can read the text of K@@ DE messages , you can read the text of K@@ DE messages .
each of these various filter has adjustable rules , according to which he is applied for a voice guidance . if the filter is that its rules are not able to meet its rules and remains unchanged at the next filter .
if a text job , a message or a &amp; K@@ DE ; notification in &amp; kt@@ ts , it is sent by all activated filters which were built on the side down . the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this is shown the list of the standard normal filter . if a filter does not cross @-@ crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filters the series is pulled down from top to below .
click here to add a new filter . select the type of fil@@ tering , and there will be the following information di@@ alog@@ ues below .
for the installation of strings set filters , you have to enter a list of words or regular intervals . this pattern is changed in the text , then the text is exchanged for the associated replacement text . big and small dish will not be replaced by comparison .
specify a name for your filter a name . that name you can choose from anywhere in the name of the other filters , only by the names of the other filters .
this is the list of the words of the words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column , and replaced it in accordance with the string chain from the column . the list is used in the sequence from top to below .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can upload a list of words or regular press from a file to delete the current list , or delete the list of a file , the entries from the file to be hang@@ ed on the existing list .
here is a language entered , the filter is only applied if the spokes@@ person for the text is registered one of the languages . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select several languages when you hold the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button pressed .
if a value is entered , the filter is only applied , if the text is provided by one of the specified applications . you can set multiple programs separately by Com@@ mat@@ a . for example : con@@ junc@@ ation , K@@ Mail
the Application @-@ ID programs are available with the program q@@ dbus ; for example , &amp; dbus ; numbers have to be trac@@ tions . if for example &amp; q@@ dbus , the application @-@ ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 allows you to copy it .
the drawing filter is only applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box seal Filter , if all conditions are empty , if all input fields is empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing the words of the character set filters regular expres@@ sions in the form of \ \ s word \ \ . the words must be limited by divi@@ des ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no guidance for writing by regular press . if you have the &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; check &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; check out in the package of k@@ am@@ big@@ u@@ ls .
&amp; XML file trans@@ formers via X@@ SL@@ T files from one format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language and trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such versions . the aid program is x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , there is also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
you can also send text to a specific speaker , which is on the box map , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can read the text that texts by mail from a female voice can be read .
prior to the speaker , the spokes@@ person for the text is looking for a speaker . the speaker is the speaker according to the speaker . the spokes@@ person for the text is selected , and the properties tab on the card speaker . the spokes@@ person for the spokes@@ person for the spokes@@ person , the spokes@@ person for the spokes@@ person .
if a value is entered , the filter is applied in case that the text is used for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; press review , you can call this one click on the button to get assistance with the input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to an@@ cho@@ red the regular basis at the beginning of the string chain , i.e. , start the regular expression of &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place here the features of the desired column . if the text showed the above filter terms , the speaker is selected , the speaker is selected to indicate the desired requirements of the same . click on the button to indicate the dialog box selection .
use this buttons to store your skills settings or delete all settings .
the spokes@@ person filter is only applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter apply . you must have at least one condition .

with these sli@@ des@@ how you can adjust the volume , microphone speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you are not select the controller and select these grey you can &apos;t mean the voice of these settings .
some voices like multi@@ sy@@ n votes will need to be loaded by their size to multiple seconds . if you check this check@@ box , these voices will be loaded by K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( in case of larger memory fuel ) the first set is faster .
if this check box is not selected , you will not have a speaker ( or forget to click on the click ) .
if this is selected , this check box is indicated with the start of kt@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after start only the symbol is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to show the program window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ ro@@ gr do not appear , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD . thus , you have the possibility to read the pre @-@ reading or hand @-@ effective .
here are all orders listed in the waiting period , together with the application , which has set the contract , the number of sentences and the straight sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the box card .
using the kno@@ bs in this series , you can be selected in the list which is selected in the list below , pre @-@ go or returned . ( but not every contract is made of several sets ) .
with one click on OK , all changes of the settings are taken into account ( also on the other map cards ) and is reduced to the icon in the system section . click on this icon to show the program window .
if the sound@@ system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the box card .
here only text orders are listed and managed . spending by Screen @-@ reduc@@ ers , war@@ nings , and messages are not displayed . further information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts are found .
choose here the kind of audio output . if one component can not be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the corresponding Audi@@ om@@ o@@ or or save , the necessary libraries can not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ co@@ de for the audio output is to be used , select here the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to select at least one module . if you have AL@@ SA , select here the PCM device . see also
set the subscri@@ ber speed here . 50 % . % corresponds to half and 200@@ s ; % of the double line speed . so that this settings can be implemented , the program SO@@ X must be installed .
click the application to take the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices comprises all PCM devices and modules which are set in your system . most of them are not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device is working with you .
on this box map , you can set particular actions , which always be executed whenever the text assignment of a message with higher priority is interrupted . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes 4 types of language entries :
the issue of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be drag@@ ged to all other elements . after the issue of the screen reader has been read , the disabled orders will be taken again .
wait is the following priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved . a warning , the issue of news and norm@@ em text will be re@@ sum@@ ed . these orders will be re@@ sum@@ ed after reading the warning .
news have the next priority . &amp; mouth mouth , an example of an application breaks . &amp; mouth mouth , is an example of an application to read the news . if you &apos;re looking for a long text on a website , you can welcome them with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless I want to welcome them to the room .
if a message is interrupted by a message , warning or the issue of a Screen Re@@ aders , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the waiting for long .
this audio file is always played , if a normal text job will be interrupted . if both direc@@ ting sound is active as well as introduc@@ tory news , the introduc@@ tory sound is played in front of the first message .
the settings on this box map are only available for normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings , and spending by Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern , there is no special actions when they will be interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to be reading with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ No@@ tify News , start plug and click on al@@ erts on al@@ erts .
mark this cross@@ box to read the reading of &amp; K@@ DE ; however , this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no al@@ erts before .
if this setting is marked , al@@ erts are al@@ erts , where a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts , not read .
use this buttons to add some events to the list or delete them . if you click on the button , an dialog box , in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before being sent &amp; con@@ sen@@ ation ; if someone is mentioned in an I@@ RC message to your Nick@@ i name .
all events , for which in the list nothing else , are ignored , are ignored , are ignored .
use this selection box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if a event meets a event . they have the following selection :
if you read the user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following space holder :
you can set the characteristics of the required microphone . standard cho@@ oses the speaker from the list , which is displayed in the list on the map card as an upper entry . see also , click here .
note that there are three levels for events . if the action is specified for a specific application of a specific application . otherwise , the action is defined for all other events of the specified application . the last possibility is set up the action to be used under standard ( all other events ) .
the event View all al@@ erts for the application ( all other events can &apos;t be deleted from the list . for this purpose , you can specify the pre @-@ mentioned noti@@ fications as follows :
use the button to store the settings for the noti@@ fications to al@@ erts on a file . if you want to use the events in the list . if you want to begin with a empty list , click on soldering . all entries are deleted from all the problems .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standards for the control of voices , the sound speed , the volume of the voice and the pitch . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , a further W@@ 3C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you have to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , as it is the default value , the festival in the issue of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or recording in the festival configuration dialog will not be adjusted to 100@@ n@@ ex % , SS@@ ML text is usually captured very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two types of filters - a normal filter and set @-@ level detection . thus , too , the first set must be syn@@ thesi@@ zed , not the whole text job . thus , you can also keep on the map material , even if the language syn@@ thesizer would not be directly supported .
here you see the set @-@ level filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , the set is set automatically set up . you can change the settings or add additional set @-@ related filters , but it is rounded off .
the sim@@ pl@@ est learn the device selection , and check the text selection . check out the comments selection , and select some features and check out the selection of speakers . you need to set more than a speaker , the filter is un@@ effective , otherwise the filter is not effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then you can read faster with the pre @-@ read , because the first set must be processed and not the whole text block which can last for a long time ,
in order to keep text orders on the map of orders or break , even if the language syn@@ thesizer this function does not support this function .
for this purpose , the normal movement is set automatically set , if you start portable gr for the first time . it cannot be wired , only away . change nothing to this filter , unless you know what you do .
the instruction manual ( Dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) is set to set up a tab ( Dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the set of filters automatically from the text ) . note that the standard set @-@ level filter is set to the character set .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News ( cold ) , war@@ nings , News or the issue of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern .
if you have to set the normal movement @-@ level filter , you can add this again by using the standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c file .
on the box map , you can write the spokes@@ person for the application . the map card is displayed , if
use of the default device ( the top on the map speaker ) . in other words , there are no effects characteristics .
use of the matching microphone station , which has all the features of a furnished speaker . if you don &apos;t have the settings of the microphone or edit , cho@@ oses the speaker . otherwise , cho@@ oses the speaker , the spokes@@ man that was originally designed for use .
select the method for entering the desired application characteristics by clicking on one of the select buttons .
choose here the characteristics of the required microphone . if this feature is no role , enter nothing one .
mark this check box when the property rang in front of other properties , you may also set several mark@@ ings here .
since the language includes a critical factor during the course of the issue , this property is rarely be used . if you want to specify this property , if you may know , if you may know that a specific application will be sent in another language than that of the working environment .
in order to use all the characteristics in the field , the following is to ext@@ ingu@@ ish , click on the select button speaker and then on speakers of the following is the following .
in this case , 0 stands for the last text job in the waiting time . you can also specify a order number . ( excluding order number is the input 0 required ) .
kt@@ t@@ gr over@@ threw it when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I do not get back guarantee .
G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is not yet completed ; if the problem is not solved with G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x , the command of G@@ ST register is not resolved , possibly a not compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update G@@ Stre@@ amer or un@@ install or un@@ install .
the audio output via AL@@ SA will not work when I play with other application music games . if I connect a text job , fri@@ ert &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message appears on the &amp; console ; a message appears on this &amp; console .
on your system the problem is that conflicts at AL@@ SA will perform the same opening of several PCM devices . information for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ P@@ ect@@ .org .
I have loaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use them in festival , but kt@@ sm@@ gr shows this voice .
add the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / Vo@@ ices is added to the new voice . if you successfully serve the other entries , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL , where you have found the voice to the developers .
on the box card , there is an adjustment speed . so this work , the program SO@@ X has to be able to connect to the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some Syn@@ thesi@@ zers as the festival Interactive offer a setting for speed on the card device . depending on the selected voice , this is active or in@@ active .
select the microphone is ignored , if it is controlled . SS@@ ML has its own tags for converting &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are mu@@ zzle , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ after SS@@ ML data filter , and set up the microphone speed up .
I made it not that websites can be read with a female voice . I have a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta does not work the day S@@ able Gender does not work . so the festival does not have any mistakes , the X@@ SL file is converting to S@@ aber the gender tags . the equ@@ als also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added an own strings kit and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more s@@ atin orders can be displayed , or reset . on the box orders will appear only from a set . what do I do wrong ?

G@@ Stre@@ amer ( version 0.@@ 8.7 or later . note : make sure that the modules for G@@ Stre@@ amer are registered in &amp; kt@@ ts , by the command of G@@ ST register . ( HTTP : / / g@@ able ) .
some users may experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio output . if your system can also be playing music , and play a text when you start a text message and then start another . possible solutions for this problem , you will find it on the website from AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
at stand in July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not yet support a real break . if you hold a text job in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set is still read more pre @-@ read .
the audio program SO@@ X is used for the general adjustment of the microphone speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install SO@@ X with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install SO@@ X . the program is on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .
have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts ; as a tar@@ ball ( with tar packs ) you can download it as a normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a matching folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4 , the module &amp; arts ; probably removed , or at least only on the requirement .
the following modules for language syn@@ thesizer are created as standard . some of them have a run @-@ time limit of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free to the guidelines of the Deb@@ ian distribution ) , and configure an option to configure the pass through the transfer of the transfer .
as default , it is installed &amp; kt@@ ts ; in / op@@ / k@@ de@@ 3 installed , this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify --@@ pre@@ fix = target . for example

before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; you &apos;ll first check if your language syn@@ thesizer properly works right . follow the instructions that you have with the Syn@@ thesizer .
the top of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the votes will be good , and there are several voices and languages . with many voices , you can adjust the volume , microphone speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you need to install a language at least one language . help you want to read it with the festival . if you want to read more web pages , you have to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone .
for those voices you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German votes are subject to limitations with the transfer .
this voice uses the festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ pack the software in the festival / li@@ b _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . choose a k@@ yri@@ an ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux + distri@@ butions . pick the Festival as first on the CDs by your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option must be set up to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ ll@@ ical such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA system ; this creates the le@@ xi@@ an Analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA . this creates the output audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA facility ; the program can be downloaded from

this manual features the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ stations ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the management of network interfaces , the routine and the DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings on a single , integrated surface . the &amp; t@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called upon selection of K menu @-@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allow the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; thus creating a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installing a new module settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selection of k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ men@@ ù ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware not need to install . physical devices and their drivers have already installed and configured , thus &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is possible and enables setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed on the software hardware and set up . network devices have later added , the drivers must be loaded by adap@@ table to the following files , according to the kernel version :
the module network settings will be loaded when the network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Index is selected . when the module &apos;s network settings tries to automatically detect the installed platform on the system .
if the platform is not recognized , the platform is offered . it is the platform from the list , select the distribution and relev@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and best . due to mark@@ ings of non @-@ again questions , the definition can be met again . in the next Start of network settings , this option will be automatically pre@@ set .
change of network settings are possible only in the system management mode . previously , all options are displayed , which means you can only be viewed . in the system management mode , you will need in the system management mode at the right end of the module . it is necessary to input the password .
in the system management mode the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
the rider network interface serves for the management of network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . by the rider network interfaces , the following tasks can be carried out :
the settings are set to set up a selection of the required device in the list , and click on the button to set up in the dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click on the button for the dialog with a wide range of possibilities .
the TCP / IP server are collected by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP servers , all the TCP / IP information for each system start , therefore no additional setting is required . in the select list either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system .
the TCP / IP address can be carried out by your TCP / IP address . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field , the sub@@ net@@ mask set the sub@@ net@@ mask set .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alized the network interface in the boats . if the initi@@ alization is not wish , this option should not be activated .
the values set in this dialogue is displayed as properties of the device in the device .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not used for an TCP / IP address . with ping in the &amp; con@@ sole , you can find whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network is to be asked in doubt .
network devices can be activated or switched off . saving one @-@ off network device is activated by a selection of the list and click from the interface .
network devices can be activated or switched off . use of a activated network device is activated by a selection of the list and click from the interface .
the IP address of the bil@@ ers in local sub@@ net , which connects the physical connection to remote networks and is used as standard for TCP / IP communication with bil@@ ls in other sub@@ network .
if your computer has more than a network interface , the interface must be selected on the net , in which the Gateway computer is selected .
a computer with DNS support will be replaced by the corresponding IP address . if the computer htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org calls upon request , tri@@ ggers this name into an IP address such as about 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator has to be changed to a resolution of the equ@@ alizer and allows a simple management of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified .@@ DNS entries can be arranged according to a selection of one contract or down@@ gra@@ dation in the list using the buttons or down into the priority .
by clicking the button of adding ... from the batch conversion , a DNS server can be added to a DNS server . the dialog box is displayed .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then add the knob . the entry will then add in the list .
from the batch conversion to a resolution , select an entry and click on the button 1 .... It will display the dialog box .
the list is known as the calcul@@ ator @-@ to @-@ address IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . if no DNS server is available for use . in small , closed networks can replace it as a DNS server .
usually , the list is known as a number of entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses are needed . this is still in the future version of IP in the future .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known host and click on adding .... The dialog for the New Ali@@ as is displayed .
the name of the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator and enter the button . if the well @-@ known computers may enter the name of multiple ali@@ as name , the button adding several times and enter the other alien names .
select an entry of an especially known calcul@@ ator made from the list , and select editing .... The dialog in the computer is displayed .
there may be one of the following tasks are executed , then with An@@ t OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the module settings in the module settings can not be effective immediately in the system . to enable the changes , must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command can be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; isn &apos;t htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , which you can download the latest version of the source text .
for installation of the binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , if &amp; K@@ DE , and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced user . it is just the rpm package to download and download in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively a tool can be used with graphic interface , such as a package or installation tool of its distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE is sufficient for this case , but also requires the development plan with libraries and for other things .
this is only experienced by experienced users . however , it &apos;s not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should help you .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about fundamental network technology are given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; modified configuration files .
this area can not replace more than IP networks . in this app@@ endix we can only replace basic information about the integration of the PC in a small ( home @-@ home network ) .
IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 5 has never been found . IPv6 is expected that it is in the near future . this description focuses on the widespread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is to assign the knowledge that the IP address of a network interface is to be ordered . in any case , D@@ H@@ CP may not be used , your IP address can not be chosen from any case .
when using a own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a address to the global ( Internet ) network to prevent IP address under the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded on the Internet .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by adjusting a gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks are usually used in the range from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the mask mask usually is set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the standard route is required for the IP forwarding .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in local own machine . usually the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .

&amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; is an application where you can run other programs on a schedule in the background . it &apos;s a graphical interface for the &amp; UNIX ; system program cr@@ on .
with the Start &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; see a list of tasks and da@@ zz@@ ling environment variable . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , it will be used both for all users of the system as well as for system @-@ internal tasks . each folder can be processed and fold .
in a de@@ activated task , programm@@ name and parameters are not displayed and activated by description .
the quality environment variable set the otherwise existing environment variable for all the listed tasks apart from force . with a de@@ activated variable appears as a description .
to create a new task in order to create a new task , then select a new record in the menu . then you can also select the right mouse button on the tasks folder , and select in the context menus menu Neu ... select or C@@ tr@@ l ; N press .
enter here the name of the programme . you can either specify a relative or absolute sc@@ ad@@ name . if you want to check out the program first you want to choose from ....
select the minute ( n ) , to which the task should be carried out . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can specify the minutes in fifth steps .
if you select both Mon@@ at@@ day ( e ) as well as week@@ day ( e ) , the program will be carried out both at the same date as well as on the 1st and 15th of the chosen months of each week , and will also be on every Sunday of the month , no matter what date they fall .
as with the creation of new tasks , changes are only active when the c@@ ron@@ tab was stored .

alternatively , you can select the right mouse button on the variables file and Neu ... select , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; N .
enter the name of variables a . you can also select one from the list of the most frequently used environment variable ; click on the arrow next to the box for the vari@@ etal names .
to send an e @-@ mails from the programme , to send an other than the normal address .
as with the creation of new variables only , changes are made , when the c@@ ron@@ tab was stored .
in order to cut a variable , then select the variable variable . go out to editing .
to copy a environment variable , select first the copy @-@ variable . go then to edit copying .
alternatively , you can select the right mouse button to select the variable button , copying or press C@@ tr@@ l ; C .
to add a environment variable , first must be cut to cut or copy . only then the option is available for all . select the variables folder . go then to edit the variables .
to modify a variable to change it , you can select the right mouse button on the Variable button and modify ... choose , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; O .@@ It appears to be the dialog in the dialog box , in which you can edit the variable .
to delete the variable variable in order to remove the variable . go then to edit a variable .
to activate a environment variable or to de@@ ac@@ ti@@ te , select them , and place the condition with the menu item editing . for a de@@ activated variable appear under description .
alternatively , you can also select the right mouse button on the Variable button and activation . make sure the name and value of variables are given correctly .
if all tasks and environment variable can be entered or changed , you need to store the c@@ ron@@ tab file . select the menu item Save .
alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S press . changes or supplements to tasks or variables only are active .
it appears the standard K@@ DE ; printer dialog . if you choose to choose that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options at the dialog box .
prints the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have advanced permission missions .
cr@@ on , for example vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the users of the user .
a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; used standard commands of &amp; UNIX , to learn time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; this is the possibility to create several archives on the basis of tar . it also offers the ability to remove the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar to a fast , selective un@@ pack . the second goal was to answer my wife : how much longer goes to do it ?
before a tape can be used , it must be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; the can be done on three types :
&amp; k@@ dat ; the band returns and reads the pre @-@ out information of the band . recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the band will not be requested on the tape , you will need to be form@@ att@@ ed whether the tape should be form@@ att@@ ed .
automatically det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; if you are searching for the right index of your plate . cannot be found , if the band index will be newly created .
if everything has gone smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive to show that the band has been incorporated . in the status bar , the content of the band can be searched for the band that can be searched for the band .
before departure of the Ban@@ des , the integration must be solved in the integration . there are three methods to apply this to apply .
&amp; k@@ dat ; there is a change of symbol for the band to detect the integration for the band and shows a corresponding announcement in the status bar . the band can now be subjected to a risk without danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be used , it must be form@@ att@@ ed by &amp; k@@ dat ;
a belt card must be form@@ att@@ ed before you can use the tape before you need to check out the tape before you have to be form@@ att@@ ed before the tape before you &apos;re form@@ att@@ ed . flo@@ ppy band works usually need a shape of the band , DA@@ T drives on the other hand .
after entering the band called and the capacity , &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format part of the band . all dates on the band is lost ! after completion of the form@@ att@@ ing process , the band is automatically adapted and is ready for use .
before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the secured files . this can happen to three types :
choose a file or file in local file tree . it is backed by this file or the folder secured .
mark a key profile for tree in the tree . only the files are secured by the profile of the files .
mark files in local file tree with a ham@@ lets . only the selected files and / or sub@@ ord@@ ner are secured .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select the menu of Sich@@ uan ...
once the backup was initiated , the dialog box for backup . in this dialogue , you can check the selected files and the settings for backup .
when you have confirmed the settings to safegu@@ arding the dialog box , the dialog box shows the progress of the backup process including data rate and the remaining time .
mark a file or a folder in one of the archives created for the drive . it will only be tested for the selected file or the folder .
mark the files in one of the archives on the band for the band with a ham@@ lets . only the selected files and / or sub@@ ord@@ ner are tested .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry . ...
once the test procedure was started , the dialog box for verification . in this dialogue you can check your selection and check the work regulations for the review .
when you confirmed the settings for the verification , the dialog test is checked out . this dialogue shows the progress of the test process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can open the files , the files must be restored , marked and marked . this can be carried out two types :
select a file or file in one of the archives created for the tape drive . it will only be restored to the selected file or sub@@ ord@@ ner .
mark the desired files from one of the archives with a ham@@ lets . it &apos;s only restored the files and / or sub@@ ord@@ ner .
click with the right mouse button on a file or a folder in one of the archives and select the menu recovery ....
once the re @-@ run process started , the dialog box for recovery . in this dialogue you can check your selection and check the work folders for recovery .
when you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog box will appear . this dialogue shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes , it is necessary to create the band index@@ ed file using the band@@ in@@ hal@@ tes . this procedure is used to create all existing index files for this band . you can create the index to two types of new band :
as a result , a re@@ viewing profile is created with the just marked files and the default settings . you can customi@@ ze for a critical profile for the following settings :
the current working hours , in which the backup is to be carried out . the list of the secured files will be automatically updated according to the just elected working work .
for all folders , which are listed under the backup files , can be found on the same file system , such as the folder , which can be found on other fil@@ esystem , can be viewed separately on the backup files . each entry is independent of the files independent from the other .
perform a in@@ cre@@ denti@@ fied backup . to verify that files are changed since the last in@@ credit backup , a sn@@ ake file is used . only the files are secured , which have changed since then .
the name of the file , which is used to ensure the changes of changes since the last in@@ credit card .
sol@@ dered the sn@@ ail file against the command of tar . this causes that all files will be secured and a new sn@@ ail file for the next backup is laid out .
the functionality of the buttons &amp; gt ; ; and lt ; if necessary , files was not implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can set up your menu item K@@ D@@ at menu in the menu of the menu . the following settings can be :
the full path to the device storage for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path has to refer to the non @-@ re@@ lics of the band@@ ry .
this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band works the command load to the drive . if some drives are necessary , before read or write operations .
if the option is switched on , &amp; k@@ dat ; the design of the tape drive is locked . possibly , this setting does not work in all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically the tape is done automatically . use this option to flo@@ ppy drive .
is the option to change &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ size block size for the tape drive is not necessary . no matter whether this setting is active or not you need to use &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your band works .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band @-@ format , writes it a file to the start of the band . this file should only show a memory block on the band . the content of the file sets up as follows :
the tape @-@ ID . the format of this string is bil@@ name : seconds , the name of the complete name of the system is format on which the band was form@@ att@@ ed . seconds is the number of seconds who have passed since the period have been form@@ att@@ ed .
the band @-@ ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the other files on the band are pure tar @-@ Archive that can directly manage directly with &amp; GNU , allowing you to tar , even other tar versions should work , as long as it does not require in@@ credit card .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a band is integrated .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log is a &amp; K@@ DE ; viewing for system protocols . the program is intended for non @-@ experienced users or where the system has the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users with fast access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computer in the background . is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of the own system . the program is suitable for experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system has the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log has experienced users with quick access for example on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log is trying to provide some advanced functions , which can be fil@@ tered with the help of the protocol files .
in current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a series of useful functions . among other things , among others :
support for many different types of protocol files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included in the other chapters of this Hand@@ book .
as you can see in the following screen photo , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available , with the help of the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily filters and sorted them in the next chapter of this Hand@@ book .
after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log has been to open the system protocol , and it will not open a small news file , so you &apos;ll find &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; the protocol files can be found under Linux in the folder / var / log , for the normal users don &apos;t have any authorization to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter the filter bar , which can be displayed automatically according to the selected filter . in the standard setting , the selection box is displayed on the filter . then a protocol line will only be displayed , if in one of the columns shall contain the drawing chain of the filter search engine .
you can also select another entry into the column of course . select the column in the protocol file system protocol , and you can also select the column in the filter bar , which shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent from this process or create .
this option is enabled in the default setting , and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . minutes lines of the stage are displayed with one eye @-@ tested color as a protocol lines of the stage . the coloured representation of the protocol lines can be switched on .
would you only want to display certain process ( for example in the system protocol or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , for example , you can check the process identification ( P@@ ID ) , for example , if you wish to examine the issue of a specific findings as for example the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you can use filter bar .
in addition , you can ski@@ p the option of new lines in the context menu of the main menu , to let all the new upcoming protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of several protocol files in separate windows . to open this function , use the entries in the window to open and manage your window onto the menu window as soon as you select a signature , select a protocol for the display .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has an own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum software version .@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you find additional information about the processing sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log is also found in the following folder of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Subversion Archi@@ ves : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Archi@@ ves
welcome to &amp; K@@ DE ; System V Par@@ t Editor , rather known ( and in the following ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section is a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; do you see .
the V 2009 system develops rapidly to the standard for the control of the program at the end of the system in the &amp; Linux ; therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful and more flexible is more flexible than the traditional BSD style .
I will not continue to go on historical aspects ( among others because I don &apos;t know anything else : - ) .
the hur@@ t @-@ binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is why because someone could try out a machine on the V @-@ file , without a new installation and re @-@ form@@ att@@ ed file . that is why you need to be sure that the old hur@@ dle is removed from there , if there was there .
the SY@@ SV For@@ t distinguishes itself from the BSD Ini@@ t that the configuration files can be found in a sub@@ ord@@ ner of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole amount of scripts . in principle you need a script for each system service . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; s@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ pd &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things such as set@@ ring , which is only once again . such calls are to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local , if you need it . most systems have this file , even if it is not a lot of use . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ 2 in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a bit more , what do you do with the serial port .
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first that it finds it .
the standard runtime level is in / etc / in@@ activation . you should see in the starting range one line as the following :
on this point you can view a look at the second column you can change / etc / in@@ itt@@ ance of hand and you can change your needs . if you have something else if you &apos;re connected to changes , then you will need to start the system , rest@@ art the following :
but how do it starts all the right scripts ? if you enter the l @-@ l @-@ in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder no proper files are here . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory .
as starts and stops in it , system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is so written that it &apos;s a argument such as start and stop . you can actually start this scripts on the command line as follows :
this would be the htt@@ pd server to keep it . in@@ it reads the name , and if the script will call it with the argument . if it includes an S , the script will be called by the argument .
some people wish to set a simple way to create machines for many purposes . I could have htt@@ pd , &amp; s@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also run a user @-@ level level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ;
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; you should not have very difficult because the program was made as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or any other hand tool is easy to say , not to say , make sure a entry from the area of availability system services to one of the six runtime in order to start him on this level ( or stop to stop ) .
you can also change scripts between runtime or position within one level , by making it very different . this is the entry from its original run @-@ level ( or its position ) . this is not only if they draw an entry from the area of availability system services .
note that entries should be moved in a new area . to copy them in a new run @-@ level , you need to select any copy from the menu , or in the target range , even if the same entry had already exists in the target range of the action .
the sorption is@@ able of a single order can not be calculated sometimes , in such a case you need to make the sorption values of the surrounding entries before you can try to put the system service .
please note : at the moment there is no possibility of entries that were thrown into the paper bag . so be careful not to be careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ulator key to enable the various working areas ( available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to meet a selection of Upper or below the previous one .
to move one entry into another level level in order to move it into the intermediate level ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired runtime level ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the Sor@@ ti@@ ern@@ ing or the name of an agreement manually , press the battery button to switch between different fields . join the dialog for the loading of the input -@@ button to accept changes , or press Es@@ c to cur@@ b the changes .
because of the danger of data loss , all entries in the menu file require confirmation , before they will be executed .
all settings are taken in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ c . default the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ c ) are taken . otherwise they are restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; restored . changes to the pre@@ adjustments are stored in a local sy@@ no@@ sv@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ levels , and now the machine is new . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in individual user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ance and change the standard Run@@ level on a reasonable value ( 3 should usually be in order ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it is intended to run under Run@@ level X , but they will not be executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) , then you have to edit extra files in / etc , which only need in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
this species , such as system services will be started to be simplified as system services in this distribution , but is unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; planning an extension to the program for this approach .
if you are using any other distribution , please check whether all configuration files are required ( and even if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ pd ) is not able to finish your configuration files not available or wrong .
the importance of the &amp; Linux distribution level varies from distribution to distribution , if you use any other distribution , please send us any other distribution please send us about the runtime level , so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter of &amp; k@@ user ; read more
after you have made changes , you have to save this . either use the respective icon of the tool bar or entry in the menu file .
&amp; k@@ user is an easy use . the main window is made up of two card cards , the user and the user troop @-@ List . for editing , select the desired user or the desired group with double clicking on entry . it appears to be the dialog @-@ user or group properties .
some box cards are only represented if you have extended system settings ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , it will be added to individual settings ; if you have individual box cards , if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master .@@ pass@@ w@@ d can be installed as BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the anti@@ trust authority appears , if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes .
this card card appears only if a built @-@ in order intake ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( can be seen on the file / user / quot@@ as group ) . here you can changes every user parameters , whereby the space limits can be changed in KB :
these parameters can be set individually adjusted for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system .
the map groups also informs about the group &apos;s group throughout the group . the default group is to be found in the primary group . the user can continue to become a member in the field of primary group . the user can mark the user in other groups by clicking this in the large field .
the dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , mark this users on the list .
to add a user or a group , add a user or group , or click on the right adding button of the tool bar . editing or soldering of the selected users or the selected group works analog@@ ous .
with this module , you can remove the L@@ ILO Boot@@ Manager , remove the boot @-@ password , remove the time until the boats of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , remove , change operating systems , change and more .
