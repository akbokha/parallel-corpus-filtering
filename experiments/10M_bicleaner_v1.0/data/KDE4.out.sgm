<seg id="154">The separation from original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know whether you are looking for an original or retrieval picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option of metadata to the back side of the metadata and the IPTC data in the file. if you forget this, then you can save the metadata from the database in the files by clicking the menu in the menu album.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens you want to change? s & digious, there is a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you should select any photo passwords, you need to select all the pictures and then set the value. you will make sense at the top with the rating or the leaderboard. this makes sense because you can concentrate on the best photos on the other.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us take us with keywords, keywords, as you continue with other programs, are hot, or categories. all three are Synonyme for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you want to add an alogist images from a different source, import them to the right place. the conversion of the Hierarchy within the building is no problem and can be done by means of a subtree to another splitters; the modified sample may be followed by & digious; updates the lower trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows as different metadata. this is a very rough representation of representation since each block of metadata in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar features are characteristics of all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough passwords - the next section refers to labelling or comments, the third important tool to catalyze your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to see most niches your photos just see, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are interested in interested like your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance of Ferne is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look closer and then start some details, people, who place the square.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say you the site of the Landepot der Allied & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy, memories, the historical time period is again present, you may also hear the silence of this panoramic position, so your perception has been completely changed.</seg>
<seg id="165">For other pictures, the title may be more important than the image to create a great interest. remember that key is the meaning of the viewing that the key is to help you about the motif which you want to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is in order if a picture is not perfect if the strength has only work with a label for themselves alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & delivery; you can export a copy of any text in a internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), then you can export him to your wishes for your wishes and / or the title of Web Galeriesystems. so you have to tell you a second time for the opening hours.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find any other city without navigation system? it was not a long Planet from GoogleEarth? good, because with pictures, the train of the spatial presentation now already includes light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">You can take advantage of the options in the future. I am sure that you can repeat your journeys with geographic data. you can also export the photos on the shooting location. you can also export the pictures and export them to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and referred the practice of copyright laws to remove limitations on the distribution and change of copies. the same liberties also apply to all modified versions, thus also for the work of other.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you about information in the home page of & digious; as information can be deposited as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for author and author): this field should add your name, or the name of the photographer, for example, the name of a company or organization can be used. if it did not have to be changed. this field does not need to be changed. this field does not support semi-colon as a separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author's author (synonymous with the author): together with the author. this field contains the work name of the photographer. examples include a freelance photographer, freelance photographer or a kind of commercial photographer. since this is a link to the author, it must be filled this also.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for information): do not use the author for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then you can see the picture here. if the picture is a storage photo, then the group / agency offers the picture shows here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although it's no protection against abuse. each of them is a digital watermark. for private persons, this protection is only very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and half-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique in the image. & take delivery; it is provided in the near future a such module for stacking processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: plate error, turnout, power supply, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, Desastervorce, life time, temperature, data size,</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we talk about CDs that have lost here on the street or a fire. this kind of caps are also the same in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it is about problems with the so-called Neue Medien.</seg>
<seg id="179">Croll Ontrack, the biggest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics which causes a loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to combat the problem with CD / DVDs, you can also hold more than a few years. of course, you can also hold the CDs and DVDs. there are also offers a gold-coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 copies of a life time of 100 years for himself. if you believe that believe it is in your legs.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you can do good discs and good recording devices. the best DVD movie devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you can write a lot of reliable. it turns into the right choice.</seg>
<seg id="182">CD and DVDs are very vulnerable to errors, even if you have just written a control mechanism to protect the rest we needed for the formatting and control. despite this massive protective coating it needs through chemical Alholder, ultra-violet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a convenient program called for hardware and DVDs. it runs on Windows and & Linux. however, there is no similar applications for damaged fixed disk disks, hard drives, Flashmedia, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to gain the HD DVD to win the HD DVD player. a dual-player Blu-ray disk can store up to 50 GB, and it was possible to use CDs and DVDs. all of course, the Blu-ray disk can also be used for the Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn the data back to high quality media in one of the high quality media. read the data you want to check the media with a description, dark dry and dry conditions. do not forget the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest hardware or software which can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Diskmanufacturers keep your statistics for themselves. their manufacturer guarantees a new disk, but not the data. Google represents a big field study on the error of mechanisms of hard disks: disk error study</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly, Disks keep the most common bug in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The error code of the controller are not possible. some of SMART specified the error. these are in particular reading and publishing counter. the expected time period is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">It is only about the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course, you can also protect the files due to a electricity if you decide to restore the files, but this losses can be used without great problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices can do not be much, the devices can be different from devices with computer chips and high-speed devices. these can cause them to cause them to cause two wires, motherboards, motherboards and other defects. thus, in front of the inevitable, which leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against current tips is a high voltage protection. this is a device that a part of the energy is absorbed and it is usually available in the form of a plug-in. do not think that any plug-in power is also available.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for a high voltage protection, then you should pay attention to UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a specific minimum of protection. you should also pay attention to protect the protection against lightening strikes and thus protects the right connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As an overvoltage of any cable you can use it to your system, you should also be protected from your system. some manufacturers provide high voltage scanners, which also contain a telephone connection for your modem. other offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specifically designed for notebooks, and therefore very small and you are also included the protection for the modem. this means that you are ideal for road.</seg>
<seg id="194">While a high-voltage protection keeps your system in front of smaller waverings in the power lines, it will not help you to increase the loss of unwanted data. so, it can be meaningful in an uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection from overtensions, these devices allow them to save up to the system. some models allow them to save your data and even further. if you need to use the same quality standards such as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the life time of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concerns the potential risk to prevent your computer system. a high quality high voltage protection can be applied up to & euros; 20 costs, A 500W USV can be used for you as well as your computer. at the end, you should remember to keep all cables to trenne before you go into the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - an easy storage service. with the correct configuration, you can use this as a drive for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer to store up data to any data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are very expensive in comparison to the hard drives are very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs $500. in addition, you have to send the data on the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore only available as a solution against a local loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it's no general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo Community 23hq.com offers online storage services on photos. the professional variant offers you more in full resolution online in case of flickr more. for $25 a year you get unlimited memory, which should be checked in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From point of view of the data backup, the web solutions are very safe. due to the TCP protocol automatically and with the large companies, it is included in the offer to backup and a partial memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the file systems and btrfs make sure the data integrity between the operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst right is that no one doesn't matter if it's not a transmission error. it is quite surprising that there is no protection in your computer. no one seems to be thought to have no protection. the internet with its TCP protocol is a considerably more safe data away than the machine in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are a further source for transmission losses, since they generate interferences within the data flows. in normal file systems these error remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently customizable for storage devices, you should look at the future. you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seem to be one of two candidates to be able to handle on low level and is available under an GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will be available for Linux; and Windows is available. read this article on English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is the same protective mechanisms of up the zfs and is also available for & Linux; yet it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not estimate that these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in notebook and 46%. in notebooks, the percentage of theft-steels is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">The loss of viruses is less common than the chissts. it is currently being limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know only very few viruses and under & Linux; none of them have been taken over a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to loss of proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS, is minimal better than ext3, Reiss Fs, JFS and XFS to call the most common file systems. you find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems causes corrupt data and data: wrong, only the speed of the examining process for a surgery is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely stored before the problem was lost, she lost it.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the largest threat for digital data: false, theft and human errors are the main causes for loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 bluetooth settings of fundamental physical limitations. however, the technology continued to develop a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go up in the direction of 10 megapixelsensres. even if this resolution is ideal for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixel cameras. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You will get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euros; so you do not make your data often according to a plan and try to secure your data like the new installation of your operating system, replacement of records or the size of the hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, one day, a flash memory, you don't have any luck if the drive was not connected in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A desaster proposes locally up and destroyed a lot. forgotten pilot: fire, water, electricity, children and theories are dangerous for your data. they usually need a whole room or the complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, Desasterpreventive always means a local store. bring your fuses the steps up to the neighbour's house, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for a loss in spite of backup the panic. if you have a backup on the backup, then you can save the one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup to all files are secured. we are a Momcilman without history and represents a complete copy at one time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential services: secure the files that have been changed since the last complete safety devices. this creates a complete response image for two time points: the full-scale protection and the latest differential protection.</seg>
<seg id="222">Searching for backup: back to the files which have been changed since the last backup. you can easily back up the original status at any time. this backup is coming to any time with the exception that there is only abgetastet with the exception that it is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool which can be easily copied to your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP, such as the difference of files saved. this happens compressed if you would like to increase the safety of safety via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important images directly after you have stored on your computer on a DVD or another optic medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure can be done enough time to discover losses and back. at the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly working consumption for at least one month and a Momcilo for each month. each additional function should be done manually after which you have a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, in image file saved IPTC information, associated XMP files, memory, scalability, media, relics of images and metadata, copy the pictures to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,...</seg>
<seg id="227">Thus precious pictures the next 40 year survive, is about the period in which you are really interested, because they are interested in their childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be taken care of:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future due to your nature, you don't have to view it today. unfortunately, there is no other way to see them as a certain formality. however, all 5-8 years should be incompatible with the current system. each other variations are in the past, the more easier is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered using the explanations in this document. use and change to open standards which are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, please keep it on and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: any time you change your computer architecture, your memory and ensuring technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert your library. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist printer for the possibility of change a system in its size. this means always enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="233">Go out of that you have planning a scalability with which you want to have a dedicated plate or partition, which you want to copy a dedicated plate or partition. * nix systems like & Linux, you can copy this area and put it on a new plate:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check the command line, whether your new plate was detected by the system, but does it not depend on.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / SDC / SDC # Source is / dev / SDC / SDC / dev / SDC / dev / SDC / dev / SDC / dev / SDC / dev / SDC / dev / SDC / dev / SDC / dev / SDC.</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day is no software more, you can read this yourself. this task is easier by year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF means a proprietary, patented format which appears slowly from the market. you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG is designed as an open source standard. it is possible to replace XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit rate of color and full transparency. PNG is needed and a slow compressive compression. this format would like to recommend you to store your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as a picture format. TIFF can be stored in a compressed form or in a container with some cameras you can store your images in this format. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital file format is a license-free and open format format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG is based on TIFF / EP format and is committed to use of metadata. a handy camera system is now available and we hope to use the competitors from Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be a reason why the file is based on XMP technology to replace the & quot; the file's metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information can be added to the extension & quot; .xmpquot; saved the XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers withdraw it in front of your image file. but it is necessary to store the metadata separately between the metadatendatei and the picture file. therefore, you should use the file format. therefore, you should use DNG as a container and place it all there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organisation that support a wide range of application and business models. the activities of the DCMI has become a wide range of architecture and workshops, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and clarifier efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or scanners. so long the pictures of the camera uses, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert video files to DNG and save them in your raw material. this function is not implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a sensitive process, you can use external programs to external programs. if you want to add the pictures again with & digitised, and then you should add the metadata. these were cut by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the revised pictures for the copyright law with a digital watermark. export them only in Webgaleries, do not use in MPEG, use & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & take. in the section I add a description on your hard disk. you can add the camera to you on your hard disk. but the camera interface offers you many advanced settings for imports of images to your Albendship bank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digitised; use the computer to display the camera on display mode and switch it on display. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it is possible to take a while at the bottom of the camera and the pictures of all photos are displayed. if this is the case, filenames and a symbol of file association settings for each file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you may need to see the camera information about any entry. you can see the features and metadata in the camera interface, you can see the characteristics of a single order and metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialogue shows file properties and the camera information to be stored internally by the camera. an icon shows that the picture is not yet downloaded on your computer. please note that in some digital cameras are not available for all information.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider Metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, Manufacturer, GPS etc. of the image. these information are the same as at the Metadata sidebar from the main window of & digious; or the image processing. note that these metadata are not available at some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer. download all photos of their camera into a single album in & digitised. download the photos from their camera will be downloaded and we recommend to check whether the pictures can be downloaded in a album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">You don't want to download all photos, you can only use the desired selection methods of & KDE; as soon as you selected the photos can download and then download the button. the button is selected as long as you selected, until you selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera is supported, this option is now available to download. this images were not yet available until now. in this case you can choose the new pictures with a star in advance window. if you choose this option, you will only be downloaded only the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you want to download the buttons for download or download it, the list of the existing albums are displayed, displayed as a normal folder where you can read the list of folders using the list of folders. select the target album from the list and press you OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press it OK, and digitised, and invites photos of the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you can delete the desired photos, you can delete them by the camera. if you want to extinguish the button. if you want to extinguish the button, you'll need to extinguish these files and delete them.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there are no possibility to delete the camera from the camera. you should check the photos already in the trashcan. if you want to remove it from the camera. if you want to delete the camera system, you should do this over the camera system, because this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras are often used as filenames for pictures are often used as filenames. this can be done to double filenames in the same album. therefore, it can be meaningful, the date and time to integrate the time in which the file is to integrate into the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors of the image and for datasp. if you use this latter option, automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options of the transfer will open three more options before the photos will be stored on the hardcover section. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the EXIF information into the IPTC fields. the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want to use an additional data format as standard format, you can use the prefix photo% Y-% -% H:% M:% S. if you use the date & time. for more customizations, you should read the help of the fills.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option filenames, you have the option to modify the filenames in small book letters. or in large letters, if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digitised; for a photo is displayed below the name, the camera will be displayed at the preview. your settings are stored and automatically used when you open the camera to the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& take delivery; it can use all information about the orientation of the camera to play a automatic rotation during the download section. not all cameras put this information. in the section bar Metadata you can read more details about the information that lets you read your camera into the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually turned, and if your camera cannot supply this information, when you want to turn off the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turntable, you use the button over and choose the Automatic rotation in the lower part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera made information about the date you can download and digitised the same time. all pictures with the same date will be loaded into the same time. all pictures with the same date will be loaded up. in the section bar Meta data you can read, which may have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually connected, and it saves the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, you need to use the button directly and select the option of data-based flush at the bottom end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer on your camera is to download the file selection dialog. select the file selection dialog & KDE; if you select the files you are uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & KDE; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the picture selection is done, it asks & digitised; it will be uploaded to the camera. select a folder dialog for the camera. select the files and press it OK to start the high load. the pictures are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is being used as a general term in this document which is indicated in length and it is displayed on a map. the determination of the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian-GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photography it can be interesting to connect an image with a precise geographically place. not everyone uses a plane to play an area via GPS data. environmental planner, military, police, architectural office and real estate, can use this ability to use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten that, when the picture was done, you can send a postcard to another & digious; if you want to specify a postcard, which can be found, or simply select these aspect documents, it's well the position results of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how to get the GPS data in the picture? first, you should know how the data is in this fields? there are at least three ways to reach this way. directly with the correct hardware, about a follow-up of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical assignment (manual) and most recently over the manual input of well-known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera to run a GPS unit. but there's a few to work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmitting the data using a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">The GPS data from one device can take place with gpsman or GPSBabel. you need to store this data in GPX format, since this is the only format that is supported by the module for geographical assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract the data from pictures and of the GPS. at the following page you can check the same below & Linux; at the following page: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the length and latitude, or any data know, you can use this script that works with the Exiftool by Phil Harvey. it uses the signs coordinates using the Exifgoogle.</seg>
<seg id="282">Additionally no European road types. here are some European sides, at least on French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">Digitised the behavior of your work processes as possible. there are many settings to take the behaviour of & digitised; in order to select the behaviour of the delivery; the mounting dialog box is divided into eight pages. you can change between these changes by using the symbols on the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select the action can be set at bedtime preview or image processing. they put the default behaviour of & digitised; thus, if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and detailed information dates. these data will be selected automatically in the corresponding IPTC data fields. also at a database synchronisation these data will be written in the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for the author: this box should have the professional code of the photographer. this case can be seen as a freelance photographer, freelance photographer or an independent, commercial photographer. because this is a further detailed description of the car box, this also must be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for information: do not use this field, if that for a news agency, such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be entered here. if the image is a bearing photo, then the group or the agency is one of the picture to be here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC promotions save the data in the respective IPTC Felder. thus, the metadata are permanently included in the image and can not only be found in the database of & digious. these metadata are also available and can be imported into & digitization.</seg>
<seg id="289">Pictures you want to save images as a embedded entry (JFIF) in JPEG pictures, which can be read out to your photos. attention: in pictures that have already included charges these images were prescribed by the delivery of & digious.</seg>
<seg id="290">The page settings includes all options for information, who appear, if the mouse-mouse is stored in the main window over a file. depending upon chosen option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digious; supports a number of different image formats and some audio formats. to indicate it, you can add the file extention of this list; and remove any file in one & digious; Albumordner, who came to take delivery of these extensions.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by using the knob on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the lightness of & digitised can be set on this page. however, some pictures have a different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. if you use an option, you should only use on fast computing. if you have one, then you can get rid of this better results.</seg>
<seg id="294">As standard, image processing has a black background behind the shown photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select this here. you can turn the tool bar, when you use image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">The image can be covered with darker and bright color in the picture. this colours can be set here. in image processing, this fitting can be connected with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma Subsampling is meant that the pictures in a higher resolution of luminance is encoded as in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia at the immediate statement.</seg>
<seg id="297">It would not reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the size of PNG and unpack. if you have a fast machine, you can put this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">Using the TIFF files you can compress the default compression algorithm for TIFF pictures. this reduces the size of the TIFF pictures. it does not affect the image quality because the default algorithm is free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the adjustment of lossless JPEG-2000 files you can select the ratio between the loss of quality loss and file size far better than the normal JPEG. however, metadata was not supported, but was not supported during the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digious, the image processing was only a picture frame for photos. currently, it was developed very quickly to use a tool to manipulation of your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default value is that all the green pixels of the CCD-sensor can react to bright light. if you use this option to make this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option features a little soft, eliminating the 2x2 pattern pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance sheet is used on the camera. otherwise, when the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not reset. standard is a fixed colour balance, which was photographed on a white card built in the sun light.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors has the effect that in four steps more details can be ignored, in four steps more details are ignored. for other cameras this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is clear, so the parts of your images can be found in white, due to the ability to view the ability to view the top of your camera. in various rosatöes, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top-lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general is not as fast as green and red. I try to reconstruct the missing green and red shares from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a matter how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you get the option to set a level. here's a value of three is a compromise, and can therefore be adapted to every image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the Luminous value to your taste. you probably need to set him somewhat higher than the standard 1. this may also be done in the image options of the & digious; image processing is too small. in order to keep the time for Demosaicing small, you should be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process, which is used by color filtered image sensor that have many cameras and have a matrix color pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or Farbrewery.</seg>
<seg id="310">I used the quality algorithm for me: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD Interpolation (variable number of graft) used for me. it creates color artefacts on the edges. bilinear is interesting, if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable performance.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the colour deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a colourless correction, as you will be carried out during the rough conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions as these again. there are also LCMS and & digitization; information like the color information from one colour space in the others are so precise as possible as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior, if a picture is open in image processing is open / color circuit module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Colour profile folder allows you to save the folders, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC / ICC, where you can save all your profiles. & take delivery; this folder is then stored during the Starts.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings the ICC-profiles have here the possibility to go & quot; standard squot; for your profiles, everything you can change the shell file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here, only your pictures have not been administered by the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be done for the camera control and model you can use. not all profiles are included in the same way. however, some craps are not corrected. this means that you do not have to carry out the color force at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to perform the colour version.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the soft-Proof profile, which you can print how your printer can print a smaller color range, so your printer can use a smaller color range, so you can use them manually or leave the algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is fairly obvious that color profile is suitable for them. unfortunately not with the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles together. this answer is of course unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension can be seen the style for the purpose: F for a natural style, L for neutrality, N for Neutral, P for Portraits and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & KDE; image Plugin interface. it is an interface that can be digitised by a number of & KDE; image quality and images. many modules support which are written to work with each program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution is installed at the KIPI modules, you would like to use a list of the available modules. select this modules appear as a new entries in the menu of the main window and beyond, you will find some also in the context menu of the pre-text menu.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short warrants for tasks that are carried out by modules, can be set up in the menu under the course of settings.</seg>
<seg id="324">Additional information (in English) via KIPI-modules can be accessed via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugin .org or in the mobile books of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the Diaschau should be easy to understand. the upper regulator, normally about 4-5 seconds well. the other stops on the metadata are the metadata, which ends at the bottom end of the pictures during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera properties show a list of all cameras supported cameras on the left hand side. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, enabled the port settings. currently, the port settings are required, USB and USB / FireWire storage storage are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom of the bottom you can set the path for USB- and Firewire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link). you need to have a USB- or FireWire mass storage camera from camera. you'll need to set the path / mnt / camera or / mnt / or you need to mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digitised; you need to connect the camera with your computer to display them into the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Probiere you come to whether & take delivery; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set Camera dell and Port manually. after you set your camera, your camera appears in the menu camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any any name for your camera. this is displayed in the menu of the main window. if you own more than a camera, you can add all of them here.</seg>

<seg id="333">You can also connect the display of the screen saver of & digious; in case of subtypes, this accelerates the start process of & digitization.</seg>
<seg id="334">Setting the setting up to new photos are looked after a new photos. take the basic period following new or deleted albums by the base. if something out of the basic chord was deleted, it asks & digious; it should be extinguished, whether it should delete them from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different colour schematic can be used in & digious; in order to adjust the main window to your taste. this settings can select the tool from the tool bar. a preview of the available design is below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in simple text files. if you are interested in a new design for & digious; you will find additional information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">You can use this image processing with some basic tools. you can use this in order to watch your photos and for correction. the image processing can be started through a click with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selecting the agreement: / editing.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available in & digitization. so, they are not part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules you can see in section image processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom edge of the feeding, the filename names, current file names, magnification factor and the current image size shows.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the upper edge and among them the tool bar for fast access to the most common functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The machining functions of image processing will change your photos. do not have the original photo, but before you use file storage or the knob from the tool bar. note that you can't use the original photo, once you have the picture stored.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should therefore be able to produce a copy of your image, before you change it. this allows you to do with file memory.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you don't have the picture back, you can use the original image for images or the button of the image processing in the tool bar. if you lose any change that you have done on the picture since the last memory.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any action of image processing can be done and restored and restored. the last action can be readily accessible by using editing, editing, and restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you are using this often, you should make the keyboard shortened, Ctrl; -z to the backward and Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z for re-open.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you choose the & LMB in the tool bar at the same time you can press a text-button, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu applications, all the actions will also be restored and restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you've got the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool bar, image more, picture runder or the entries in the menu file. if you have made changes at the current picture you will be asked if you want to back up.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can take in the photo and out into the Ctrl; mouse bike or the symbols in the tool bar or the entries in the box menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To match a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the tool bar: the magnification factor is automatically choose</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode is displayed in full screen mode. if you don't want to enter the bar codes. if you don't want to take this on the site dialog. you can view it from the & digious; main window will be retrieve. see it the section to set the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select the image file and get the default & KDE; print dialog. you can customize your picture here, before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole sets. whole images can choose from your selection. you need to select images with the standard methods, select print assistant. if you follow the assistance, you need only need your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The main window came to the right side; the main window has a side bar at the right edge, which is provided important information and promotions for the selected images. the same side is available, without the navigation system parts, also available in image processing. it will be displayed if one of the five riders are available:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple extensions on the same rider the side bar will appear and disappear again in the edge disappear.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling unit, you can add the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed to copy all special characters are stored in the EXIF- und IPTC- fields, so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data supports only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut down, and special characters are formed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling unit in other applications, you should note this limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you may use it, you can either use the button application or change simply to the next image, which then saved restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the application button, there is a button. you can read more metadata in the selected file or database. you can also write the metadata to the files. this is always done when you choose a metadata setting, always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section evaluation shows an evaluation system from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searching for a single click on the back side. in order to evaluate several pictures at the same time. in order to evaluate several images simultaneously, select this text-text menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation will be written into the IPTC field of the IPTC field. the encoding follows the diagram in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keynote shows a searchbox to filtering the keywords, the keyword and a combo box with the previously published in this & digipbox; session of the keynote.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword is dynamically adapted to the specified search password. you can choose the number of possibilities for a keyword quickly. this capability is particularly useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further relief in the input of keywords on a picture series. if you have different keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking of the appropriate checkbox in the tree. all keywords of an image will be stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures are chosen in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword, If you choose a selection with a keyword, If you want a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The side bar filter is used to modify the selection of the option on their album, - Datum-, keynote and searches. if there is also one or more keyword filter from the right side, only the cutting quantity of these two will be displayed. all created words are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also retrieve keywords in the main view. if the keyword is already exists, you can easily draw from the right side bar and put on the selection. thus, a dialog box, which you ask, whether you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. they were selected by Strg + a, and then a keyword from the right keyword is pulled to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks for whether this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place in each start of the program. you can also be connected under the settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule and created and discover that there is a or be, you can easily connect this with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which the database is sought. this may be a album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is an name or a string chain which is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can set up an extensive selection of all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to set out options, you need only use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button to use the button as follows:</seg>

<seg id="376">This article / Tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have mainly adapted to & digious; s increased implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you have a color management workflow, which allows the colours of your camera or scanned scanned colors. with color management, you can reach the colors on your monitor with your camera or scanners, and the colours are able to print on your monitor or in the web, from your digital dark-chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme is on color authority, then everyone knows that buttons would like to provide you to any point of image processing workflows. additionally, the meaning of this tutorial gives you enough background information about color administration. additionally, you will find any links with lower information, make your own account you informed the required earnings.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow is fulfilled all six below criteria, then you have to take care of color administration.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor which is calibrated on the sRGB colour space. (more information you will find below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image editions are by email or the Web, where sRGB the de-facto standard is used.</seg>
<seg id="382">If so sRGB works well and the life for all so simple, why should I use one more color gamut in order to make sure about paint jobs?</seg>
<seg id="383">An visual example of the limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colours which we can see below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the hufeasts-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger colour space, please visit Bruce Lindblooms and then click on info and then on information about RGB working spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need my monitor to install my monitor when I decided to work in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work with RGB color gamers or not you need to make your monitor with your monitor. if you work as a colour space of sRGB, then you have to use either your monitor on the sRGB standard kallizing, a matching monitors or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve the image in most cases. do not use it before you try to try a more stringent manual process.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, abnormal, automatic setups and contrast from the menu corrected the Automatic Setup will automatically try to make the best of your colors. you will need to experiment with these effects, which acts on your photo at your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize this method determines the light values about the whole image, allowing the dark-point black and the brightest point as bright as possible without its paint shear. this function is often a magic correction for pictures the dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same method: this method is the same number of pixels in the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the double image can be produced as low as possible. it's just a powerful operation, it's a very powerful operation, which causes either a miracle, or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic exact: this method is maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. they are determined by the dark and light limit shades and adjustable the red, green and blue channels to the entire histogrammarea.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and the illumination of the RGB values of an image by one of the lowest and highest values on the greatest possible area and a new jiset of all values in between. this is only visible in visible images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digitization; is a semi-automated tool to perform the white equal to a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-equal correction is slightly restricted as one colour space with 8 bits per color. if you can perform the white perimeter from the original image. if you can perform white in the shell mode, which is in 16-bit mode, you will have better opportunities for correction better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance measure and is protected by Pawel T. Jochym. it is started using the menu entry colors white and image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The window can be adjusted in size. on the left-hand side the picture is adapted to the picture and the preview of the target. if you want to see the original file, if you want to see the original box, then you can click on the window onto the window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos features a red marker. the Luminance of the pixels under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above is a histogram, as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very useful because most pixels very small Luminous values. with one button, you can decide whether one of the three colours or your sum will be displayed. the sum will be called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on the shade, saturation, and gamma. the shade Justin lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or even down dims.</seg>
<seg id="401">If you use the above controls, you should use the colour temperature Pipette instead of this button, and you can use the colour temperature for calculating the color temperature of the white colour. this species will also be set automatically the temperature and green values.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of the default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The exposure indicator increases the colors if more than a color channel of the pixels is overcharged. you will see the combined earnings in white image. this is displayed in the preview as pure indicator and does not appear on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons Save as well as charging make this. any setting of white balance can be set up and you can save this in a text file and later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The knob contains all filter values again on their standard values and the respective neutral white balance. note that also in neutral settings like your original settings. if you want to set the original image, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the coding depth of the color channel. 8-bit coding is better suitable for high-quality images. this coding is also needed for high quality images, but also stands for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialogue as the processing of raw images. it uses the modification and instruction of colour profiles. color tonic can be carried out by the window for the helligently. a detailed guidance for the use of colour profiles, you can withdraw the chapter colour management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu under colors. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always be able to do the same correction and you will always require the same correction. you can find additional information for your audio correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way of exposure to the gradation is that you find in colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digious; the Farbeffness is presenting four colour effects, a solar effect effect, a Velvia-Filter, a Neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">At times of the chemical processing, Solarmier was a effect of the picture above the light, darker areas, and the colours were inverted through the second lighting. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust both this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar control. at approx. 50% intensity the image shows what is very chemically possible. another increase is finally a negative image, so it is not possible on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is a example of the solar system effect. the original image is the (1) and the coefficient of visual intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it distinguishes itself from a saturation that it makes a stronger contrast, the colours and glare. try it easy to use it more beautiful pictures.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the name of a brand-filled color film by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia is very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts. Velvias strongly saturated colours are very saturated color, but also some photographs, especially of which are hardly any kind of landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neonlight on the contrast edges. the parameters level controls the brightness of the results and the sliding repetitions. in large pictures the filter can reach the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to view the different colour rate of your photographs with the tools in the menu. for all your alignment. as soon as you are satisfied with the results, you are using the button Ok and you are applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you want to reduce the problem with poor lighting conditions. in this case you can reduce the tool for brightness / saturation. all changes you can look at the preview. if him, the result you can see the changes using Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">The tool gradation between the complex tool gradation and the simple Leuchase / contrast / Gamma is the tool to improve exposure. even if the dialog in this tool is complicated, need for use in the field of slider slider. concrete slider is below the histogramms.</seg>
<seg id="420">The windows contains a graphite output values, a histogram, the active edge, or the selected unit. in order to modify the intensity values of the image, and in order to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright side.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation, it is the knob there and then to pay attention, how does the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, the original and the preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamically updated, based on the settings of the image. on the left-hand side the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this select box can be set if the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis is often dominated. in pictures, the linear histogram of a single column are dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic classification is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three regulators: the top for the dark shades, the middle for the bright shades and the underside notes as well as gamer values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three cololpettes can be used in the preview of the original text, in order to adjust the input, the shade, middle and bright shades are automatically enabled. in addition, there is a button for an automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Values: the check values allow you to change a selection of manual values for each area. there are also two regulating values to be used in the input rate. for example, the compression values can be used for e.g. to create a completely light picture as the background to see anything else in the background.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set automatically depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Store as and loading: with these buttons, the embedded values can be stored in the filesystem and later again. Gimp levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">When you use this mode and the three paint spray systems will be able to use automatically for all the shade, means and Sundays. if you want to use this mode and click on the preview of the original version of the histogramms for red, green, blue and the Luminous channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option for the transformers will be controlled by all colour channels to find out pixels in order to give you the combined output of all channels. here is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on the final results.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example for the alignment of the input using red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the values are unchanged. the original image is identified with (1) and correct picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left-hand side, half of the originals and the target picture is displayed. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right-hand side the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifications channel: this select box allows the channel to specify the channel to be changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this cheese, there are two symbols to switch between a linear and logaritheses. most of the linear mode is the most popular mode. for pictures with large areas of a constant colour, the linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode helps increase.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you turn right, e.g. the bright notes, e.g. the bright shades, then you can see that these bright sounds can be done with darker expression and that the associated frame pixels can be darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red waymark. if you want to change this marking the curve on the curve, which represents the original value. create a point on this line and move the spot on this line and then move the value to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and loading: with these buttons, you can make this. each curve you can store this file system and then saved it later. the file format is the Gimp spa format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you want to create this method for all channels of the shadow, medium and sun lines. keep the colour pipette which you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and Luminous curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option for the transformers will show all the color channels to show high-capacity pixels. if in more than a channel, you get the combined result. here is a indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on the final results.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo, which was corrected in the Luminous channel. shadow of sunshades and the curve was applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and this corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixers of the & digious; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or to change the color shaded of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixers is a further highly developed tool to mix the color shades of the images. you can process it from the colors channel mixer and image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">Using the channel command box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first hint as you want to view the relative distribution and view. the left-range of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed by comparison to their own riders.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target chart features a red marker. if you have a vertical line in the histogram in order to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls the right side down: control for red, green and construction allow you to keep the respective temperature of this option, because the channel mixer will enable you to produce great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, particularly if you encounter Monochrome, which is not able to occur at the same place in the color channel and their noise pattern is different in each channel. if the case you can use your Monochrome conversion in which you need to reduce the color in the color.</seg>
<seg id="447">Storing and store buttons are used exactly to this purposes. any of any mixers, you can store for later and then load. the file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option for the transformers will be controlled by all colour channels to find out pixels in order to give you the combined output of all channels. here is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on the final results.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in the blue channel. the option is enabled. the original image is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the image was shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstract certificate. with the development of digital photography is black / white, a work step, since color pictures can easily be converted on the computer. also with a set of film roller sheets.</seg>

<seg id="457">Using the & digious; tool texture, you can use decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture on your image, regardless of it is a color screen, or you can look like an oil painting, a pop art portrait of increased points or like a wall image on a wall. the menu entry can be used by image processing.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: left this parameter to the right increases the incision of the depth and three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text is applied on the picture below. the original image is on the picture below (1) and changed under (2). the parameter relief is on 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">Add a decorative frame with the & digious; the frame is made of a decorative frame in order to be added.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a viewer in the borders of a photos is not easy to keep the image. this is a psychological barrier to set the image. this is a psychological barrier to take place. under the frame, the module can be started out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you can put the desired cutaneous type for your image. with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-white images), it is also possible to add a nice three-dimensional frame for a baropfeedect and decoration, add a ornamental frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: gives the width of the frame in percent. the range of width is 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">Together with the frame, it is bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio of the aspect ratio. this is important for the pressure of images, especially when you use the tool to an aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can add simple to formatted text into a picture on any place. this goes also to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive. specify the text of the image size and set it with the mouse. you'll need to adjust the character set to the image, the bigger must be the character set. at the end, select a frame with the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting which you have chosen for your text, can be changed to the button. once the image is stored once, the text is part of the image. he cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">Using the & digious; tool templates, you can connect a template for a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu picture template in image processing can be used to convert template for a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there is no restrictions on the size and the orientation. if you want to add the need of your templates (9) if you need to add an e-mail to the & digitised file, send an e-mail to the & digitidal e-mail: mailing list digitised to @ kde.org..</seg>

<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarged the same image. in order to check the position of mouse buttons. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Reduced dimensions: this button is reduced to the surrounding image. if you want to use the mouse buttons. if you want to use the mouse click on the entire picture, you must check the picture accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Follow this button: use this button to move the picture under the template picture. take the picture and place it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to use the template on your image. the image is then adapted to the preamp size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicame; With three different tool to sharpness. each of you are different from all of you in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpen is a traditional tool to sharpness. it is very fast and easy, but it is especially in dark fields, liqueurs pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unacuity Maske works in the contrast of the edges. indeed, it's no bit to remove it, but it's a really good job. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and he is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Here is the best of the three, because he really improved the sharpness. it is a little complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapting.</seg>
<seg id="483">Pictures without focus as well as most digitised pictures need to be summarized as a common color. this is the same phenomenon occurs when colour points can be printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more subsequently sharpening as a normal cameras for the private application.</seg>
<seg id="484">At JPEG pictures, there is often a camera's internal sharpening. images in the raw format must always be drilled during the processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners with a sharpest already during the image of the image. if you need this deactivate, you get the control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get a photo taken by using a photo with the sharpening support. that allows you to make sharpening with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should give this, however, because the results increases the sharpness. however, the sharpness increases the sharpness. in general, the most needed technique is to deal with the tool. you can find more information about the menu entry. below refocus, you will find additional information and a comparison of all techniques.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes, you have the correct problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution can record a little bit as it. use the tool to the menu entry and experimenting something with the menu entry. the window on the right side of the dialogue is showing you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unrijunk is a very good tool to remove Schleier from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview can help the picture. the front panel shows the copy of the filtering with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values are often made good results, and should strengthen the effect. if you try the infiltring measles to strongly make the noise and the impression of Greenland in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels on each side are affected by the filter. high resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore be able to cut the best in its final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between original and the verwiss picture is one of the original. this is the strength of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a split from the maximum RGB value and the input difference. one can define a minimum difference between the tones of filter and therefore it is avoided by a soft switch between the astness of the toughness and therefore beauty errors were avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of unsharp filter. the original image is the (1) and the picture was used (2). unsharp cut with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digious; tool-focusing on a picture through improving the sharpness. it used the copyright holder of the copyright filters -algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to deliver a picture as a result. this is a better way to focus on how to use a technique called FIR Viennese film. a focus reaches better results than unsharp counters. you can call it out of the menu by using colors Refocused on images.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular saw have a very long tail, which leads far from the original envelope, depending on the original envelope, the FIR Vienna Inverse of the palate is influenced by the most cases even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular saw. it is the most important parameter for use of this module. most of the default value should make 1 good results. you can pay a higher value if your image should be very unsharp, but then we pay attention on Heiligencertificates.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: reflecting the correlation between 0-1 and the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. the correlation is 0.5 and the values are close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation is reduced with the toughness effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Smoky filter is possible to help artifacts. however, the filter can be reduced values of 0-1. however, the filter is very poor. if the smoky filter is very poor. a needed value is 0,03. a high value is still needed, the picture is even further forced.</seg>
<seg id="502">Palß's sharpness. this parameter is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value, you may also need to increase the correlation between the correlation and / or filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrizen's size: this value can produce good results, particularly if you select great values for the circuit-shaped ness or the Gauß '. however, the module is very slow when you select great values for this parameter. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Storing and store buttons are used exactly to this purposes. any of any real time parameters can be set up and then saved for later.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all feeder, color and intensity correction on the picture before you use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture before you change the picture. the reason for this is that plenty of operations, changes are not visible, but the however later unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">When you read pictures and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should use the module to the uncompressed picture.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, contrast, contrast, better results as sharpness. this could be caused by contrast, the unsharp maskassigns a bigger neighborhood was used as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, impossible, do not show the effect of visual acuity. even under optimum conditions it is possible that the results of the FIR Vienna can always be at least as well as the invisual acuity. the FIR Viennese filter is often more often with the machining of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison of the different filtering, shown on a small unfocused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp colour image has to be corrected. this image was made using a analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about methods to obtain sharpest in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The controller Glätte continues to produce the dissemination of the area of darkened in order to generate an overlichter Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">Paint the colour allows the adapted paint for the Pupille. if you want to adjust blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The mould of image error correction is one of the most widely developed tool to remove any desired Artefacts with unparallely speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The algorithm was developed by IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different defaults as starter points for the restoration of the restoration. the available barrier are below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings to a adjustable settings, you can use the rider speaker and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailed respect, p [0, 100]: this is a small value to be found on the picture. a value of 0.9 should be more detailed and details. a value of 0.9 should be needed, so no sharpness is needed. please note the details of the details and if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="520">Prestresses on the Alpha [0,100]: a small value, even in one direction there. if you have a film length or CCD-ins, a high value of the similar pattern is used. JPEG artifacts are being used on top of a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothed [0, 500]: this sets the maximum load factor above allosp. then the relative gain is defined. put this value to the degrees of the room in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. this is necessary if it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turbullets you need to be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: are often run on how often of algorithm is usually 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle tipping da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropen Alpha. if alpha is chosen, you should choose that small angle will generate a long term running. you should choose this value so the maximum possible and choose for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integral stride length in pixel. you should put the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel delay and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: thanks to the quality you get to the option of this option is low, but the running time. we recommend it to allow him to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as well as charging make this. any setting of image errors can be saved and saved in a text file.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it may last very long and take a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation using the knob.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image error with small artefacts are applied. the module is used on a photo, used in Guatemala City. as you see there is a bad film position during the journey. the original image is shown below (1) and corrected the image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digious; noise is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses an ancient protected algorithm of Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool is provided with selectable image filter to remove stains and different artefacts that can be removed from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor from the camera or moreals; effects of injectors from books and magazines can be removed too.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor rauters from digital cameras, you can read this on English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The photo of the photo above shows a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a liqueurs that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you will only need the lower window and the flush advanced settings can stay in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius will take the filter size, 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is needed for filter. the image is necessary for the filter. by the radius, the image specified by the radius and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller errors.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpest distance. this value increases the edges of the filter. if it is increased, the edges must change the edges. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image data can't get more and smoothing or lubricating it again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response to the noise. if it's not able to reach the noise, if you want to remove it on a value near to the maximum, if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="538">Light density: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or light density to improve the image. this settings does not affect the gain process that will be controlled by details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the colour tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or light density to improve the image. this settings does not affect the gain process that will be controlled by details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance limits of the darker areas, which typically have a stronger increase. however, the shadow areas are lubricated.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the alignment system radius on variations of the luminance. if it is increased when it is too high, the edges can occur at its minimum, noise and phase shift on the edges. it can remove the noise, and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and store: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for the smoke-cries which you have set, can be stored in the filesystem and later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how smoked your life could change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and correct with (2). the room has been applied with standard settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes it is a painting for your purpose. the solution that allows the picture to draw a little bit as a picture. use the menu entry to the menu entry and experimenting with the Glätte. the window on the right side of the dialogue is indicating the effect of this operation.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digious; photo restoration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools in photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter allows you to remove the possibility of undesirable Artefacts of your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauls, original or subsequently digitised images in digital, original or subsequently digitised images. the smoothness is done along the images and receives the contents as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and textured using any other tool. the algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannkrich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even far away. as an lossless compression algorithm he produces some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards in uncompressed picture. this setting is to correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as well as charging make this. any setting of photo restoration, this is stored in a text file and later will be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restorration is relatively very fast at work. however, it may last very long and take a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation in any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can see how a photo is applied to a black and white photo. the module is applied to a black and white photo with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film transverse to the faces. the original image is below (1) and corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below, you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time Textures was applied to an old color photo, which was used by the scan lighting and the photo paper. the original image is shown below (1) and corrected the image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digious; Tools Hotpixel has been allowed to remove it pixels of photos which were removed with a CCD camera, eight were removed from the JPEGpixel project, which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are particularly in high-quality raw mode pictures, because many cameras come with JPEG compression via a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; and "quot; bright pixelquot; on a photograph with a dark-to-extraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file in the assistants with the knob. the tool is recognizable from the hot and light pixels. these are shown in the exhibition show.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you can discover the dark-screen directly in the connection to create new hot or bright pixels because of CCD Defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should find the appropriate component of the dark. a automatic processing of dark cheap will be found. please note that the assistant to the last dark and this automatically recharges in the next meeting.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview can help you within the image. the window shows the output of the filtering with the current settings. poor pixels is available in all pre-areas areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and results of the filtering. select the best filter method to interpolishing these pixels blocks. these are the available filter available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Durcut: there is an average of the neighbour pixels. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels which have a distance of 1 from pixel block, to calculate a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpoled the defective pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to a pixel block is drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolishing the pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less, are produced to calculate a bi-Cuban surface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1-dim) and then used to interpoled the defective pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image was increased to 300% (1) and the correct picture is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digious; Vignetatic correction is a tool to correct the Vignet, i.e., at a image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially in the medium and large display sizes, can often burn the edges and edges of the image, by making the light that the sensor can reach the sensor there. teleobjectively can also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he also has disadvantages. many centre filter require a factor of 1.5 or 2 with a flash filter, which is impossible to keep the camera by hand. wide angle objective is to use center with center filter, a opening of f / 16 or smaller, because otherwise impeeling effects arise.</seg>
<seg id="569">With great exposure ranges of today's film and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a stock of digital cameras, this is possible to simulate the transformation with a Centerfilter. the tool is protected by John Walker. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">Using three shelves, you can control the Vignetatic correction filter and with three additional exposure to the target.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light-level loss. the standard density is 2.0, which is randomly compensated with a flash point of 2, or randomly compensating the density by a larger degree of viability, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchase, contrast and gamma settings: the image of an image with the Vignetatic correction reduces the level of image with this options. you need to adjust the options to adjust only positive values, as you need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want to adjust the fineness of the target, you can set the values for illumination / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation of the & digious; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetspirits correction on a picture. the original image (1) shows the correct picture in the edges and (2) corrected the image. a leukemia and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digious; Linsensus, is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses in photos. it uses an ancient protected algorithm of David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometrical distortions. colorings can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second gradient is treated with the general geometric acid and can correct the conave of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third Grades has a similar circular effect, flax but on the edges. this correction is not supported in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth Grades corrected the remote corners of the remote corners. if you combine these two combine, any geometric distortion can be eliminated almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value will be corrected the strength of the grafts from the second Grades. with negative values can be corrected and reduced the positive values to be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion. this value is stronger than in the centre of the image. for most lenses, the 'corners parameter set the parameter from the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value is reiterated the image size and thus leads a correction of the first grading by. negative values improve during positive the image.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighter: this value increases the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values reduced the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values are increased.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you to find the best filter settings, illustrated the dialogue with a preview the locking correction. values for your image are stored and stored in the next start as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The clay / kcience correction should be carried out in front of all feed or size changes. if you have a picture, cut a picture, and then a tonight correction would be the effect of the Falsche.</seg>
<seg id="586">To give you the best correction, this tool will show you a vertical and a horizontal support line. move the mouse button to fix the lines at this place. in the connection, you can correct the tone - / kcience of distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you have a kcience of distortion, the resulting image black corners will have. you can remove this with the cutting-cutting machine in the menu, remove the image processing or remove the zoom controller in this dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most photos are the tonight-shaped correction. the next logical step for some motifs, e.g. photos from the front, frame and paintings, it is the perspective so that if you have the camera by hand, you will always keep the camera by hand.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonight-shaped correction for a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on an simulating infrared film of the Gimpguru.org website under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfra film, see this URL. this film has a range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">On the left side of the window, you can select the area for the preview. if you see the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can simulate two parameters of film trays and film sensitivity. the ISO regulator changed the amount of film vision and the Dominicity of the colour green (chlorophyll in nature). green meadows is white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Because the filter colour channels were interred to produce infra film, especially the green channel to apply the effect on black / white photos, because the colour can be missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filming is applied to a landscape photo of New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the image was shown below (2). the sensitivity of the movie was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of Aura in the top.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digious; filter screening test is an easy-to-use tool for creating film trays like the B / W Kodak Tri-X. in order to increase the sensitivity of the films by the manufacturers, the manufacturers and the photographision of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film transverse effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. if you want this special, gallery-like, street-photographic, grading view, looking for your monochromen photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can calibrated according to the control of intensity and granularity of Körner calibrated. the default value is even higher values are set to ISO-2400. if you need more baskets, you can use the filter times several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film transformations on a black / white picture. the original image is the (1) and the image (2) used. the used film sensitivity is ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The oil used oil is created; filter oil paintings created the appearance of an oil painting. it uses an urable legal algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digious; filter oil paintings gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There exist two control to influence this effect. the upper select the pinselsize is between one and five. thicker brushes are better for large pictures. smoothes the throttle or, from the other side, the hints.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and this is marked with the (2). pinselsize for this 640 pixel image is 1 and Glätte 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digious; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity. therefore, the lines that stem from slowly. however, pictures of their grafts are not ideal for this effect. it's helpful how to imagine what the scene you would have chosen. this would be good pictures to start any way.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two regulators with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controller chooses the bottom size and lower the contrast (Glätte).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal combustion filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved by adapting to the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digious; filter engraver sets out your image in 3-D as if it was used in wax. it uses a full copyright algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digious; filter engraver is a quick tool to give your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where color does not use the most important content. the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to turn the image into a gray, mondaring landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the image (2) used. the depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">Using this filter group you can transform a normal photo taken into a work of artwork by disarming effects. it uses copyright law of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Shaft blocks 1: how the image in cells have a and let us look, as if it is viewed by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analog to the shaft blocks 1 becomes the picture here with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can break this effects at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="614">Using this filter group you can transform a normal photo in an art work by means of invisual effects. it uses copyright law of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom 'acuity: verwiss the picture along with a focus, which simulate evidence of a zooming camera, thereby simulates a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often in the sporting photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radicals: verwiss the image through rotation of the pixels in order to be a focus. this simulates accident prevention of rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distances of distances: verwiss the image about the effect of a not focus on camera. the object seems to occur in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Visual acuity: uncertain the picture by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates damage and visual acuity of linear, z: B: from one car or train photographs, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Very visual acuity: the image soft in the dark and strong in the light tones. this creates photos with a dream and smooth focus (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portrait, glamour photos or to add a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schüttelinacuity: therefore, the picture caused by accidental shift of the pixels and simulated the impregnation of a consistent camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Unacuity: the color basin in the picture and knowleak up to change it without the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: the photo in rectangular cells and created it, by adding an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore break this calculation using the knob.</seg>
<seg id="624">The shelves are a nice small tool to make shelves on your picture. this gives natural your pictures a native appearance. it is used by Pieter Voloshyn-copyright algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Tropical size allows the size of the drops to change the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number of changes and the density of the drops. fish changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can stick with the & digitidy. use the option to choose from the area, e.g. a face, which will be free to choose from. if you start the filter Regentropes, the area will remain open from Regentropes.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the shelves Filters. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the image (2) indicates an sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the picture is the wrong orientation, so you can bring it by mirrors or turning into the right orientation. the tools you can find in the menu Transforming Dreams and transforming.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo pen is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo to enlarge with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to handle is easy. the great question is, how can you find a picture on the image? how can you find the lack of information can be found or roasted? the Cimg algorithm is used here, makes here a good work. try and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a picture size, you can change it to the desired size with the size of the tool. select the transforming size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog box is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool used to change a linear interpolation method to view the pixels. if you want a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to put the tool.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing is using a type of interpolation, for example Splitting interpolation for the image. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to change the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the new size in the new size:</seg>
<seg id="635">Aspect ratio: if this adjustment is activated, if the setting is activated, it will retain the aspect ratio of the original size of the original size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. this is necessary if it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turbullets you need to be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons Save as well as charging will be used exactly. any explanation for picture can be saved as text file and later will be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">It is very fast with what it makes it, but it can still take a very long time and take a high CPU load. you can break the calculation in any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below for a picture below, by a small color picture to double the size. the original image (1) and the increased image (3) is increased. the image (2) is the result of the linear standard increased compared to comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photos is not only a common operation, but also a often understandable tool to create a picture. in order to create a picture with mouse, click the mouse button, by pressing the mouse button, and draw your rectangle. you will see this rectangle when you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you want to cut the mouse button, the area will cut off the road. thus, you can change the size of the rectangle, by clicking the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle create it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the recording, use the button image processing of image processing in the tool bar and the photo will be tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file to store or file storage below in the menu file to save the newly built photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the lecture area you can change the size of the rectangle by clicking the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio which you will be defined in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="644">With the aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as a high-format or cross-format. in the high-format, the larger value of the height and the size of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool can cut a relative aspect ratio of the aspect ratio, regardless of whether you can use centimeters, inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and its aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue there exist two buttons for the selection of automatically horizontal or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below, you can use the Max. ratio button to cut the maximum possible, depending on the selected ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool can be used by the aspect ratio (horizontal or vertical). if you are displayed, this settings are displayed as standard values in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data will be reflected on the cut picture and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the work must help you to make your images better, so that help you want to make your images better.</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic parts are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-party, harmonic triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in harmonic triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden Mitte: the Golden Mitte is a split which is on different natural growth, like the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the blender of a sunflower. it is mentioned in all possible things that we find as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The Golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by the old Egyptians and architects. artists and architects have used the Golden division in all times when you create your images, buildings and even photos gathered to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number leads from the fibonacci 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 and etc; from where every number is 1: 1,618 the golden centre. a composition which is usually defined as visual harmonically.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden Mitte is liquid auxiliary lines provided for you when you put a picture. this is shown below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will be able to achieve good results for your photos. compared to third party, the golden spiral has a liquid line of the eye. this type of composition leads along the line of the spiral and makes a symmetrical visual river.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule will be used to create the golden spiral, the golden spiral. it should be something that the eye should be the center of the composition. that can be just a line or different objects. this is just a little bit just because his eye will be able to use its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Tribes are also reflected from the above-mentioned golden spiral. please note that, in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles do not include a twisty triangles. diagonal amounts to these lines can be found.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles using the work of professional photographer dynamic Symmetrie. try out your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can not reach different.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options for the horizontal and vertical mirrors can be used to mirror the harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the relief lines. if you set a picture with many colors and a high contrast, you can customize the set-lines. on this way, you can customize the color of the lines your latest picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free press is a tool to turn an image to turn any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it happens to keep the camera not exactly vertically and horizontally. this creates a picture in which the camera is made by an angle. image processing and tool-free web press. select the transforming free web press and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with sliding angle. the values on this slipcase is specified in degrees. with the knob there you can set the slider again to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image is displayed on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="664">To your help the module free a horizontal and vertical line available. move the mouse pointer in the image preview. after making it an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have a picture-shot, you are able to find a triangular holes in the corners. possibility of repair it is the function of transforming cutting out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is the function Automatic. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option is smoothing the picture a bit after turning. please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All Peruvian transformations are carried out by a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">In order to change the perspective, you have to view the red quadrate at the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically calculated automatically. on the right side of the dialogue you will find some information about what you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas, the empty area produced by the transformation.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: showing the height of the new image, including empty areas, the empty area produced by the transformation.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left down: shows the current angle in degrees on the bottom left corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right: shows the current angle in degrees on the bottom right corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After the adaptation of the perspective, the image is a little bit. for a single adaptation, this effect is small, but two adaptations provide a double or strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you get the perspective, you have an amazed triangular holes of the corners. one possibility to bered this, it is possible to cut the picture with transforming cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The switching tool is used to move a part of the image to the left and the lower part of the image. this is not a turning, the image is torn. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transforming.</seg>
<seg id="679">Make your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can set horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you set by default, the angle is displayed and the new dimensions of the target will be displayed and displayed the new dimensions of the target range.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help you get a vertical and a horizontal line. move the mouse to an important point like the lake, a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the switch tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have completed the switch, the image is a bit verwiss. for a single loop is the effect is negligible, but two shellations of generating twice as much buischation and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After closing the picture is unnice and triangular holes in the corners. one possibility to remove this image with transforming cutting out of the image processing.</seg>

<seg id="732">The main window is open to the opening ceremony. at the beginning of this case, the main window is empty as in the lower screen photo. in this case, the tool bar can open only the symbol file and the (blank) list includes the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">Once you have one or more & dot; files selected, the main window will see the main window as in the lower screen photo:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview in the corner is indicated when the Graph is larger than the string area. you can select a fixed position in this overview or select this position.</seg>
<seg id="735">The mouse wheel are used (high and rallied with no special buttons, left and right at pressed & Alt; button);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming can be limited in both directions by a factor of 10. below you see the maximum load of a graphite.</seg>

<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for invalid Graphs. it is used according to the sprint model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used to achieve the same as a statistical scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a jump spring model layout. it uses the Fruehman-Reingold Heuristics, and includes a multi-hover triggers for the treatment of large and gevity.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm ordnet the knots in accordance with the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and meadow, 2002. he is useful for certain diagrams of multi-cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">This dialog will open a dialog box, which will be carried out by a shell. the command should give the graphs to stdout in the xdot format. with such a lay-command, you can specify the & graphs; algorithms special options, or change the graphs with a filter change before it is drawn.</seg>

<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dranw by Dave Coffs. an original file of Him: expect the same results to get the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. at least you get better results!</seg>
<seg id="855">Select the RAW file to be converted to and start the module. the Raw image converter will then be released in mode for a single picture. you can view the effect of your current settings to the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimise the conversion process. the key parameters can be used for the white. the key parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is optimally enabled, you can see the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to use the contrast information. if your camera has no effect in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats, and the converges are still adapted, and the extension will be adapted according to the extension. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and used the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you're looking forward to edit your images often or later, you should not use the JPEG format, because it allows only a limited number of operations before the image quality has worsened. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata are stored in the RAW file, which are stored in the EXIF information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings to start your settings. if you want to break the conversion. if you want to break this process, you can use this process.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacking mode allows you to convert various images at once. do not use this mode, e.g. by testing at a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images. however, if this is helpful if this is needed in an earlier trial. however, a preview is not available. the progress of the bar shows like far the conversion is advanced.</seg>

<seg id="922">In this area you can point to look like the HTML pages. most of the options are clear, which is why not especially received.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below, you can choose various resolutions for the pictures. this allows you to consider for your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no pictures have to download a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer can change your site at any time. you can change your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time, as well. if he would like to get a picture bigger, he would like to get a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this adjustment range you want to store the various folders and the URL that your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Select the best set for all your HTML files a basic ordner and for every subsequent set of a new subordner.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you have to select the main character in which all your images are stored. this folder is stored and automatically by the next time. this folder can select either a folder or a KDE supporting protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check whether this is a web browser, after the pages were created. the URL that would be set here. otherwise, the URL should be set here. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If you do not have to copy it manually in the final finish line, see, right, you will need to specify the final target of the files. this is not the subordner of the current files, but the basic ordner in which all subordner can be found.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described features are included all three on basic ordner and URLs. in this purpose, a subordner is created, whose name is listed in output file.</seg>

<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kin files, internal and external. they differ in the file, it is possible to save all pictures in the file. the advantage of all pictures can be seen in the file that you can see all the pictures, and this file is so independent, however, the file size is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can use a .kin file either directly from the menu file, exporting... or together with HTML pages, see if you create a .kin file together with a HTML file, it will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file is looking for a double-time file. first, the pictures of the URL that are indicated in file the file. if you are searching for HTML files, this is of course only possible if you have your .kin file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following is described in the dialog for exporting images described by the menu file, exporting the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialogue is, whether it should work on internal or external .kim files, there are the following three selection options available:</seg>
<seg id="938">In the file manually near to the .kim file, you will need to copy the pictures in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatic program in the vicinity of the .kim file copy & fotable album; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kin -files are normal Zip files. as most pictures have been compressed with JPEG, and the XML file doesn't matter if you want to compress it. if you want to compress this, simply select the option Export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum image size. if you want to send your friends in full size, because the .kin file would otherwise very large. here you can see the size limits by using any image of up to 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with Entry .kim from the web browser or from the menu file impedance... select & kphotoalbum; the exported database is copied as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to the impedance is of four steps. first, you need to select what pictures you want to import them, in which file the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is possible that you can choose the category of persons who is different from the database (if you have a Danish), while this category is in the third dialogue, which will be imported to the categories of the file, and which categories these categories are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can see the categories in inflows with the categories of your present database. one example of this one can see on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be simply to browse pictures and view: if you see pictures, you would like to watch photos within different picture groups and mdash; if you want to see photos of your Italy holiday and enjoy a picture with your friend, you may find perhaps all pictures, on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will find the different steps from (1) fixed the information about your pictures, via (2), search and renown, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was begun as a program for managing your pictures. it has been expanded and now also cares your videos. in many places in this manual, it is spoken by pictures, but often there is also videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& illustrated album, stores all of its information in the file indexed .xml in the top folder of their images. this is a simple XML file, you can copy with a program of your choice, e.g. Normale backup tools, copy a Disk- or revisions in CVS, you can save them.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum, read the folder where your images are stored and uses a other database tree with images, you can start & delicious album; using the -c option. for example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / images / indexed .xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Using the menu entry settings; read more about the menu entry, you can read the settings of & kphotoalbum; change the settings of the user interface; in the following section of the user book, you will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you see six different symbols, with which you can call the preview and options for the viewer. for every setting, you can call a button on the F1 button and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">In this context, as you can set up for each picture, for example persons, places, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as items, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">In view of the dialog box, which is used to process pre-existing groups. for each existing group you can choose a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section, there were already mentioned categories as mentioned in the dialog. in the dialog box, you can set all members of a group on once in a group rather than any group of groups as in a group.</seg>
<seg id="956">You can see the adjustment possibilities which are available to guests. with the uploading list, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left-hand side is a list with the current category and in the right-hand part of the subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">The module system is based on other graphic applications, such as digitiam and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & KDE; Image Plugin interface. nails can be found on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called upon the menu modules, which are not described in this manual, because they are not part of & chable album; however, the modules have to be sold separately. however, most modules have a help, which you can call over the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules of multiple applications can be used together with the demo database, you can use this module with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu process. don't know, I would not be warned!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that are using the modules via KIPI, are very different, making it possible that some modules are with & chable album; not work. this is the drawback if you have a variety of applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The largest difference between & chable album; and other applications that do not use their images in albums by other applications: this type of order is not supported, simulated it for some modules the order to albums, so that you can use the features with & kphotoalbum;</seg>
<seg id="962">This will simulates & cold album, the current album, which is simply the current album, thus all pictures that show you the picture of this review.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album & kphotoalbum, the modules also must have a list of albums by albums. here's & illustrated album, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum, in the browser the contents of a category shows, for example, all persons, then each entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it is the category that you have set the category dialog for virtual albums by category. for example, if you use the category 4, it will be able to be & illustrated album; so if you selected people to view and enter the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum; not compatible, you can remove this from the list of modules. start the installation dialog and select the modules that modules are loaded to modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you see an example for a start screen, once you start & delicious album; with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you can see it from any other KDE application, you can see the window with which you can read more about your pictures. in the section we will check on this window, but now click on the entry pictures, which shows you an overview of all the pictures show.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum, is the possibility to see each image by comments on the picture, etc. you can set up each image either separately or for a larger number of images. if, for example, in all pictures of Jesse, and all pictures were included in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browser as you can read in the section. if you want to see this comments if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists with a text field by offering people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; because you can always use it again, if you set information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is the move within the list: if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures of the same 5-10 persons, you can find that the name must be moved up after above, which can be found faster and easily.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to select a alphabet list, click on the icon for sorting to date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have been selected for each image, you may still want to edit all the selected images and these pictures are made. click in this case simply to the picture above and back-up, which are under the preview of the picture above.</seg>
<seg id="975">For example, if you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, you can find it more convenient to mark these images and to use the menu entries to one note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you'll see a browser window onto the USA as an overgroup. to show that, a special icon is displayed.</seg>

<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the remarks dialogs by adding the corest, which form the top edge of the frame, and move through a separate window by adding it out of the window.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you're looking for the appearance of the window as to your needs, please click on the button, click on the button options... that gives you the possibility to store the current construction and appearance of the window.</seg>

<seg id="1042">If a picture comes with only one beam, these images can arise different error. these images often have a moirè-pattern or step-effects in curves and lines, sometimes details are not indicated when they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called Aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technology called anti-aliasing, to decrease the influence of this bug. generally, images are better from this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you switch anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technology is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-relocking method. the second method is adaptive, because every pixel is always understandable and adapted because every pixel is dependent on the calculated color range.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, using POV-Ray, if you set the threshold levels of pixels with super-sampling. if you select the advantage of a certain amount of pixels with super-sampling. if you select the value of 4x4 extra points, if you receive an extra size of 5 to 5x5 (25) additional beams.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixels. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1-b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The remodelled method starts with 4 wires each pixels. if the difference between the color values exceed the threshold, then the pixels is divided into 4 subpixels, which can be tested individually and can be tested on further information. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another possibility of aliasing effect is to reduce the generation of Rauschen's trial, called Jittering. if you switch to Jating, changes & Povray; the rays is to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular pattern.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of Renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflon. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this box map, you can adjust the alpha channels by POV-Ray. one pixel is then transparent when the associated rays must have no object.</seg>

<seg id="1077">You've just got & Povray; and & kpovmodelers; installed and now you want to follow the knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should consider the ultimate but simple scene to create very popular: one ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should have the following warnings, so before you have about that you can only receive a black screen. if you use a 3D program for you, you should note this important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't want to adjust the camera to be applied, as a result, you will receive a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't add a light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you will only receive a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have anything without any errors, you see at first start of & kpovmodelers; the following pre-set window changes:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to learn the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar. read the documentation, so you can get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will have to use these menus and symbols, therefore, you should find the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler: starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you need to remove all objects from the object tree. mark the scene, then select the menu entry, and then you have a scene without objects without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wireless model view shows the whole scene, which you create. in particular, you will notice that in the fourth wire-view (right bottom). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this is showing the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree has now includes a new entry with the designation Camera. if you click on the contents of object properties, in which the different parameters of the camera can be found in the user documentation & Povray; you will find additional details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing to the basic settings of the camera, which is later to change it, but you can change the camera in view of the camera, using the left mouse button on a control point and draw it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button application or the input button, the wireless model views and the object is immediately following this settings. as a result, they see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. it might be set for example a quader (insert) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a reversible method applied to this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; in fact, offers an easier way to use. you can use the infinite plain as a ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plain in the object tree, change the name and press the knob button. in object tree the new name is immediately displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wireless model view is now also the level, even at the moment only as a limited level. when you render the scene, the level up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you can check the object tree, if you click on the symbol no. in this case you can see the various parameters of the object. in this case you can only find the default options for each new object: scaling, turning and shift. select one of this options, also the possible settings in view of object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, so that you get to learn some of these parameters. select the shift and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Choose the floor from to set up its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose the moment a little bit of the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialogue in which you can select, as the object will then be displayed in object tree. you can view the name in the property view (name = floor-Pigment), with one click on the button, you looks like the pigments.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of pigments are only need to enter the pigments. remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with one click on preview. enter the colors for the pigments. also, there are many ways to check the colours now.</seg>
<seg id="1098">When you don't see in the preview no color on Quader and ball, click only on the button application and call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now properly set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the symbol, you should receive the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, the color does not need to enter the color. choose two new attributes needed. select this entry you have to do this entry twice (you may also do more frequently, but the chess board-color list can only be used only with two colours):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Choose the object tree in the object of any object and change the colors in view of object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step you should already run just as you can use the fundamental work of & kpovmodeler; the ball should be just as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of object properties you can change the settings for the radius: 1 (don't forget to pressing the input button or the button on the floor. otherwise, the sphere has the ground up to the bottom, because you have moved the ground to bottom one unit.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, Renders is now a strange result: as already in advance, the ball surface appears as a mat black material. set the following step in the following step.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now show a material. like on the ground, you enter the ball a pigments as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select the best accommodation and change the name for example in ball Pigment. click on ball pigments, select the color and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can get more interesting effects if you arrive at the time, some finish properties allow to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Change the values like in the following screens and click on the application or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings are also shine and reflection on partially good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromium surfaces, even if metal: even not selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have an excellent impression of what offers you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you've already learned about many, but you can create simple, but nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a method applied to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional image or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you have a scene raytracing, which is reflected from the perspective of the observer, such as these straightened by objects, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and as an atmospheric effects, such as fog, the scene is processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine how to watch the camera, you can view the camera. without a light source, you will also see nothing, the image is just black. obviously, each scene is obviously, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>

<seg id="1483">& k3b; as many other & KDE; applications can also be equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled over a shellery.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions you can use the command line dcop, or a bit more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the functional scope, therefore it is rather a taste and the kind of your task is crucial to give you the programs.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use the command line program dcop. to make sure the & DCOP should make sure you must ensure that & k3b is started; then enter just like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that all & KDE have already supported, assisted & k3b; mainly two other parts, which are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; features such as copyCD, format DVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createaudio CDProject () DCOPRef createaudio CDProject () DCOPRef "() void" Dvd () void burnCdImage (KURL url) void burnCdImage (KURL url) void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you can produce a project about the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project by # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject. use of this reference is possible to change the project about K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above listed K3bProjectInterface, and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can be used only on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name, Qstring Parent) void single Url (KURL:: List URLs, Qstring Parent) void DehameItem (Qstring), Qstring newname) void setyneID (Qstring Quartet)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script will add a data project, several folders and add files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder / foo dcop $PROJECT addateFolder / foo dcop $PROJECT addateFolder / home / home / home / trusive / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>

<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; the user interface of cdparanoia (compressed compression) is supported by MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression). further coding can be added to the program (if they have installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the title of & CD will be read and compressed into WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, this WAV files will be compressed into the MP3 or OGG format or other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD; it is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost any distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if that is not installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, we have to be installed for any Linux distribution (for MP3), but it is not necessary to compile it. but it's not only need to compile it. if, for example, FLAC is not used, the installation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1500">What cooperated / file format should be used? see chapter Welcher Kodierer is a small introduction of Kodierer, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to the copying of free audio CD; it's not possible to remove any audio CD; the program is not possible to avoid any audio CD; in any case you can avoid & kaudiocreator; not the mechanisms of the copying protection may be missed. avoid the purchase of copy-protected audio CD; it is not possible to avoid the copy of copy audio CD;</seg>
<seg id="1502">While set only once you have to be found (the setup dialog will be found), the daily transfer of a & CD can be explained on the hard disk. this leads to the understanding for the slender approach of the user interface, which you are proud to check at the beginning of the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="1506">The CDDB request the CD data will be using the CD-Data according to the CD-CDDB. (this may be locally or online, in the latter case you need to be connected to the Internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">The reading and - if a Encoder will be configured in the register parameter settings in the setup catalog - the coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of the available encoder, so that the selection can be read with a different encoder than the standard. it is to be observed that before the Encoder has been configured in the tab dialog for mounting settings.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, allowing an already used file to encode the file, instead of a full & CD; the file manager will be encoded and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Open the installation dialog for the kind of alerts (such as protocols, piepsen) for programming languages (as read the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main landmark dialog for & kaudiocreator; with different map cards (such as Encoder, for encoders of encoders), before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coding and compression rates and helps you to choose the right encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If any audio data are lost, it is necessary to do any audio format. apart from FLAC, there are other like 'shorts' or 'Monkey' which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the small compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can use these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">In addition to audio formats, you lose MP3 and OGG the most common. OGG mag now have a light advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above these bitrate will provide differences, because both codiers are very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame will still be included with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared with OGG slightly deeper than deeper bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - If only music is to be heard from a computer or machine-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG devices are present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB Stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo devices. today - early 2009 - these devices are usually only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium' = This setting is good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = This setting should usually offer for most persons and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for stereo audio systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 - 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3 kbps. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less to less complex pieces of the unit. good enough for stereo audio systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. don't need 256 kbps to complex and less complex pieces of a titer. some older devices require CBR. good enough for hi-fi equipment with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR, common stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all plays an Title. good genug for music of teenagers, portable devices and Autostereoons. but not good enough for better stereo set audio systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane' = 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most persons and most environments, but if you're absolutely the highest quality, you want to view the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD can be picked up, or through the program automatically from freedb to the internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can put / needed / needed with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create folders and file name as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with cooperating programs, there are often a combination of program settings for the Kodierer and these parameters here. the manual or help to the Coalition explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, if MP3s are encoded with lame (English: day) if MP3s must be encoded with lame, the switch board of lame and the title parameter from & kaudiocreator will be added. the result sees that: '... Read More...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters which can be used (= button name in the assistance):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the free database can read the audio CDs, so that all other information can be downloaded from the computer. it is to be observed that only by text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal anymore. however, no one can prevent the information on the & CD; and the information can be added on the & CD; therefore, any information can be added to the music company. all the information can be added to a & CD by a & CD; business, physically, or virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; an address is used as being used in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems that the e-mail address is not used on the retrieve of the server (this is not only the programmer know that the code is checked.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of major database copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator; for use of freedb, geographically, the geographically set is to be used on the next profile server. this saves bandwidth between the network and the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror-demand for online demand from & CD; for information about a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually a monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What the readed program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">It is obvious that cdparanoia is used; who want to be more accurate to check out the source code.... It's already the best choice for audio CD; and to note that the cdparanoia package must be installed at the appropriate distribution if this is not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To store WAV files, the coding and the desired file format can be chosen. during the first opening, the entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) can be added to the coding. other coding can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The coding package must be installed from the Linux distribution before the coding can be used before the coding is required. for more information about Kodierer are in Chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a coachers, more information about his switch can be obtained via the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a tapered window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the names of the installed coachers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can be used by the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and readers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, FLAC & etc;), try to retrieve both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could be an indication of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; read the cover of the & CD; check the hull of the & CD; this will not be gelingen!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this tips may give tips as you go.</seg>
<seg id="1543">You may read the complete manual, but it's still uncertain to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will make enough information that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, and we read the program for the first time. we are able to create MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3v1 keydically (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It should be cdparanoia and lame to be installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packet for your Linux distribution. anyway, it is not necessary to compile your source files. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, what you can do of course.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you own write permission (eg; by using the queror to copy it with the paqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with basic entries of & kaudiocreator; something which is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second part describes the procedure for reading a & CD; which has to be repeated for each of the selected & CD; repeat them.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 - 256 kbps) and the resulting audio quality are used. since we are faul, we share a program that allows you to use & CD to download the & CD; data from the internet down.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Even though we are able to change these settings at any time, we will likely not be able to change any & CD; if once the right settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name will be handed over to the check-in program that can read & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / CDROM is a symbolic link to the real device name. if this is not working or more than one & CD / DVD drive, it can also be connected to the file / etc / frod and an attempt to connect with the existing entries for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The General Terms of General Settings. here is not much to do. here you can choose any additional transformation. in our example, everything will be displayed as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only At incomplete information, you choose that you will be informed if data are missing in the words of keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The box map CD; settings. simply select both entries. we can comfortably and let the & CD; data automatically via the Internet from a freedb interface.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected during the reading & CD; with the internet, it can be connected to the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is simple, a & CD will be able to read it with a low-risk file, and the file name may be easily changed. the directory or file name will be changed with Konqueror- &gt; Add-up and the ID3 tags of Kid3, the & KDE; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, if you want to use this database, if you want to use the database before. however, this is worth up to 620 MB / s. if you want to use this is worthwhile in the offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set on the map map.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freedb. this is necessary for the data on request for retrieve the & CD through the Internet. how knows how to get the system you will get the CD on freedb? read the section about freedb. do anything else as it is shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we want to work with the remote database on the Internet Server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB Server: please go on the site of freedb.org and look for a mirror server in your vicinity. this track will operate as first attempt on this road. however, this setting will work as first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work does not work on the server, but many firewalls of the protocol 8880 standard, is perhaps more fortunate with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to transfer & CD; data on the freedb servers should be enough.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings of the screen photo. (make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of signalled pieces: no debt, there is a reason why one reason why is more than one time? parallel with only one existing drive? parallel to reading and coding? the author knows it not just trying to yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading of the last piece: check this to the & CD; at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you want to cross the file / folders may be useful if only space on one other drive is available. if you don't want to check the files in the private file, if you don't forget this folder when you want to make them something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All this type, as it is on the screen photo. the command is something long, under circumstances must be smoothed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned before, it's a bit rate for high-speed stereo modes. the compression factor is 6.3 mm. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage power consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry of '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of tags on version V1 / V1.1 'ID3v2 can be found on demand. if necessary, internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest such as in screen photo. some Comments for future use outside these examples:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously accessible WAV files: for a Dualcore or Quad-core or even one multi-processor machine, more than a WAV file can be encoded at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's what we have just finished the basic device of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as standard for each of a & CD; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music, you don't need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section we will be described as the process of how the music is set up and set up on the hard disk. first in the previous section, we will be able to pick up the & CD; data from freedb will be described in this section. the process of this section is described in this section, must be repeated for every pivotal & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1575">Because we are a & CD which is not included in freedb, you don't see a bit differently than those for a & CD; therefore, you will learn how to enter the & CD; data will need to pick up them on the Internet. comments are to be found on the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try don't want to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this Handbook.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not happened, it must now be the & CD; in the drive, which is defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the plays and their length of the window should be listed as shown in the screen photo. this only if the & CD can be identified as Audio CD; the audio CD can be read and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, you are searching for questions or replies after the help or go back to the previous section on the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD will be picked up by freedb, all titles of the pieces have already filled and additionally displayed the name of the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the case that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; you will select a window, and you can select the database entry, which fits your opinion the best on your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for automatic request by freedb (on the page & CD; settings in dialog for the settings), you can also select any local database, but data from the internet, you will need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD Editor - input of the CD data and Titels of the first unit</seg>
<seg id="1584">Specify the data for your & CD; according to the samples on the next screen photo, the title of the unit in the first line of the input field 'updates', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist does not need to be entered at the 'Aceller title', unless you have a composition of various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments of the album per piece, the comment field of the album will be used for comments on all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: according to the successful demand of the data from freedb, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD-Editors (e.g. all words begin with large letters or not...), but also to check whether it is any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. if you use ID3v2 tags, you do not have an unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; max. this option will be set in the tab settings; take a look into the section 'Basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the day information from the files later anytime with the Tag Editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coding and file formats. see you can see in the assistance to the code to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry which is obvious in the style of the privilege. for more information, please check the & CD's data. for more information on the site of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. Pop or Rap are available for example.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After the selection of 'OK, you come back to the main window. click on line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-Editors appears again and you will see that the fields for the album is filled with the entered data. enter the entries for the fields of the actual unit. enter the title of the unit on any case and any other information you want.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click the next line in the main window and enter the same way up to you all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear, if you have downloaded the data from freedb. it is sorted into one of these categories.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the tool bar. note that the artist and the album on the product list will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there are no check-in before each line of a product. just the titles that are selected or out. make sure that all pieces are selected, or if you select the Convert. all tracks select at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When clicking on the button, read the readout process, this window will be published for confirmation. click on OK, and then we will take a look at the window with the insert and track.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the riders orders to the switch on the order panel. it is available in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window for the control of jobs. the first piece is read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the program in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message you will try to work with a codierer but do not have yet installed. pieces were encoded with a red 'X' in the list of order.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the target ordner are not what we are entered in the example. if you have writing access to the folders for temporary files and the destination?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear, why the error occurs directly after the end of the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece from it, but we have completed a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. to be read and coding in parallel. please note the status in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration setting to be able to read this behaviour, the number of parallel processes can be unclear. the installed computer with an AMD64 seems to be no problem with simultaneous performance and coding (from there two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now, the last title is read, while another piece is encoded and is a third order in the waiting period. after the last piece is coded, a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator;, you need & KDE; 3.x or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you will need the coding of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1609">This section is to be designed to compile from source files, and not for users to use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for your needs to be adapted according to your needs, if it is at once, the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls for many different programs, has many varieties of settings. best read the step for step Example of options and settings to learn. it shows the photos of different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hi, still remember? even if the help menu after start-up time of the program is needed, no audio CD (especially if the time of the program is not audio CD; in the drive is), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What it does it? who reads this, probably the program has already started. it should look something like:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author can't add this manual for a manual to & kaudiocreator; but if you read it only after the contact intake of the author. and if you read this, it did not leave this section, and therefore they agree with this proposal.</seg>

<seg id="1633">If you want to set a event in a event, select from the menu the entries for the entries or play out. the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you can summarize. these will be played by a row. in this section, how you can use collections of data.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To set up a collection, you will open the collection manager. here you will find the menu collection under the point.... click there to New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You may also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then click the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the desired page in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection, all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When installing the application, this collection will not be saved. concerns the when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. click here to add a song. it again appears to select the file dialogue with which help you select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song, depends on the setup automatic to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic adding to the collection is activated, a piece when opening (using file opening or Drag & drop) automatically added to active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When automation is not activated for the collection, it is activated, the opening of a product collection is activated and turned out. this collection will continue to be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you'll need to open the collection manager, select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removing.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order, in which the songs can be played. if you select the following menu after the submenu sequence of the menu collections, the songs will be played in sequence, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove any random order in the menu, the order will be re-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To add a song, select it in the collection manager or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song you go on, select the knob next song, the entry next thing from the menu or press the arrow right.</seg>

<seg id="1650">In order to extinguish a collection, open the collection manager, select the moving collection and click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection can't be mistakenly deleted. however, it doesn't matter what they cannot be saved by & kmide; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is necessarily necessary for Synthesizers, which are not general-MIDI. in this case the MIDI-map General-MIDI events in events which understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the change Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the change Change patch to Trumpet and thus will always be a trumpet player when originally a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have a sound card, you don't need MIDI map because all sound card GM is compatible (incl. Awe and GUS-cards, FM radio devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There is unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps. so you have to edit the corresponding file of hand (with your favourite seditor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that saves all the required requirements for the play of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear only once, except the KEYMAP section, which is often appear as often. the condition is however, that every appearance is a different text (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">DEFINE PATCHMAP... END DEFINE KEYMAP "An additional keymap..." END DEFINE CHANNELMAP... END Options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that DEFINE is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for options) and END, that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send us your map file as an e-mail, so I can support in future versions of & kmide; support can be used for devices that are not general-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section will be specified, as the Patches of General MIDI to your specific Keyboard is shown as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the principle is ignored. it is assumed that GM -Patches are available in the correct sequence (from 0 to 127) you may not change the order, and does not have a line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is needed to convert all notes, which supports this instrument (GM-Patch 127), you can choose a drum (e.g. sound 60), which like a slipper. to accomplish this, you wear the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">If you want to play a MIDI file with a patch 127 (non-defenses), there's Patch 100 (the drum on your Keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that with the term Trommel Patch, please note that any sound is a few percussionment instruments (drum, tank, Maracas & etc;) and no one that means sound the sound height of the always same drum means (such as such a keyboard).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to specify how sounds can be seen on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Like the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of rows is very important, just as their availability. you must create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define for every channel and any instrument several keyboards. you have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly used to cut sounds on the pertinent Canal. look for example the supplied Keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to cut some channels on the other hand. if you want to use the first and to the second channel, you will simply make the whole of the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards that have performant on a specific channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section, i.e. 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, constructed according to the pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that need to use on the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap must be ignored, if you need to change the ForcePatch option, all events are ignored, which will try the patch on this channel. in this case you will always use patch x.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example, to use the pertinent patch on the pertinent Canal.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for the benchmark ratio is multiplied by a Pitch-Bender event. if a MIDI file is connected to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then forwarded by the formula n * (r / 4096), thus it is used in the map file no decimalmas).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM is necessary to play a keyboard with the value of 4096. unfortunately, some keyboards will try to play two sounds up to a octave higher. to find the correct value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmide;</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, open the dialog for MIDI settings. you can find in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole range of clavids (one for every MIDI channel). click on this pianos, which can be played by notes.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to modify the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a select list where you have a instrument, the button does not have green, but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to show the played sounds. the view of the menu adjustments under the point-view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">Pace LCD display shows the speed to play with the one song. higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a couch by changing a song. for example, you'll find a song to follow the text, you can change it slow. to change the pace, use the arrows turn left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played, the rhythm, the speed, & etc; so that the same MIDI file can lead to two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes on very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can use niemanden, & kmide; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while you can change a similar sound quality. with a MIDI file, you can change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have the control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This may happen when you have a Binärs (rpm, deb) from & kmide; without AWE support, you need to eliminate any source code and install a source file (for example from kmide; 's Startpage)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole file to a collection, but I don't want to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">However, therefore supports & kmide; Drag & drop. open the folder which you want to add in & Konqueror; choose all files from you, and draw it to the & kmide; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Keep in advance the adjustment of automatic adding to the collection. otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can select the arrow button on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow the playback. in order to add the standard tempo, you can click on the LCD double click.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I'm on a & KDE; works with my MIDI file and & kmide; if I want to play a karaoke file, or I would like to play a file to play only in the & contqueror; window changes and the desired file into the window of & kmide;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file, without having to add more to a collection, turn off the adjustment automatic to the collection, and the new; file will open to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.C and C.mid. you only want to play the first file. so, adjust the adjustment to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection, then exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then join the B.mide and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you make this?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you! if I see these songs or the postcard, animated me further to & kmide; program I see these songs.</seg>
<seg id="1695">I studied mathematics at the University of Mazia; Laga, Spain. at the moment I have not a lot of leisure for my hobbies, but I try to take me a bit time. when hobbies, I've got MIDI files, music and sets.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you want a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmide; or even if you want to make me happy, write me an e-mail: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. here is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is a information window which will be displayed only if the information is rescheduled.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to add the preferred connections among the menu mark, but this is individual entries if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, so you should use the category thumb playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional release, and will love his group and all its subgroups to the current category and play the playback starts with the adjusted entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current pieces', television and a permanent playlist can be modified, but can also be modified by an editor, but also by the use of a category climax, on the menu view, and next to the process control mode. due to the click of a subgroup, the XML content is displayed in the file.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you need to be selected from the menu of the same playlist and select either the processing mode, or select a different category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost if the processing mode is left or another group will be selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched by using the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during Starten and Being can be disabled by editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplaywc and Change from [general Options] No Intro = 0 obiger 'option'. if the option is not available, it can easily be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate a different animation. & kmplayer is also possible to activate the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / other ml / kmplayer / exit.xmml. the format must be aware of a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during Starten don't need to be too short, it will automatically terminated by opening a different source. this would be annoying with the end-animation, the user can end the application a second time.</seg>

<seg id="1722">There is no riders for this return device in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer. everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplaywc. here is an example like a 'flash' with the Module swfdec-mozilla:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash' can be played within & kmplayer. it can even be added to the special box for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>

<seg id="1726">This means a specified backend for a certain Mime Type (of course only if this was determined), this must be done by manual modification of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplaywc. for example, phono will play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kplayer can play with TV cards, either by means of the MPplayer or Xvideo (this need kxvplayer). if you need to use TV channels, the scanners can be used from the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (video data recorder) settings in the kmplayer, the dialog box is to be detected. there are ports be detected, from which one will be selected. for example, it must be found PAL for West Europe), the correct name has probably included a DVB t.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Because the VDR support from kmplayer can only work on the Linux server. this type is also supported on the X server. for the XFree86 server, it must therefore be included in the configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>

<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in individual types. everything concerning the possibilities and limits are placed in simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a day file document. it can only contain only once in a document where it can contain definition of many tags, but it does not contain any type of element that is nothing else.</seg>

<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful shareholders. with the help of this promotion, it is not limited to use (or parts of the document), it is not limited. examples of & quantaplus; even the quick start-up dialog, or the different ones in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">As the first, the name of the scripts and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are recommended, it is recommended to use the% off the variable in the command line: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / course in your path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>

<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group. in the case they are not quite different, therefore one can create a tool bar with the name of the market-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add campaigns and configure the promotions. select the actions of the actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this type are quite self-explanatory. press the new action button at the bottom end of the window, editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill all the necessary fields and add it the day for the right tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day Attorso, and you are planning to edit the dialog box "day," if available, so a input at the promotion is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is a symbol symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? we replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">For creating a symbol that the action will be better, we will use & kiconfer: choose from the & kmenù;, graphics, more programs (or where else it is situated in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconfer, used as standard 32x32 pixel, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose edit size and others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="2047">In terms of mind that day is, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. however, the use of green (green is usually interpreted as los, starte, even further), or should at least, a message for users shall be put on this symbol; if a day is put in the current document;</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating a symbol, it must still be connected to the action. this occurs via the menu with the actions of the settings. (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired promotion. in addition to the text field there is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">In the folder, select the files stored in which the stored symbol is, select it and confirm you with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the application button and put it with other tags, so it's still that you are OK or confirm you with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantaplus; functions for the tool bar or it should be shared to a better overview by some Trenner in several groups. open the tool bar dialog for Settings. make sure that the required tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the Trenner (quite left) for my tool bar. after the selection of the element which is added to the tool bar, press the arrow button to the right. this add the element to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I want to add a fast way to access the cross-cross section. I will select and add it to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note like Trenner support grouping. someone who does not know my tool bar, could believe that the & Conqueror; button on the opposite of the start-up is.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new tool bar must be tested by props all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the real file. after NeueXML does not exist, it will be stored in the real folder but your tool bar must be loaded when your tool bar is charged (n), if a file is open (n), if a file is open.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the chosen expansion of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the shape language which you like this chapter, how I describes a & PHP, document tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; repository check whether someone has already done for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. first part we left you to treat the second.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Context file [Tree] Doc you = path, relatively 1, day 2, tag1 = Sec2.3.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.3.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.2.html = Sec2.3.html = Sec2.2.html tag1 = day 1.html day1 = tagon1 = day 2.html daytime 3 = day 3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see in the & PHP; documentation so something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc Documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started = regulation .html Getting Started = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = Basic syntax = .html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Please note # # Getting Started and Language reference. this is showing that it is a subordner in tree with its own contents. there is no known limit for chess of deep deep (except for understanding) mdash; but try them out.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the contents of contents directly is referenced to a file (and consistent with the upper end of the structure & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces contain nothing but pay attention to & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; the cendateries will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The contents of the content of the context is sensitive to context sensitive help. for example, if writing on the mysql _ fetch _ array can be displayed. by markings the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context-text list (Context List) and the file extension lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate context elements that will be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can simply convert your file docrc to save your file / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / query / doc or global use. then create a folder (such as you specified this file in your file like docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that this well and it's worth to be shared by using important information, e.g. what documentation is used to use & quantaplus; -Repository for use by the & quantaplus; -the community will not be rich, but we are proud to have worked with the best webdevelopment platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; they are not alone. it is possible to divide the other Resources (DTEP packages, tool bar with actions, scripts, templates) to others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or else. at different places there is an email entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email copy, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripted tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded in our head archive, where all other & quantaplus can be checked, where our team would need to make a useful contribution to make an GPG / PGP key. so that the source of the resources will be ensured, both for our team as well as for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When you upload, you will need to be looking for their private GPG key (the Passphrase are not stored), or in the case you can check out the input fields (URL preview can empty the input fields) and with the click of OK.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The unloading can be uploaded by menus DTD DTD package (DTEP) to upload tool bar, and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading the resource, there is a resource requirement before installing the integrity and the Signization. in case of problems, the warning messages can be observed. if the integrity was given and the resource correct, the message appears to be correct, is a message with the message of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work to XML-languages, which is currently supported by creating a DTEP package, but it may be more complicated because hundreds of day files in the day XML format is necessary. there's a simple way to convert a DTEP package to a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started by the DTD menu and conversion of a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. afterwards, the following dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name to the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder with this name.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE definitions: the drawing chain which is used in! DOCTYPE Day, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 /</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of DTEP according to the transformation: when activated, & quantaplus; according to the conversion & file descriptionrc; Editor, it can be adapted to the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there is some key concepts. in order to understand these concepts and full benefit from & quantaplus, this chapter is to accommodate this concepts, without their understanding, without their understanding and quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the workarea is divided into three areas: global, locally, and projection related to a range of components in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for each, the & quantaplus, which is selected as a globally marked, in the common party structure of & quantaplus; this enables the group of administrators to secure different tool bar, actions and patterns in the global tree to provide each in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements provide a personal collection of web development for individual users. these are custom-specific patterns and tool bar. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be found all of all types of specific actions especially for the files of a specific project. all elements are stored in the folders of the project, which means that the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project emögi.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several major areas: the editors window, the building views, the stables with info and the tool bar. please make sure and for more information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the box with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as the current, other or any security system, extinguish, delete or uploading of the document, jump to a reading mark or execution of CVS commands to the actual document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">A further context menu in the editorial area lead to a further context menu (cut / copy / enter), editing the word under the mouse-hand or opening the file, if the drawing chain under the mouse-pointer is a file named.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editors is the tool bar at the end of the editors. currently, & HTML; 4,01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of tool bar is shown. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplus, the tool bar will be adapted to the new functions and therefore associated user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bar is really easy. if you want to add a single day, then click the icon to enter the day. if you want to enter the data for this straight, you should add a day to fill the several attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialogue with different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building views (QIT;) allow for information on & quantaplus; for example, to open them and strides. in the presentation with antiques are available for files, project, samples, document, attributes, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that is providing & quantaplus. this view shows all files in the project and allows you to remove the files stored in the project by means of right mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything you can use a template: images, program parts, a whole website & etc; There are all options open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories into which it depends on the category. global templates are always available, local templates only available for the corresponding user and templates in projects are only available in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripts. the concept of the integration in Global, Lokal and Project works here. by clicking the right mouse button, further functions are available, such as script will start, edit or send us an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, the internal structure of the active document has been set out. through links to a new element, the cursor is set on the position of the element. through right click of an element, a list of commands is open to navigation and collection of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among other construction views. with it, it can change manly attributes to the attributes. this tree allows to modify the contents in the contents, the change of all available attributes with a few mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of Web-technology for your development. you can download it, you can create their own documentation, and by adding a letter to a project, a project can add project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two carton at the lower end of the window, on the useful information can be achieved: the news window and the problem windows.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This carton shows information about each in Quanta subscript. such as the DTD to the current document and all modifications are displayed in DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This carton shows all error in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are carried out, give all error messages (such that are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">S & quantaplus; factory-bar are extensive and easy to understand. show it on a symbol and they receive the appropriate order. the chocolate set aside the tool is the possibility to define its own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">A further function of & quantaplus is the ability to send a tool bar by e-mail. if you receive a tool bar at an email. if you get a tool bar at an email, they can be able to secure them in & quantaplus; just like any other secure and download!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of & quantaplus; files to your system. in order to get to configure a complete list of options on the configure. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you wish to check the problems of & quantaplus, you should check whether your path contains the & KDE; 3 file, you should make sure that does not have older version of & KDE; 3 in the PATH. your folder is valid for & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus, is a web development tool for the KDE surface. it has been optimised for rapid Web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While the effort, the best & HTML Editor, the developers of & quantaplus started to deal with a close-up idea: what would like & quantaplus; now, this would be an independent web development tool for & KDE; so it's done so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Not longer on pure & HTML; limited, & quantaplus should be summed on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. it can be summed in & XML, so you should use & quantaplus; therefore the appropriate & IDE should be.</seg>

<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled out at the top of the project, for example, according to the evaluation of the project, all these paths and author information can be completed later with Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering name, the name will automatically be filled out file.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in small book and no spaces with the extension of webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the server address of the machine, which you want to access local data. either one name (hostname.exemplary .de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>

<seg id="2161">That is the folder where the tool is stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and standard toolbars. if a joint collection of files used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to add files from the local file system into the project. it can be selected several files or entire folders.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great, if you want to download static Webinlet, you want to download and modify. in case of sereive scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you must go different.</seg>
<seg id="2164">If files that are stored anywhere in the main ordner of the project, if a project is started on new, not anaken if the project is not started.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Using this option all files and folders are displayed in the main course and can be seen from a detailed selection of reviews.</seg>

<seg id="2175">In the lower event configuration, you can modify the event actions, change or delete them. event actions will be carried out if a previously particular event will act as such as the fears of a file. see in the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus will open the last project, which was opened. this behaviour you can not influence this behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a project, select the Project.... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool bar. the dialog box is displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus is closed, the project file will be automatically stored. you will be asked if you want to save changes when & quantaplus; this is done when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project development is free access to the files in the project. you can manage files on the current project in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder behavior as well, however, the entries open and opening with... in the right mouse button-call Context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here, various profiles can be sought here. the profile contains information about the place of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows to remove the current profile. if only a profile is present, the button is left to prevent the removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Password is not forgotten in the core memory and for programming. this option is useful if frequency upload of files is needed and the rather unsecure password on the plate is not required in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">That will stop the transmission or simply left the dialog, when you change your opinion from the high load.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high loading profiles can be uploaded and therefore the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different server. when editing or creating a profile is displayed on this dialog box:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server that will be copied to the files. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address.</seg>
<seg id="2187">A transfer protocol for the high load. the list depends on the version of & KDE; and the installed KIO slaves. at least, you should choose from & FTP, a file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Port for transfers. normally, this must not be changed, except the network administrator operates a service not to the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your account, this is either a time-saving function or a risk. if the password is stored on the plate, so it is not easy to read, but each with programmer can see it easily in the plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and tool bar. it can be loaded into a project of many views, which means other files and tool bar, replace various files and tool bar, replace the files and tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be reached in the menu or the project tool bar, which are stored on the tool bar project, be opened or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has to do most of them. this helps increase productivity, but also allows the adjustment of & quantaplus; its own work is also possible.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above is the tool bar at & quantaplus; the best-down menu tool bar can be stacked. use and adding them. adding tool bar is treated at the section of the tool bar at the bottom section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The tool bar and symbols can be set either by means of the context menu (right to the tool bar), which can be set to adjust other actions such as toolbar, which can be set to the dialog box, which can be displayed in the dialog box to be visible on this or other tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By call of the context menus for a promotion (symbol) on a tool bar, in addition the entries are removed and the action are displayed, self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The tool bar and the actions of them can set up on them in the menu with the same tool bar... and settings actions be set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are templates for a common file, code-Schnitzel and files as a common file system. you can move like a common file system with an extended organisation and interfaces. it is templates in & quantaplus; in about those restrictions you have to filesystem the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; the supplied template for their use. please read the conditions before the use of each template conditions in front of the use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Bind is everything, what does not exist. there's any file except text, e.g. images, & PDF; s, Flash-files and etc. (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url) are inserted. some examples are found in the prestige of a global template. further information for templates tree is available in.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text documents. based on this template documents, new documents can be prepared for the purpose and organises the work in the corresponding way to be efficiently. some examples can be found in the pre-run tree. see for more information to templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should be add up to a full menu of up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. some examples are given in the prestige of a global template. see for more information to templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates for all sites are templates. they are a collection of different documents that can be arranged in a folder structure and can be summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples of & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure according to exposure (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select the file when you save the local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as the happened is, you notice that (even if it has been stored as a project task) the model was not visible in the project tree. look at the prestige of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on file as a template selection as local / project file. alternatively, the option can easily be moved with Zipping and dismantling to the structure of the building.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file is just enough to copy the file management functions, so that all file management functions can be used, such as bricks and insert or add over the file tree from Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select any file or in the project files or in the project files, click on a folder on the right and site template. by default, the project is secured, but of course, it can be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project pre-up and a very targeted pre-oriented approach. you can make headlines and foot-lines, or dynamically set with PHP; design, files into or with them. additionally, some things can keep some things during the use of templates in projects very deep in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The implant structure based on the lower window is based on the $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / common and $HOME / .kde / share / accommodation unit. each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of containers, as described above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behaviour of a party, in order to click the folder with the right mouse button on the folder and to select the context menu tab. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is low as soon as Alsatian Attorso is intact.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is activated as standard, if a triordner would be noticed, except they would be explicitly enabled in this path. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text-Baustein. if nothing appears to be there, one is likely to be found in a triordner.</seg>
<seg id="2213">You can also be ordered or modified text for templates in this folder. this could be the headlines or foot lines for all template templates in a folder with special headlines / footlines, and try out a whole presentation already with the matching headlines / foot lines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, the context menu (this show, right mouse button) can be used on a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and add-mail templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus features two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & Source Editor, which can be reached via the VPL Editor and the Second shares the editors box in two parts: the source text Editor and the VPL Editor-editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; Editor works as follows: it charges a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; then you can edit and when needed for source code Editor, in which the safety changes in VPL-Editor can be seen in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; Editor, it is possible to edit a small symbol of the Vohandler from PHP; source code. to edit & PHP; it is still necessary to process the source code Editor. there's no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode is just like the first, except that the changes are activated in the source code editors and the VPL Editor-editor. with pressures of F9, this mode is activated, this mode is activated, the button to keep the active cursor from a window onto it which will retain the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; Editor and the source code editors can be set between synchronisation in one click or automatically. in the selection, the recommendation can be set automatically. basically, the recommendation can be adjusted for fast and a large donation for slow machine.</seg>
<seg id="2220">It is supposed to change the title of the website, so it is possible to choose any document with the VPL Editor -editor. this document will be created as soon as a new document with the VPL; Editor is created. this makes it possible to change the tolerant.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags for storing information about the document self-search for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below. click on the list the content of content, such as keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of design for the use of pages in the browser. you can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change on the list is exactly as with the meta-elements. editing and CSS rules are currently supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to connect to an external CSS style file, enabling you to connect to the file button and select the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursors is like in a text processing, due to the parts. under rare circumstances, the cursor is still used. the text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted by inserting and reset button or remove the back button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insert of tags is made in the same way beyond the tool bar, such as the source code editors. if an anchor day is not removed, e.g. an anchor day, surround with the text, any other convertible anchor drops must be removed.</seg>

<seg id="2274">On systems with installed readline library, you can upgrade with the arrow keys to / from now on display units from now on.</seg>
<seg id="2275">Several commands can require more than an argument. & eg: with the command "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;" as an arguments, a holding point in a file with the name "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;."</seg>
<seg id="2276">Template _ NAME: a valid name of a template that consists only from the ASCII characters 0x00 to 0x7F. this name can be a completely qualified name like "XSL: templatename."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for the same. why therefore & kdiff3;? let me explain, why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merging was very complicated because one of the contribution was made possible because, at the same time, a further programmers had changed a lot in the same file. the result was many conflicts in the merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program showed me only the changed lines, but I couldn't see what exactly what happened within these lines. and there were no indications on putting the places where the merging of these changes was a small album space.</seg>
<seg id="2284">So, this was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3 was able to show differences within a line and changes in white signs. later, any number of other useful functions were added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to compare my text, copy it simply to the intermediate level and add it in one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work, was the same and merge perform folders. this function related & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way-merge works completely, if two people do not work independently of one piece co-work and changes in the automatic case. in this editor you can even edit the results even directly. in this editor, the screen photo shows three Quell files at the merge:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you with the same and merge, complete folders. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; in the folder:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and user-driven ways with the possibilities of today's colour monitors. if you have to check out this function you like.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs, one can see a look at the column in the column on the left side. (no trouble with more if JNO changes.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal to, and the other is different in a line, then the colour is different. red color means that both can distinguish themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same names, but in various folders, you can facilitate the Tipparagus by choosing only the filenames in the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Folders 1, folder 2, diffuse, diff3 folders 1 Ordner1 Ordner2, tier 3 folders 1 Ordner1 Ordner2 Ordner3 folders</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog box allows you to open a choice of file browser (file...) or select a most recently opened file. it doesn't need to specify a third file. if you need to check the entry for C, the analysis of the differences is carried out with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">When you select a folder where you can select a folder, if you select a folder, if you select a folder, for B and C, I used a folder, then use & kdiff3; filenames from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merase is set up, the input field will be active for the purpose. however, it is not necessarily necessary to specify a output file. you can do this step even later on the memory.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-up will open a dialog with Settings. you can set the options before you start using the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes, you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. it allows you to select text boxes in the active comparative window. compared to the opening dialog, you do not select any files you can easily connect to the dialog with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use Zient and retrieval: pull out a file from a file manager or selected text from one editor, and let it drop him via a settlement window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">That thought behind it? sometimes contains a file like many similar functions. you would need to create a relatively large effort. they would have to add two corresponding files, they would be in & kdiff3; then compare the relevant sections simply to copy and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can pull anything from & kdiff3; only pull the case of text in a reference window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the Zipping and retrieve of text into another program as a cut and add (instead of copying and single). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text box is the info number A, B or C, the filenames and the number of the first visible line. (when the path comes to a file), you will rest a while on the line. then a little relief window will be displayed on the line.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three sources are the letters A, B and C. A has the color blue, B the colour green and C is magenta. (this default can be changed over the settings menu).</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, one can see the color in the color, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. this is good in the next section (merge updates).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Right next to the text, the column is displayed. when differences in white signs, the colour is not so important to see the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, relevant for Preprocessor and in few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the summary of the text, is interrupted by the positions where the respective source file does not have any lines. if the twinning is activated, the line is represented on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The results window (under the settlement) has also has an info-on line with the inscription: the filenames and [changes] if you have the result. usually, it contains text, but often also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! to all conflicts, the storage needs to be disabled!!! (use the buttons) in the most unsolved / unged conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison can be used, each difference is also solved a conflict in the case that can be changed manually at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking one of the left mouse button in one of the window will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. (this will then be the current group.) This is then the current group. it will be produced with color background color for current area and each on the left appears as a black beams.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, no further line will be left in the group; then this is a place for the case that you change your mind and perhaps again a different source. this text does not appear again in the final file, nor in a sign that you might perhaps copy and differently.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merges contours; however, if you copy this text if you copy a text from the results window. do not go through this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if the sources choose the options, ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">To use the mouse buttons, you can use the keyboard buttons to the right, then you can use the keyboard buttons on the right side, at the beginning, the end, trl-at and shrub at the end, which can also be used by other programs. the vertical column next to the vertical frame bar can also be used.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the Augabee window, you can also use the other keys to editing. with the single button, you can switch between infeed and backpack mode. (default is the insertion mode).</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the merging columns we synchronize the view of all windows on the beginning of the respective group (as described in the section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar also contains seven buttons on navigation with which you can jump to the next / previous conflict (Strg / Ctrl / Ctrl) or next to the next / previous conflict. therefore, you do not continue to dissolve itself as a conflict. therefore, the conflict must be distinguished between the most important and unsolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking within the intermediate position, you need to copy the copying button (Strg-C or Strg) option. if this is activated, the copy will be automatically copied, and you will be careful with this option but you could not write the contents of the intermediate position.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeileners are stored according to the underlying operating system. UNIX variants are using a Zeilencode\\ r\ '. Kdiff3 reserves the tick-up of the source files, so you should use & kdiff3; also do not use binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically and restored with the next start. (Menu adjusting element - &gt; Kdiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a writing with fixed width. (on a few systems the dialog with variable width is available for selection, you should not use this writing.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you want to activate this option, differences in curly writing. if the chosen writing is not supported, this representation happened.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be gerastert. on this systems the button is automatically set an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is activated, the pressing the Tabulator button is inserted for the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise a Tabulator is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When using input or return, the retrieval of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is activated, every choice will be copied automatically into the intermediate level. the manual copy is cut into the intermediate level.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select what Zeilenende type you prefer to save. the default value is the general selection of the used operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">First step is trying to find & kdiff3; first, all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white signs are ignored. the second step is not ignored. in this step white signs will not be ignored. also, white signs are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) you want to look back with different sizes in\\ 'at the end of a row, but you could only save files with different sizes on the side effects. however, if this option is enabled, however, the option must be disabled. during the merge, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default setting this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and related characters ('0' - '9', '' ') ignores. in the result, the differences are still indicated, but they are treated as white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In the default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated as changes in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively after a smaller differences, the option is enabled in the default. it is effective at complicated and large files, but slowly at very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">As long-to-jump mode, this setting is indicated as long as the result of the selection, before the next uneven conflict will continue straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="2335">It is useful if the selected file is used as a source. (default is manual option). if you want to use white characters in many files. please note that the Automatic option may also be used in numbers or comments if the options are ignored, or Ignoriere C / C + + Comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">This options will be treated in Chapter to a scanning of folders and lead to a merge. look for details under documentation on the directory-comparing and consignment.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already a older version, the original version will be accessed using the Suffix .original file, if there is already a backupfile with the Suffix .original file, this file is removed without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">This option is not the language of the user interface. it does not need & kdiff3; finish and relaunch, making the change. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language there is globally beyond the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following coding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, it will be used for all entries in the upper setting.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Via the select fields for the coding appears to be a short notice that the local coding is. (this may not be changed and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Fit the file encoding for source files. this is affected, how special characters are treated and interpretations. since the encoding for each file can be adjusted individually, even files can be compared with different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have a file, you can set here you specify what coding is to be used.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands it might be possible to work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only be encoded with 8-bit ASCII.) to this option you can define the coding of the pre-processing procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch it from the highlighting of changes in white characters in the text or overview periods. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ignoriere C / C + + Comments ")</seg>
<seg id="2345">This option is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, you can see only the differences between two of the three files. after selecting A & lt; B, A & B; -b; C or B & lt; C is indicated in addition to the normal one second oversized column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes one wants to use the available space on the screen for long lines. dazzle you simply use the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Ordnet the comparison window side by side or overone another. this can also be useful to display of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes, you can compare the differences and decide to start the files. a simple click starts using the file name and uses the file name for output file. (if this function is used to start the merge, then the name of the most recently used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">In case of a file, it becomes visible in this external command. in & kdiff3, the output of the command is visible, and not the file yourself. you can write your own preprocessor that is precisely to your needs. for example, this function can be used for out interference-out parts or retracting any file.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is specified in this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified, the issue of this command is only used for the case. you can write your own preprocessor that corresponds to your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought of it is, the user needs more flexibility when changing the diff results. however, an external program needs to program, and most users want to program even program. the Good news is that in most cases sed or perl completely.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preprocessing line for Zeilenoid in order to convert the input in large letters: the\\ 's /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' s this process is found on the found text in the first Klammera few.\\ U turns the first text in large letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems are required to use the following pattern: the\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you knew experimenting, maybe you begin to understand it and maybe you like this regular expressions. you are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The Ignorms of numbers is actually a built-in function in Kdiff3. however it is good as an example of a further pre-processing order for Zeilenabstened. "s / [0123456789.-] / / g 'each of the character between' ['and'] 'is a Treffer, and every Treffer will be replaced by nothing, thus unmistakenly deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes, you would like to perform several successes on once. then you can use the Semikolon ';' to separate the texts of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead, you can also use some different ways like perl. perl -p -e's / REGEXP / Erl / SCHALTER 'allergens are needed in perl some details. where the\\\\\\\' s requires perl only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data on the normal preprocessor are retain for the display and to perform, the other operations can only change the data that the Zeilenabnormal-Algorythm can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Please note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the Zeilencode preprocessor looks the issue of the normal price processor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with each function, the text changed or differences, you may not notice certain differences, and in the worst case important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmer must be edit in a folder of many files. therefore, you can compare with & kdiff3; complete folders and merge together.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal to merge a proposal; you can adapt the proposal before the start</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate simulate simulated changes and simulated the simulated changes, without having to perform,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... select selected campaigns either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is the same and merge of individual files very similar. you have to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders will be merged, then Ordner1 is used as the basis. if no target submissions was used, uses & diffuse 3; Ordnered 3 as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will automatically be able to start the merge. to start the merge, you have to select the corresponding menu entry or the F7 key press. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During the reading of the folder you can break a little news on the current progress. if you break the scanning of the folder, only the files listed, which were compared to then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When the scanning of the folder is finished, & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left-hand side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and each folder of the scan has been found here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click here.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually represented. you can click on the + / - click on the object, or by clicking the arrow keys for your left / right. the directory menu includes two functions. all options can be folded and can be folded in which you can open all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you click on a file, click the file comparison and it appears on a settlement.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol of the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. this types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the type of file type in the other folders is visible, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane. in such a case, the grouping action can't be chosen automatically. if the merge is started, you will further be informed about any problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As in the above picture, you will see in columns A / B / C the colours red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, the colour is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folder are identical as identical as their whole content is identical. then, the same color does not have the same color. for folders, the age is unsignificant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea to this color scheme is based on dirle. colours are the colours of a leaflet again, which is only green, then yellow it becomes and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C is identical but not to B: copy of B (or if B doesn't exists, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C is identical but not a: copy of A (or if A doesn't exists, delete the target) if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C does not have the same datatype (e.g. if a folder and B one file): fault: contradictory file types. as long as such faults objects can exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same datatype (e.g. if a folder and B one file): fault: contradictory file types. as long as such faults objects can exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode to synchronisation is active, if only two folders and no more explicitly point target, then select & kdiff3; the necessary action taken from the file that both folders are identical. if necessary for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: together, and the result in both folders. (the user can see as a visible file name for output file only B; directly after the merge & kdiff3; B after A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are activated, then the date of files are activated (uncertain), but the same date will error error: files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such error are not allowed, the merge perform the folder can't be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While the merge will perform a file after another. you perform status column, if the merge has been successfully completed, and according to other tunes, if the merge has been completed, you should see a last review and see whether the status is everywhere in order.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog will be chosen for the file-comparative Analysis, KDiff3 will contain further columns. these contain the number of invalids, not white and white conflicts. (the column of the conflicts is displayed only if three folders are compared or assembled together.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either select the only selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries once again. if you have chosen all interconnected actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note that if you have no target set, then in the Three-folder mode C, you will be used as a target as a target of the two-folder merge, B and / or B will be used as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have chosen a target date, please check if all entries should be displayed in the target structure. there are some options by using certain entries could be shot. check the options by unwilling surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To support all entries in the directory: select the directory running / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the keyword). in order to perform only the current entry: select the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If due to conflicting datatypes still exist, a message appears on the incorrect elements. you can select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Once you perform all the entries, a dialogue is appears with the options running, Simuulate and break.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Choose Simuulate if you would like to see what would happen without the really changes. you will then get an exhaustive list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then specific actions with all entries are required. if a manual procedure is necessary (together with a single file), then a merge windows (please note the screen photo).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are ready to start your file, select a directory running / continue, or press F7. if you are not stored, a corresponding dialogue appears. then, & kdiff3 will continue his work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3, you will see a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will need some error messages to skip you the problem of the problem. so you have the possibility to select a different action for entry or any other way before you continue with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries are individually combined, & kdiff3; these entries are not stored together. even if you have shown that the entries have been done, or not stored, these entries are carried out. only if you change the merge action, these entries are again assembled together.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; KDef3...) now has a section called directory connection with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that can be displayed in the element tree. separate samples are entered. separate space holder: '*' and '?'. (e. g. * .cpp; * .h). default is *. folders must not correspond to this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders correspond to this pattern, not in the element tree. it can be entered as a sample, use the Semikolon; as a separator. valid space holder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original. * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders correspond to this pattern, not in the element tree. it can be entered as a sample, use the Semikolon; as a separator. valid space holder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original. * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that would be ignored by CVS. many autmatic is ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this order is specific with a .cvsignore file. (check out at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files are hidden and hidden in other filesystem. this option can decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not. this option is switched on the default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When links to files: if the option is switched, symbolic link is compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to the links below. this is enabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Links to the folder: if the option is switched on, if the option is switched on a file. if the option is switched on a link to a computer, it would lead to a final loop (& kdiff3; the option is switched off.) This option is switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Complete analysis of each file has a complete analysis of each file and shows the statistical analysis. the full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when they are used on files that do not contain any text. (give an appropriate type of anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare big folder via a slow network, it is possible to compare the file date, and the file size to compare the file size. this speed advantage is not a certain level of safety. please use caution. this option is in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similarly, the files shall be considered as identical. the files will be considered as identical if they are equal. for example, if you want to recover, if you use the copy of the date, please use caution. this option is in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activated the synchronisation mode when two folders were compared and no target command. in this mode the proposals will be identical to that both folders are identical. even the results from the files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copying of the newer file is suggested as action. (this will not be aware that the other file doesn't have changed. you should check this in any case.) This option is switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file is replaced or deleted by a file or deleted, the original version will be renamed. if a old backup file is already deleted, this is the default function of single files, not only the merging of individual folders. this option is switched on the default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder-merge updates will be visible. if you don't want to move the window with the mouse. if you don't want to move the windows directory on the window, the Window window will switch off the window between directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file with double clicking on the menu. nevertheless, you can save the function of your single file. once you want to save the status, the status is set out, and the file doesn't run again if you run the folders.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is lost, if you read the directory once again: directory menu: new read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparent with the help of KIO slaves. Kdiff3 used to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders to open the files that are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things you should note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path may be relatively short. or... this is not possible with URLs not possible, these are always absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be mapped. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces, &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes, because of the filesystem on the server, sometimes through the used protocol. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it may not be distinguished whether a link to a file or a folder shows. then a file is accepted as a link target. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to process permission or change date. therefore, the permission or change date of original file. (please note the option of the size of the size.) (this is only possible with local files).</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently known as a difference of differences in KDevelop. KDevelop is first to start the differences of the difference. to shoot Kdiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences and then select in Kdiff3Part out of the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally you need & kdiff3; two complete input files; if it takes place, & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the Patch-file. at least one of the two files must be exist. then & kdiff3; the program patch to be missing in the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In Konqueror, you can select a Patch-file, and select from the context menu preview in - Kdiff3Part. please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists. in addition, this is unreliable, if the original files have been changed since the creation of the Patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is carried out, it only supports the same amount of two files, a very small tool bar and menu. the merging or the same of folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name of KDiff and Kdiff2 (now heet is compliare). in addition, the name Kdiff3 has already shown that it may lead, such as the diff3 program from the Diff Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use the GPL programs already very long and I have learned plenty of other programs in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or go it.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have not compiled a program from sources and configure the correct PREFIX to KDE but then can't find KDE for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc), and can't find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters are differently; however, these lines will be different as identical; however, the line is not identical as a non-white signs, the line is not identical to the number of signs at the next to each other, this adis cooperatives. this is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor is in any difference in the files where he begins and turn. this important information is needed, if the result is simply saved as text file, and it is easy to create, extra to create an own file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort was so far too large. you can always use a certain version always through the outlet of a source A / B / C. in order to handle larger quantities of text, one other editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After remove the text is suddenly; No src left; published and the text is not extinguished. what does this means and how can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses many colours as an differences between differences and differences. even more highlighting would be confused and missing the purpose. please use another editor for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and troubleshooting came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you will need & KDE; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">You can use KDef3 to other platforms without KDE, you can find at the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of last changes are found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the Changelog file in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & kdiff3; installed on a system with & KDE; use the following command in the base ordner of & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-You gives the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are sure to find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake should not have any problems when compressing. should still occur, report on the & KDE; mailing lists of them.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Umschalt) copied into the intermediate situation and results of the selected text. add (Ctrl-V or Shift) add the text from the intermediate position on the current cursor position, or replaces the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files listed in all folders are not appear in the order structure, and therefore not in the target sector.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the current version version you have to read the folder with the function updating to this options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries are displayed, the differences have not show that identical files are not already copied in the target. if the target command will not be missing, they are missing according to the merge. (the behavior will likely change in a later program version) this option is switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Check the buttons for selecting the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar, check the lines from the corresponding window at the end of the selected groupset (if they are already present), if the lines are already present, they are again removed on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In the default, this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager is quite convenient to watch all virtual desktop space. it is quite convenient to modify the current programs to the work area, their size to change it or to move them. this works both within a working area and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager is able to display all virtual desktop space as well as in this applications. applications can be selected and even within the work surface and to other moves.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the mean mouse button, windows within & kpager can be moved; the movement is possible both within a working area and other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on the empty background of & kpager. however, the context menu has only the two entries within & kpager; there is also the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries due to the entries, i.e. the work area and beating. commands the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window onto the full size of the working area. appears only if on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application for the selected virtual desktop space. only if an application was clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows within the & kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the work surface and to be moved to other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, are displayed in & kpager, the names of the virtual desktop area.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Check the field this field leaves the & kpager; the numbers of virtual desktop space. it's made along with name, the names will be provided with atomic numbers, & eg; 1st floor space.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background is displayed in the background area as a background in the & kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the ongoing programmes are displayed as small window in the & kpager; in otherwise you will appear only the empty work area to enable your selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. the window with its standard symbol symbol window. symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and pixel map shows a small view of the real programme. remark: pixel map is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of & kpager can be determined here: classic & kpager can be known as from Pager applications; horizontal driving displays all virtual desktop space in a horizontal and vertical series, which is very well suited for the display at the area of the working area.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager can be used as an alternative to the Pager miniature program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, the windows or with their content, it is also running outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & kpager; and subsequent installation of switch-on... lets you appear to set the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this may not be changed in the dialog settings, but you can do manually do this:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor like e.g. & kedit; or vi. Falls for the file, you need to register your system administrators. in this file, you have to set the key windowns transparent and set it a value. possible values:</seg>

<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly enhanced with new functions. it is optimised for use on high-performance transformers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">If you start & kmag; see the main window of & kmag; the main window is displayed on the screen. in the following this window is displayed as the magnification window. the image is displayed in the magnification window, is a enlarged area of the screen and is described in the following a selection box.</seg>
<seg id="2483">The standard setting increases & kmag; alternatively, you can use & kmag; alternatively, you can use a selected screen area at the magnification window (a select fenstermode) or the surrounding of the mouse vessel at the edge of the screen (eg; on the left screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">Would you avoid that the mouse pointer is displayed in the enlarged window, select the mouse poetic. at present, it is not able to recognize the shape of the mouse port. this is always the standard KDE; / Qt; -mouse-mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection mode, you can change the selection box to your own needs. you can change it with the arrow and mouse buttons and its size. this can be made in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnification window and hold the left mouse button, so you can move the contents of the magnification table and move. this goes also with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you need to press the & Shift; button press or the MMB; you can move the selection box.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination, you can change the size of the selection box. note that the upper left corner of the selection of a select stand is remains only the lower right corner.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the expanded picture directly to the printer, in a file, to copy it into the intermediate position (to insert it later into other applications), the image and much more.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool as soon as the mouse-mouse becomes a while on the same place. it is intended to help people who suffer from the RSI syndrome (repetitive-in-increment syndrome) and of which each mouse click pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool as soon as the mouse-mouse is thought to help people who suffer from the reetitive Straps in Ink (RSI), and of which every mouse click pain. moreover, it is also a little exercise with the mouse. however, this requires a little exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool as can use the pain in the mouse, and helps you to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you can mount a doctor with the use of your computer, if you are looking for a doctor if this is not done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & kmousetool; pain, it helps with pain in the mouse, it can be used against pain, which caused by the mouse due to the mouse. the result can be used for each range of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitor your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you break the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">This is the intelligent shift, it is activated by the end of the movement, before the sumption of the mouse button is executed. on this way, you can execute the mouse button of the mouse button. this way, the intelligent turn, requires a little exercise, but you get rid of it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This worsening time must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; one mouse click here.</seg>
<seg id="2504">It is a powerful displacement, the shooting field is switched (1 / 10 s), when the mouse button is waiting for the mouse button, before the mouse button is ready, if there is not a funnel due to the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool as well, this function is activated by a slow mouse. this movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, if & kmousetool as well; the first time, it can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound delayed, you can move the & KDE, let's move to sound & multimedia, select the sound system and here the rider General. there is a sliding sound buffer, which you can set to a lower value to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">This setting is marked by & kmousetool; for every start of & KDE; this function is currently available only under & KDE; in case of GNOME or other window, please send the respective documentation to figure out what you will automatically start there.</seg>
<seg id="2508">If all settings are back on the values, which were set when opening the dialogue. have already the button of the button, you will have set the settings on the stand after the last pressures of application.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool as well; initially with the default. in particular the intelligent move, you should first read the automatic mouse click, then you can turn to the intelligent move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the readable click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & KDE; if you want to reduce the response times of & KDE;</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should make sure to make a mouse click without effect: the click on the neutral components of windows or to places in the browser window which does not contain any link. you can use the mouse to such places, until you wish to use them back.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse printer should be able to clean your mouse. this is normally pretty easy. the trick is that you will not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles, which come with the mouse ball in contact with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to take the mouse of the mouse. as this happens, is from mouse to mouse differently. it should be clear if you see the base of mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have the ball, you would have to see the ball. these are located on the sides of the Loches, in which the ball was used. the Dreck and the contamination can easily be easily accessible with a flat blade or fingerning.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system used by & kmousetool; if in this case, if you use the intelligent shift, this means that & kmousetool as well; the surgery can not finish more through the lot of the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you use & kmousetool; under another window manager and a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click. this is the status of & kmousetool as well, and you can still work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter the text, tried & kmousetool as well as mouse click, and the cursor is mounted on a different place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to use the mouse on a neutral area of the mouse. the safe zones for the mouse poetic are & eg; the grey surfaces to the tool bar and menus and the front headlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent turn, but I made it not to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shift is an advanced function of & kmousetool as well as it needs to move into this way. if you want to move the mouse on the mouse button, but if you want to move the mouse for pressed mouse button. but there is likely to prepare for any problems here:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent shift, if you have just got to start my kmousetool as follows: click the mouse at the end of the text area and hold the conversion key, while you move the mouse-hand to the other end of the text, and once again the mouse buttoning.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. as a result, when & kmousetool as a click-off. so, you know, when the intelligent move begins. later, you can use the intelligent move, even without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool; it must be installed on the XTest extension for & X Window; this should be the case to be the case already.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool as soon as the mouse buttons soon progressing. this program was developed for people who suffer from RSI syndrome, and that the actuating the mouse buttons is gearing.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool as can be configured, that there is a certain period of time before the mouse starts before the mouse button is bound. in this way it can also be used to put the mouse and deposit with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filter are one of the advanced skills of & ktts; for the normal work with & ktts; filters are not needed.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In Filters it will be sent to text before he sent to the program for an extension. it is useful to replace the words or to replace a right language or to select a right language or to select a specific source of language synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the work of filters, it is important to know how the program "cable-hicher" works with a text. it distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The issue of Screen-Readern has the highest priority. it will be dragged to all other elements. if the issue of the screen reader is read, the required orders will be resumed again.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; the processor has precedence and holds the issue of messages and normal text. these orders will be resumed after the issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the following priority of normal text. & mouth mouth, an example for an application, the news is used. if you are looking for a long text, you can welcome you with & kmouth; someone welcome to the room. & KDE; alerts are also news. read this news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. every order to give you a text orders. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses the text orders. text orders are intended for the output of a text texts, which have no special derivatives.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in waiting-long, with the exception of the screen Screen Readers. if an application has the issue of a Screen Readers, while & ktts; just how to read, this issue will hold and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the issue of Screen-reducers. you will be applied to normal resource, news and text orders, as well as on & KDE; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and give it to the next filter. at present, there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, it can still be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Drawing parts of a text by other text. the parts can be used either as words or regular expressions, allowing the creation of chat emotions (as: -) by Text or for the reformatting of messages from & consenation; or & KMail; in a better shape form.</seg>

<seg id="2633">Depending on the content of the text, the text may be sent, depending on the box, and sent to a speaker. if you have, for example, if you have a female voice, you can read the text of KDE messages, you can read the text of KDE messages.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these various filter has adjustable rules, according to which he is applied for a voice guidance. if the filter is that its rules are not able to meet its rules and remains unchanged at the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text job, a message or a & KDE; notification in & ktts, it is sent by all activated filters which were built on the side down. the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2638">For the installation of strings set filters, you have to enter a list of words or regular intervals. this pattern is changed in the text, then the text is exchanged for the associated replacement text. big and small dish will not be replaced by comparison.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Specify a name for your filter a name. that name you can choose from anywhere in the name of the other filters, only by the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of the words of the words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with strings in the column, and replaced it in accordance with the string chain from the column. the list is used in the sequence from top to below.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>

<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & KDE is sufficient for this case, but also requires the development plan with libraries and for other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only experienced by experienced users. however, it's not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should help you.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about fundamental network technology are given, in the second, all of & knetworkconf; modified configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace more than IP networks. in this appendix we can only replace basic information about the integration of the PC in a small (home-home network).</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never been found. IPv6 is expected that it is in the near future. this description focuses on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to assign the knowledge that the IP address of a network interface is to be ordered. in any case, DHCP may not be used, your IP address can not be chosen from any case.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When using a own small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen from a address to the global (Internet) network to prevent IP address under the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by adjusting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks are usually used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the mask mask usually is set to 255.255.255.0, so that all computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own machine). the standard route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in local own machine. usually the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section, the configuration files are stored on & knetworkconf; they are affected and where they are stored in various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is dynamically changed when DSL connections has been dynamically modified, so there was no surprise if in case of active DSL connections, it is possible to find other contents as specified in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>

<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be used by & kdat; the can be done on three types:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; the band returns and reads the pre-out information of the band. recognizes & kdat; the band will not be requested on the tape, you will need to be formatted whether the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Automatically detects & kdat; if you are searching for the right index of your plate. cannot be found, if the band index will be newly created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything has gone smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive to show that the band has been incorporated. in the status bar, the content of the band can be searched for the band that can be searched for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before departure of the Bandes, the integration must be solved in the integration. there are three methods to apply this to apply.</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; there is a change of symbol for the band to detect the integration for the band and shows a corresponding announcement in the status bar. the band can now be subjected to a risk without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat; it can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">A belt card must be formatted before you can use the tape before you need to check out the tape before you have to be formatted before the tape before you're formatted. floppy band works usually need a shape of the band, DAT drives on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band called and the capacity, & kdat; with the format part of the band. all dates on the band is lost! after completion of the formatting process, the band is automatically adapted and is ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you need to select the secured files. this can happen to three types:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Choose a file or file in local file tree. it is backed by this file or the folder secured.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a key profile for tree in the tree. only the files are secured by the profile of the files.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Mark files in local file tree with a hamlets. only the selected files and / or subordner are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select the menu of Sichuan...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup was initiated, the dialog box for backup. in this dialogue, you can check the selected files and the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you have confirmed the settings to safeguarding the dialog box, the dialog box shows the progress of the backup process including data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Mark a file or a folder in one of the archives created for the drive. it will only be tested for the selected file or the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Mark the files in one of the archives on the band for the band with a hamlets. only the selected files and / or subordner are tested.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure was started, the dialog box for verification. in this dialogue you can check your selection and check the work regulations for the review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">When you confirmed the settings for the verification, the dialog test is checked out. this dialogue shows the progress of the test process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can open the files, the files must be restored, marked and marked. this can be carried out two types:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or file in one of the archives created for the tape drive. it will only be restored to the selected file or subordner.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Mark the desired files from one of the archives with a hamlets. it's only restored the files and / or subordner.</seg>

<seg id="2919">Once the re-run process started, the dialog box for recovery. in this dialogue you can check your selection and check the work folders for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">When you have confirmed the settings for restoration, the dialog box will appear. this dialogue shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes, it is necessary to create the band indexed file using the bandinhaltes. this procedure is used to create all existing index files for this band. you can create the index to two types of new band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">As a result, a reviewing profile is created with the just marked files and the default settings. you can customize for a critical profile for the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working hours, in which the backup is to be carried out. the list of the secured files will be automatically updated according to the just elected working work.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders, which are listed under the backup files, can be found on the same file system, such as the folder, which can be found on other filesystem, can be viewed separately on the backup files. each entry is independent of the files independent from the other.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform a incredentified backup. to verify that files are changed since the last incredit backup, a snake file is used. only the files are secured, which have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to ensure the changes of changes since the last incredit card.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Soldered the snail file against the command of tar. this causes that all files will be secured and a new snail file for the next backup is laid out.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons & gt;; and lt; if necessary, files was not implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can set up your menu item KDat menu in the menu of the menu. the following settings can be:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device storage for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path has to refer to the non-relics of the bandry.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the band works the command load to the drive. if some drives are necessary, before read or write operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, & kdat; the design of the tape drive is locked. possibly, this setting does not work in all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, the integration of & kdat; automatically the tape is done automatically. use this option to floppy drive.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Is the option to change & kdat; the hardwarsize block size for the tape drive is not necessary. no matter whether this setting is active or not you need to use & kdat; in any case the block size for your band works.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band-format, writes it a file to the start of the band. this file should only show a memory block on the band. the content of the file sets up as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">The tape-ID. the format of this string is bilname: seconds, the name of the complete name of the system is format on which the band was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds who have passed since the period have been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band-ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The other files on the band are pure tar-Archive that can directly manage directly with & GNU, allowing you to tar, even other tar versions should work, as long as it does not require incredit card.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a band is integrated.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog is a & KDE; viewing for system protocols. the program is intended for non-experienced users or where the system has the different protocol files. in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users with fast access to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users to understand what your computer in the background. is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of the own system. the program is suitable for experienced users who can't know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system has the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog has experienced users with quick access for example on their server. & ksystemlog is trying to provide some advanced functions, which can be filtered with the help of the protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog; a series of useful functions. among other things, among others:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of protocol files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included in the other chapters of this Handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screen photo, & ksystemlog; functions are available, with the help of the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily filters and sorted them in the next chapter of this Handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, & ksystemlog has been to open the system protocol, and it will not open a small news file, so you'll find & ksystemlog; the protocol files can be found under Linux in the folder / var / log, for the normal users don't have any authorization to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter the filter bar, which can be displayed automatically according to the selected filter. in the standard setting, the selection box is displayed on the filter. then a protocol line will only be displayed, if in one of the columns shall contain the drawing chain of the filter search engine.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry into the column of course. select the column in the protocol file system protocol, and you can also select the column in the filter bar, which shows you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent from this process or create.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting, and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. minutes lines of the stage are displayed with one eye-tested color as a protocol lines of the stage. the coloured representation of the protocol lines can be switched on.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Would you only want to display certain process (for example in the system protocol or in the cron protocol), for example, you can check the process identification (PID), for example, if you wish to examine the issue of a specific findings as for example the start of the Samba server. in this case you can use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can skip the option of new lines in the context menu of the main menu, to let all the new upcoming protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of several protocol files in separate windows. to open this function, use the entries in the window to open and manage your window onto the menu window as soon as you select a signature, select a protocol for the display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has an own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum software version .org. Dort you find additional information about the processing sources of & ksystemlog;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog is also found in the following folder of the & KDE; -Subversion Archives: ksystemlog; im & KDE; -Archives</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & KDE; System V Part Editor, rather known (and in the following) as & ksysv; this section is a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv; do you see.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V 2009 system develops rapidly to the standard for the control of the program at the end of the system in the & Linux; therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful and more flexible is more flexible than the traditional BSD style.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not continue to go on historical aspects (among others because I don't know anything else: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The hurt-binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is why because someone could try out a machine on the V-file, without a new installation and re-formatted file. that is why you need to be sure that the old hurdle is removed from there, if there was there.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Fort distinguishes itself from the BSD Init that the configuration files can be found in a subordner of / etc. this folder is called rc.d Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole amount of scripts. in principle you need a script for each system service. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things such as setring, which is only once again. such calls are to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local, if you need it. most systems have this file, even if it is not a lot of use. you can also create a rc.2 in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a bit more, what do you do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program init and starts the first that it finds it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runtime level is in / etc / inactivation. you should see in the starting range one line as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">On this point you can view a look at the second column you can change / etc / inittance of hand and you can change your needs. if you have something else if you're connected to changes, then you will need to start the system, restart the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how do it starts all the right scripts? if you enter the l-l-in rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder no proper files are here. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">As starts and stops in it, system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is so written that it's a argument such as start and stop. you can actually start this scripts on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would be the httpd server to keep it. init reads the name, and if the script will call it with the argument. if it includes an S, the script will be called by the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to set a simple way to create machines for many purposes. I could have httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc. in addition, I could also run a user-level level, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc;</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; you should not have very difficult because the program was made as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or any other hand tool is easy to say, not to say, make sure a entry from the area of availability system services to one of the six runtime in order to start him on this level (or stop to stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also change scripts between runtime or position within one level, by making it very different. this is the entry from its original run-level (or its position). this is not only if they draw an entry from the area of availability system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note that entries should be moved in a new area. to copy them in a new run-level, you need to select any copy from the menu, or in the target range, even if the same entry had already exists in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorption isable of a single order can not be calculated sometimes, in such a case you need to make the sorption values of the surrounding entries before you can try to put the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Please note: at the moment there is no possibility of entries that were thrown into the paper bag. so be careful not to be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator key to enable the various working areas (available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to meet a selection of Upper or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move one entry into another level level in order to move it into the intermediate level (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired runtime level (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the Sortierning or the name of an agreement manually, press the battery button to switch between different fields. join the dialog for the loading of the input -button to accept changes, or press Esc to curb the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the danger of data loss, all entries in the menu file require confirmation, before they will be executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are taken in the $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvc. default the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvc) are taken. otherwise they are restored by & ksysv; restored. changes to the preadjustments are stored in a local synosvc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runlevels, and now the machine is new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in individual user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittance and change the standard Runlevel on a reasonable value (3 should usually be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; it is intended to run under Runlevel X, but they will not be executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), then you have to edit extra files in / etc, which only need in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">This species, such as system services will be started to be simplified as system services in this distribution, but is unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; planning an extension to the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using any other distribution, please check whether all configuration files are required (and even if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) is not able to finish your configuration files not available or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux distribution level varies from distribution to distribution, if you use any other distribution, please send us any other distribution please send us about the runtime level, so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is based on & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter of & kuser; read more</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you have to save this. either use the respective icon of the tool bar or entry in the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser is an easy use. the main window is made up of two card cards, the user and the user troop-List. for editing, select the desired user or the desired group with double clicking on entry. it appears to be the dialog-user or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some box cards are only represented if you have extended system settings (Quota) for users, it will be added to individual settings; if you have individual box cards, if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master .passwd can be installed as BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The antitrust authority appears, if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master .passwd are installed as BSD -Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card appears only if a built-in order intake (Quota) is activated and initialized (can be seen on the file / user / quotas group). here you can changes every user parameters, whereby the space limits can be changed in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually adjusted for each file system. the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The map groups also informs about the group's group throughout the group. the default group is to be found in the primary group. the user can continue to become a member in the field of primary group. the user can mark the user in other groups by clicking this in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, mark this users on the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, add a user or group, or click on the right adding button of the tool bar. editing or soldering of the selected users or the selected group works analogous.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can remove the LILO BootManager, remove the boot-password, remove the time until the boats of the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove, remove, change operating systems, change and more.</seg>
