although I visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would live for the first time .
and that was very exciting .
my love to America is very large .
like many of my generation I grew up with American films , I have read American music , American authors and his sport .
in fact , this country had a great deep@@ ening effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican &apos;s student , with the help of Yu@@ Roberts , a oil magn@@ ets , who wanted to make his interest with judges with judges who wanted to make his interest .
I was caught .
free to Method Man , &quot; I was &quot; s , as if the absolute truth is , re@@ iss anything else , that &apos;s what I want to make with my life . &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , had only been intensi@@ fied for the USA .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I ever lived as welcoming , that you can always be able to find that you are and there is slightly acceptance in a community of equal people .
I even had a very sh@@ aking @-@ love letter over his size .
then , Donald Tru@@ mp came to Donald Tru@@ mp .
a lot has been written over the tourist interest and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of its climb is suitable for me , as he goes with his Eng@@ ines .
he holds out of his opinion behind the mountain , as you say so nice .
he tells the right of what he think , as a former colleague it spoke to him , and explained his interest for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro American and women .
nevertheless , the people still re@@ acts on his statements and for affili@@ ation for him .
the 13 million votes , which he won in the Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential election , was the highest number made by the party of nominated candidate .
I was in English .
who are Americans who wanted to support this kind person , I asked me ?
I could get Tru@@ mp and his vot@@ ers not work with people in line , which I had met during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , the people from all over the world , with whom I managed to talk about Islam and his past .
he also voted Tru@@ mps World Vic@@ tory of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present publisher of the &quot; Cinc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met us with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours so that &quot; Phoenix S@@ us &quot; had to play in the game .
Tru@@ mps in@@ tolerance stands also in contrast to the gener@@ osity , which I struggl@@ ed at Sandy B@@ ahr , who figh@@ ts for her life for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me as their son .
she still fit it to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es which , always with lots of pati@@ ence and sacrifice to me , and my colleagues helped us to get to the complexity of American life .
then , Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us , and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me with my career with my career .
these people and those who are em@@ bodied in their love by them in love with them .
while Tru@@ mp abandoned its way to the nominated republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that it was the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans spent over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of its debt to non @-@ white people .
the conflict with the idea that people had come for Tru@@ mp , because they shared either his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to see these things , me broke out almost the heart .
maybe it is un@@ fair the Tru@@ mp @-@ vot@@ ers as R@@ assi@@ sts .
people include the person , said one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation .
this is surface @-@ faced and resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who are on a different way and memory .
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fre@@ est over the h@@ ec@@ tic changes did not be taken into their municipalities .
could it be that these vot@@ ers , of which most know are , for Tru@@ mp , because she would like to win the control over a country that they dis@@ appointed it ?
in other words , they wanted to say that they are still important in that America ?
perhaps .
however , you can &apos;t forget to go to the words of David Rem@@ em@@ aking , who comments the cru@@ el decision to watch a man who look at home to those who look different .
these &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( p@@ m. ) . : as &quot; using the White against all other Eth@@ ics , &quot; word from white in detail on the White and whi@@ plas@@ h , which means how the big Van Jones called it , has made exactly what was about America so great .
the American ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - what faith or in the background you can always have any welcome .
because this country chosen as its President , twice the son of a Ken@@ i@@ an@@ ers , whose story , as he says , nowhere else , anywhere in the world would be possible .
however , with the election of Donald Tru@@ mps , however , there is a huge part of the white Americas . this promise to hell , freedom of religion and the whole term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in the America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back again on the rest of the rest .
in all I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the Father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of election .
on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , &quot; could have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the quantity responded with a quiet &quot; N@@ ein ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims defeated a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; brood for the quantity .
&quot; &quot; Lat@@ inos has a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they answered them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
have Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; No ! &quot; she finished and their voices were photographed .
if someone could not like you , one place in your America ? &quot;
he got a unanim@@ ous and quiet &quot; NE@@ IN ! &quot;
Mr. Khan finished his words : &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tru@@ mp , is not your Second World . &quot; 36 hours later he was rev@@ oked .
the country , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
that is now Tru@@ mps country , said the message .
and all people who look like Mr. Khan , could no more place in this new America .
and this breaks my heart .

from El@@ end to the stars : this Latin American children can not leave their love to music by the waste .

what has the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ an town of Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
that the music that has played at both locations , is not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music , which lives with waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , just 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; a old colonial city that is very popular among tourists , but Wor@@ lds removed from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous kitchen .
for several years now the La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Music ban@@ de ) has now been playing in the church : an old of children and adults of existing symph@@ onie Orchester , which has found their musical instruments to over@@ coming the surrounding poverty .
a music school with 100 students is become the central interest for the Municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the church , which is located in one of the po@@ o@@ rest provinces of Mexico , is known for their drugs and violence .
however , this changed this after a random meeting with a French pilot , a musical project started and the youth made a rare figure of hopes for youth .
the young band members take their obligations to the music group , the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
once they come from school , they go back home after lunch and immediately after lunch race they go through the dust streets to keep their large passion .
they always come and play with glossy eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel the day of trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clar@@ inet , O@@ bo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from the world
more than 7,000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero playing the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village which is virtually at the largest land@@ fill of As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital city - at instruments which are made of re@@ mod@@ ulated waste material :
music with re@@ prepared instruments which consist of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop dedicated to music instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling began using F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , to turn parts of the assignment in instruments .
the instruments i@@ mi@@ ze , vi@@ ola , c@@ elli , contra@@ b@@ asses , guitars , flute , trump@@ ets , trumpet , trumpet , trumpet and drums , all of which were produced from the waste .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ an and Latin American music as well as music by Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local oil ologist and a teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura :
first it was very difficult because we had no space for samples and we had to do at the same place where the parents had no music , and it was very difficult to contact their parents , because many of them are living with their children .
that changed when the F@@ avi@@ o has slightly shown that he had never seen : one of the most produced violin .
today there is a full orchestra that plays every kind of instruments and this is the Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic land@@ fill ) distinguishes the musical output to :
the world generates about one billion tonnes of the world every year .
those who live with him and of him are the sleeves - as people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something Schön@@ es .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic , the Orchestra follows the orchestra with his inspiring spect@@ acle from the waste @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra gave his music even before Pope Francis :
this eastern African countries show how technology and team@@ work have been successfully able to fight the illegal fishing countries
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that struggl@@ es with wild illegal fishing .
this entry , written by Emma Br@@ y@@ ce , was originally published in En@@ si@@ a@@ .com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ release occurs in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices on common use of contents .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated in li@@ beri@@ zed waters of illegal fishing , before it sought the other coast of Africa .
according to the Eastern African countries , the East African countries were over and little inclined to welcome the law of this kind to their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the com@@ ors , Mos@@ ambique , and the Seychelles include a rapid against the ship . you don &apos;t miss it to divide one of her har@@ vest@@ ments , and to divide it to him .
suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries who is simply changing everything , &quot; recalls the Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior executive of the ken@@ ian fish@@ eries . he is part of a team that discovered the ship of a time .
in 2013 , the ship was exp@@ elled out of the waters of the region : it was not succeeded to catch fish there .
finally , it was obliged to pay $ 2 million to Liberia , because of pl@@ ot@@ ation of the country &apos;s stocks .
the nucle@@ us of this initiative , criminal cases and resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Hotel ( Il@@ legal al fishing ) .
the members of this network are besides Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries , who had their waters in their waters .
we have eight countries , which are listed and are working together . they know about illegal fishing . &quot; he says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable project En@@ ding Il@@ legal 1 . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is linked to definition : what is caught , is hidden because of it extremely difficult . this , illegal fishing is a major cause of fish@@ eries from regions .
by the deliber@@ ate abuse of existing laws , which shall be protected by certain living rooms and types , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystem damage , which have a deli@@ ble balance .
but while campaigns against illegal fishing will be disabled by bureau@@ cratic hur@@ dle through bureau@@ cratic hur@@ dle and the information between individual countries , such as the actions in real@@ time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there may be the individual countries with each other , for example lists of existing licenses , news , and details that could be noticed during a port at the port of a port .
fish @-@ i has pursued the activities of ships also very attention when they move on an open lake , with satellite end@@ ship .
this makes it possible to character@@ ize the authorities to do ships , which are coming into banned areas . also , for example , to indicate that a ship invites his dead fish on other ships on other ships .
in the ide@@ als , such studies show whether the participating ships have a fish pond license , where they were travelling and possibly , whether they have a stra@@ w@@ gi@@ ster .
countries that are on the basis of these ships , are based on the basis of these ships in their ports . what means that the ships can not sell their charge in their ports . and that they could be forced to do the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of Premier .
then , a significant financial losses for the owner , meaning that the illegal fish is to be financi@@ ally worth@@ while .
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company that supports illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already called platform was created to gain more than 20 million dollars to lost sales , which will lose eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year because of illegal fishermen who are penet@@ rate in East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive Th@@ un@@ fish oil paintings , so due to the region of commercial fish shops in the whole world . however , the illegal fisher@@ man .
among other things , the actions include the sail of fal@@ low flag , revolution@@ ized licensing , specification of imag@@ ined species , the fish protected species and fish in nature .
they take advantage of the missing international cooperation , and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ organized control system , &quot; says long . &quot; earlier , a ship was illegal and a country could not go to the port of my port . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Kom@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this leg@@ ale gor@@ ges are to close to F@@ ISH @-@ i .
so far , the closed front .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspected ships .
it has been exposed to criminal networks to spread the number of licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships in which the number of frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has been persec@@ uted and found ships .
due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority in control of crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over long distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us rather far to the networks organised crime &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
he is building a system that will help the F@@ ISH @-@ i to help you more precise ships .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always developed further , helps illegal ships to hide the illegal ships .
illegal Fischer use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; he says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , head of Tr@@ y@@ gg Mat Tra@@ cking , an N@@ RO , which also deals with fish@@ eries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support .
some of the ships switch to the example their automatic identification systems , which they can &apos;t be used anymore by satellite .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that combines various information on each other . it should help you find F@@ ISH @-@ i help in criminal ships with larger precision .
a model program
yet , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team African nations actually influence the no global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth .
recently , Sky@@ Truth together with Google and the Marine protection organization Oce@@ ana opens the platform Global Business Watch : a platform that offers satellite end@@ ship and can be displayed by means of each individual tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide .
with the neigh@@ bors who want to get a better picture of what what does it - this is simply sense , &quot; he says . &quot; here is a chance for countries to combine and to join her resources for the study .
we should do this on a global level . &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project , where a global system allows persecution of ships .
there is no evidence that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only have a criminal sense , but they also cast them .
ships who had previously been conf@@ is@@ cated without license and hardly had to be reck@@ oned with consequences , know that they will be observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the interest in F@@ ISH @-@ i participating countries , a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries , has been selling more licenses ever since .
once F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped in Gre@@ ko 1 , the Insp@@ ectors found there on board tow@@ ing network , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries will notice this success . &quot; the effect is strong that us now has to copy other countries , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; we will disappear here one hundred million dollars by illegal fishing .
there are six countries participating in the 2015 West Africa Task Force . also , it can tackle illegal fishing , after exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . . &quot; security is the goal to be even more such initiatives and structures also in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s younger member in Somalia made its first major triumph : in October , Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was on the road . not only the ship has been on the road and not only used a license and tow@@ ing tow@@ ing that are prohibited .
the ship was also covered in dry waters that are reserved for fisher@@ man from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; with a score against Gre@@ ko 1 , &quot; a strong sign that they go for illegal fish @-@ cat@@ cher &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for F@@ ISH @-@ i is a further success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a particular , collaborative work is actually work throughout the world . Emma Br@@ y@@ ce is freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes on the environment , technology and nutrition .
their article appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , T@@ ed Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . location in Venezuela came up further : demonstrations in several cities with the aim to conquer &quot; the country . &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a shaft of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

especially big waves struck the message about pol@@ ishing suppression in the centrally located town of Marac@@ ay .
there , demonstr@@ ators moved into the local cathedral in order to protect the government in order to protect the government and armed forces from the government .
later they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went on .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to keep the police forces , including these wife in the An@@ den@@ staat T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :

meanwhile , meanwhile , this makes a inf@@ ogra@@ ms the turn , which forms the extent of suppression of suppression a day :

the interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced from his father to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian town of Cór@@ doba .
as the adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano said now in the frame of the great La Per@@ la Ribera process in the province of Cordoba against his father .
the crimes committed during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship began on 24 August 2016 .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not left its lives .
starting in the Bür@@ de , the same name as his father carry back up to the brutal military factory in prison in La Per@@ la , which he observed in the age of 15 , he has sufficient enough .
he held the family secret secret for 34 years .
in the situation , I believed that I was in order to order .
I felt like a secret magic .
as a child with 15 years you notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I didn &apos;t know that my father was a di@@ eb , torture and mort@@ ar .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ an officer . during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship , was his father from 1976 to 1978 , was a deputy commander of the intelligence department 141 in prison in La Per@@ la prison .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the under@@ stand@@ alone , which is charged with ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who was born over the years , recognized as a boy who had experienced the boy , and who said before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power shows a parent about his child , and as this child was chosen for a way of rede@@ mption .
from the Sports Hall to the military base
when my father started to use me for a military base , I went often to the sports hall . I made me with a young man , the mar@@ tial arts .
all the mentioned him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he revealed me a black white photo and called me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are a Ar@@ sch@@ loch , you have completed you with one of the ERP .
pass merely to say that they do not lead you a day , and I have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revolutionary Gu@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - revolution@@ aries &apos;s Army - the military arm of revolutionary workers in Argentina .
therefore he for@@ ba@@ de to go to the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he said to me , I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought would be in order . for example , my Father had moved me .
on the military base , I had to destroy , and had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university ports , handwritten notes , Liter@@ ature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simple everything .
photo : Com@@ isi@@ ón Provin@@ cial de la Mem@@ oria
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
my father took me a total of four times after La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
during the first and last time he left me at the entrance of the car .
when he took me the second time , he was able to change to me . he led me to a bar@@ b@@ acke , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just everything far .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little in a ceiling when turned to me , it was to wear a car . when I opened it , I saw that it was a large cl@@ um@@ ps silver .
on this day , I went to the other end of the Bar@@ acke , where the stolen were taken and conducted me with a w@@ po@@ sten .
suddenly he has made a open space and said :
the prisoners is tor@@ tured .
I sp@@ lash in and saw a couch that were tor@@ tured on the people .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found that they attached to an end to a cable . the other end was fixed at the body of the person , which was just removed there .
they have a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on bed , shot him with water and hunt for a charge of 220 volts in the gen@@ italia .
photo : Com@@ isi@@ ón Provin@@ cial de la Mem@@ oria
the rocks there was there to be a bit ... like a dirty Win@@ del as a dirty Win@@ del .
in later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I realized the smell immediately and I was clear that the smell of a body in Not is .
I never forget this smell never forget .
and I asked me : how is it possible to do that man can do any other so much cor@@ d ?
&apos; I knew what these people were killed &apos;
when my father worked for the third time in the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the cap@@ tives merged with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were examined .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilians who was also charged in trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a series of matt@@ resses , on which bare people with the face down to bottom - all were filled with hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance to the matt@@ resses , people caught up to the matt@@ resses .
when my Father noted that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; What gu@@ me du so , Ar@@ sch@@ loch ? &quot;
I &apos;m afraid , &quot; Why you have brought me otherwise ? &quot;
I knew what people were killed .
they were killed and buried in a pit , and buried by soldiers .
I know that , because my father told us at home .
in addition to La cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms which were named as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito , &quot; Rom@@ ero &quot; went into a man and killed , and killed .
according to the survivors of the civilian population is Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indicted in the La Per@@ la Ribera trial , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina .

if you see on the card , you see that they were about this way , and then tor@@ tured to the first time .
here their name changed and they were assigned as part of the trial of the human being a number .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the arrangement of above came , they should be moved to them .
this was the lie - the Euph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War Crimes &apos;
my father brought all possible things to begin with home .
back then , at that time I had no idea about what the &quot; war against &quot; - as it was called .
but when I was later to the military , I was in the G@@ endar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear that war against a Baj@@ on@@ ett or perhaps military sign that man figh@@ ts to fight .

but if one comes in a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothing , paintings , money ... sti@@ cky , then this is no war against but V@@ and@@ alism .
it is the@@ ft .
I always asked myself , how my father , the head of security forces , could participate in the V@@ and@@ alism .
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in the G@@ endar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have noticed , into a house into a house and everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do it .
once called he called me a crimin@@ als , and I answered , and thou shalt go to the road cars on the street ?
you are no det@@ ective ?
he explo@@ ded me against W@@ ut , struck me and cried :
if you get so far , I will find thee and bring thee .
don &apos;t need any other !
my father was my father .
I have not only a good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I revealed a photo from then , on which I had a jacket and a escal@@ ator . both of them had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he brought clothing at home .
back then , the defense of defence was allowed to have a co @-@ liter@@ al during this crime . I did not resist any problem that they wanted to go to the load of what they wanted to do .
I was so@@ oner why I was to appeal .
&apos; the disappearance of Lei@@ che is the last ab@@ sc@@ anned act .
now , where I am older , I have Reu@@ e .
I have children . if you have only once children , one sees the value of a life .
it is continued to continue and recognizes that it is wrong , too .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have been ex@@ er@@ ted during the dictatorship people . but the bodies will disappear ?
why children &apos;s lead ?
one day , my father brought a girl who had been killed by his mother , his mother had been killed .
it was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always had the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why they were killed ?
they could simply bring it to prison , but you can simply bring it to prison .
I guess , it was simply decided to kill these people . but , to make their dead bodies ?
these people do not have families to have been handed over to their ster@@ ity ?
the disappearance , the bodies of the bodies is the last ab@@ sc@@ anned act , which can do one person .
my father told me when the democracy was re @-@ launched , hol@@ ed them , to eliminate the remains of the prisoners .
they were broken and somewhere somewhere - no idea , where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but anything like this remains of course .
I have seen how you have killed people ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I even had even at G@@ endar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just make the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the thought to show my father , was born during a meeting when he stood under house arrest .
I made him to work with him because of all the things that I had to experience .
then he suddenly appeared : &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have killed ni@@ em@@ anden . &quot;
I felt back in the inner part , and asked me to keep all the over@@ haul Patri@@ oti@@ ent and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; which they had announced it .
then send me :
to me ?
I have seen how you have killed people !
you have terrible crimes committed and thou hast led me as a kid .
he joined me only &quot; Na @-@ g me . &quot;
this was exactly what did I did .
in 2010 , I ref@@ itted the first display .
I finally knew that he was a war .
no one cannot wait for me , that I am default . I finally said to my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest standing before the end of the trial .
he was indicted for 4@@ 16 criminal charges : among them he@@ aw@@ ns , torture in 154 cases , torture in 154 cases , torture and subsequent death sequence in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year old child .

the sign with the translation error in a center in K@@ YO@@ TO , where you can extend his license .
the photo was widespread in the social media .

in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers were able to extend a newly @-@ opened center in which you can extend his license , the last month &apos;s witnesses of a whole especially mis@@ fortune .
on a sign , the Japanese word ap@@ eri@@ zation . &quot; ( ko@@ fi@@ er@@ sh@@ a ) , the &quot; older driver &quot; means , but maybe even with Bö@@ tt@@ ings thank You , and # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; fur@@ ry driver &quot;
the wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September to electronic ads in the input area and in the building itself .
process of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was shared into the social media .
the error was the trans@@ lat@@ ors of Julian Hol@@ mes , a population of Ky@@ ot@@ os , and it was also aware of the local time for the local time .
the following in Kyoto &apos;s daily K@@ YO@@ m@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it could come to an English translation ?
this demonstrates that no one has read the translation .
this is a reward of elderly people and in an international city such as K@@ YO@@ U &apos;s simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes .
the incorrect English translation was first removed . the name &quot; other drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; fur@@ ry driver &quot; ) was replaced later by the appropriate &quot; fields &quot; ( German : &quot; older driver &quot; ) was replaced by the appropriate driver &quot; ( German : &quot; older driver &quot; ) .
the police in the Kyoto Protocol has occurred for the translation errors . furthermore , it declared that the error was already in the text , they had not been checked by the translator , and that the translation was not published on their judges before it was published .
a B@@ logger reported as follows :
&quot; &quot; it &apos;s correctly that older people suffer by the inadequate correction ( the translation ) our part , &quot; said the police .
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News won a slightly detailed phenomenon of the &quot; fur@@ ry &quot; elder &quot; in Japan apart and wrote :
the word &quot; ven@@ e@@ bar &quot; was re@@ sum@@ ed as a reasonable description of the following driver . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are involved , but the reason is to worry about .
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for example , 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by the same period in 2005 . this corresponds to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , the sen@@ iors 1.@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
its share increased to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents had declined in total , the percentage of elderly people have risen to the same period in the same period .
the association non @-@ called re@@ por@@ ters brought to Yahoo published version of article comments of the light , which demonstrate what predic@@ ts are some Japanese apparently against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo above the translation errors received the following comments :
- &quot; Is the ( &quot; fur@@ ry driver &quot; ) about reality ? &quot;
- &quot; so incorrect , the translation is actually even not , or ? &quot;
I don &apos;t know that this is a real translation errors . &quot;
there are not a few comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is widespread in the whole of Asia .
translation errors have been widely used in Japan and very Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true place for these bizar@@ re mistakes in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation were varied .
for example , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the output text and active language skills to transfer him into the target language .
the latter requires the active Beh@@ y of the target language - something that is the case in the speakers in the case . generally , the conviction is the conviction that a translator was in the target language - not in the initial language - speakers .
for example , a French native speakers for example from the English to French French - not by French in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
many Japanese company employ a number of Japanese companies in English as a native language , which may cause translations to English into English . this is a lack of understanding for the over@@ pass , cost @-@ rün@@ de or the relatively small number of English speakers , Japanese learning .
some companies who have no foreign staff , let me do not change their men@@ tions . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is the best one to be a translator . no matter how well or bad his language are really good .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the fact that these technology can be revealed by mechanical translations , show that these technology has no longer replace a human trans@@ lat@@ ors . this applies to some languages quite well .
some of the strange English formulation in Japan , including the t@@ sel@@ ing prints , often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only from style reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors like jewel@@ s are still acceptable or at least a harm@@ less . but by major companies or from the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards , you can expect more effectively .

Venezuela : protests and security measures on the Internet and Television take part in the Internet and Television
main page of the Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Frei@@ &apos;s Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institute of Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , a session of the Venezuel@@ an internet user account that they had no access to the online transmitters Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , others wrote others , that the internet news release of VP@@ I@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV are not available to be accessible .
other online channels also contributed to the protests in Carac@@ as , which were organised by op@@ position@@ ist groups which the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros are resist@@ ed .
the protests began in the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the duties of the parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tra@@ cer@@ out@@ es . he pointed out that the connection is associated with Us@@ ers , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Z@@ ensor r : disabled your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages Venezuel@@ an providers are again locked .
this is by the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been approved since 2014 in the reporting on protests . at that time , the Commission threatened with money terms and closure , if they continue to report on demonstrations , since the Commission saw it as a call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and inform@@ ational national television channels I discovered me again with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this is still cheaper than you buy two liters of Lim@@ onade .
the local NGO yo@@ ungst@@ ers confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was un@@ accessible by a sper@@ on the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two more online channels . this also affects the link between the National Assembly its meetings .
earlier research findings of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , that the local internet provider can use to access the DNS provider . this is a technique into force by the DNS Server qu@@ eries of certain domains .
if an site is blocked by the DNS Server , the server is incorrect , or ref@@ uses the request for the call of such a website .
we confirm a DNS sper@@ re : @ el@@ y@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ VP@@ I@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at VP@@ I@@ TV , a third @-@ per@@ ed channel , set the transfer on Thursday , April 6th , when the VP@@ I@@ TV camera El@@ vis Flo@@ res , who was over@@ taken the protests in Carac@@ as .
Flo@@ res was beaten in , while he was a police in police .
eight hours later he was released , and VP@@ I@@ TV was released on the shipment .
although some channels still be accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government &apos;s internet connections have been regulated , so that the Veneti@@ z@@ ol@@ ers will continue to have access to multi@@ media coverage in the country .
in Paraguay many girls will become a slave to get a training .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visited the house where they worked for years .
today Tina was struggl@@ ing for the rights of children and collects stuff other Cri@@ me , exactly as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report by Kur@@ ds , the Global Vo@@ ices , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying Kü@@ he , presi@@ ded schools &quot; ) , edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in an household where they did not work together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her degree at the University , she returned to the university , and heard it once again to her house , as the owner of the house full of pride , she said , &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
the , that has become a little , &quot; said it . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated as a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as cri@@ ad@@ ita to work for the family . as cri@@ mp@@ itas in Paraguay , the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work for the school .
the business is very simple : a big family with little money transfer their old son or her min@@ der@@ m daughter to another , sub@@ missions . in T@@ ausch receives the child , a training and a roof over the head .
however , what should not be mentioned , that the children must be paid for countless days of domestic work , which will never be paid and sacrifice by abuse of abuse and missions in the framework of a treaty which you can &apos;t get .
this practice is called cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go in Paraguay with the participation and acceptance by large parts of the company and in spite of numerous complaints of human rights organizations .
after finishing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked a few years for an organization dedicated to the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke with cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - and raised their testimony to the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
you tried to call the things for the name , because the feeling of gr@@ atitude in which the cri@@ mination of the cri@@ mp@@ se is vacc@@ inated , guaranteed in general .
the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double tone , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
since the one hand , the family , who have their daughter in faith , that they do so as their training to improve their position in society , and &quot; something out of itself , &quot; to another family .
on the other side , the family stands the girl with the faith and exploitation with the faith , that they would give you a chance to get there , otherwise no education would be and perhaps be forgotten .
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is har@@ assed , his family will learn many years later .
they even experienced it even never of them .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown known phenomenon occurs in the bor@@ rowing in par@@ agu@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín , in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú came to hospital , her body showed a serious stro@@ kes . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
it was cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military partner Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who worked as a lawyer at the population .
Mar@@ ín lived in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
by the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira was struck as long as long as with a floor on Mar@@ ín , until it suffered a dead@@ ly injuries .
this should be the last ir@@ radiation in the life of the young girl .
some days later , the media reported on the incident .
they were stressed that the child was a cri@@ ad@@ ita in Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organisations such as UNICEF and Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep into the par@@ agu@@ an Society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go in practice for the death of the girl .
they recorded the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of sla@@ very . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest , together and required that there are no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
in Paraguay more cows are registered as children in Paraguay , Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents , it is very difficult to control , under what conditions is boys and girls .
the neigh@@ bors of the Eh@@ a@@ ars and almost 60 civil society organizations have demanded an inqu@@ iry into the case .
they want , Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years in prison .
when the case before court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín trend could be in@@ definitely - if the first time in the history , the case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is a case before the court .
the daily life of Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only exploited as a workforce , they are living isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when Far@@ bi@@ k who worked in her father , Con@@ course , and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to go all work and began to sell on the road or on the market , to earn money .
they went all further to the school .
only Tina was sent by cri@@ ad@@ ita in the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of their employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
at this time , they had to divide the time so that their time remained in learning through learning .
they stood at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
Fri@@ days , for example , they cle@@ ans@@ ed the fridge , p@@ utz@@ te the living room , polished furniture and the infected floor .
when school was at the end , she went back home again , and had time to learning .
ever it was finished with learning , the more leisure time had it .
however , this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says that she had never had to be star@@ ved , but did not have not limited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up books from the library of the house@@ wife as food from the refrigerator . &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the house@@ wife , an old military and sympath@@ y of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a Liber@@ al party , which was held during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was part of the opposition from 1954 to 1989 .
in addition to him , &quot; Sen@@ dero , &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; could be read on some evenings of the households &apos; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
in fact , he tried to convince them to convince the reports of the official media about the regime of the dict@@ ator .
he held them for intelligent , but didn &apos;t want to meet someone with her . &quot; the house@@ keeper had found someone who heard it , while he spoke , &quot; says she says . &quot;
they were not often to visit my family , because she was the opinion that I would go there again . &quot; I said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indi@@ ces of the Guar@@ an@@ í group , was to speak at home again in Guar@@ an@@ í .
their lord , fear@@ ed that they had their formation , which they had to lose it , explains it again .
it was however completely clear that they had paid for everything that they had paid for them , with their hard work .
also in school was Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a discre@@ et . &quot; an article about which is never been spoken , Mo@@ b@@ bing and the sl@@ ot@@ es are exposed if they are exposed to school .
because the other children have their parents have immediately , recognize that someone who has no parents who has no parents , a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I was able to invite home to me home . I had no fre@@ undes@@ kreis in school or neighborhood next to me .
in my youth , at the time where friends will arise , I feel very clearly that I belonged to no group .
the isolation was the worst from all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the society is cheap to the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where we can share their experiences for cleaning agents and children &apos;s ma@@ ids in Paraguay .
the administration of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city council in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small haz@@ ards for my small daughter , who plays in the morning and afternoon with her .

please click here .
start from Monday , if possible .
the ad was five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the Ath@@ em@@ by wrote that they would have had a el@@ f@@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; you like small children and is very beautiful , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
in the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the country to work in the third comment . &quot;
then the author of the advertisement still is once again :
dear friends , I have found one found . I am sure if it works with her .
many thanks , I write back again , if something is something .
the shop was completed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ on report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( cri@@ ad@@ itas , as long as long ? ) , a collection of stuff from former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ note :
in the course of our history , we made it into account that the Spanish con@@ gresses took place in the Spanish era , where he was not willing to prove that many girls and boys were willing to establish that many girls and boys are going to be found in a system of sla@@ very , where they are light victim for abuse of abuse and exploitation .
the social im@@ plant in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to understanding the phenomena of the phenomena are known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
the bill was writing by Egyptian users of social media in order to register the government in the government .

sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections recently ordered a legislative face to &quot; regulatory appro@@ vals regarding the use of the use of social networks . &quot;
when he is accepted by Parliament , user players need to register social media in Egypt with a government authorities to register social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law , then a place is set up , which is responsible for citizens , citizens and citizens can use a permission to share social media .
within six months of assumption of the law , users would have to use user players on the site with their correct name and personnel numbers to register social networks .
if this is to do this , the remainder of up to six months was sentenced to six months in prison or a money release .
the draft bill that consists of six par@@ agra@@ phs and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defined social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that runs via the Internet and used to communicate with other by voice , video and text . &quot;
it is unc@@ le@@ ar how the law is thought there is no indication of the law , such as those who must pay attention , that the Egyptian government does not have to register that the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary group and promotion of the Legislative Decree , the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user players and users received a password in order to come up by a fire@@ wall and a password . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to en@@ dur@@ e a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . because of which would be necessary for Egyptians for Egyptians and Egyptians may be necessary to access the network to access the network .
but it is so far not known that these plans consist of these plans .
experts and experts prior to site are sk@@ ep@@ tically regarding the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the procedure .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research T@@ echnolog@@ ical Research ( &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , &quot; German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , &quot; says Global Vo@@ ices :
I bi@@ ked strongly on the technical capacities and the understanding for any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion it was so important that , just as they could be understood by a physical public and private rooms , they could also be done online .
if I understand it , then this means that they are a powerful surveillance system to apply citizens , which are a permission , or not . , and this means a w@@ ack@@ y system to monitor the activity of the people , and also to perform a court process .
this is a great way of realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be passed as a law , the draft must be discussed under the legislative Parliament and the Constitutional Treaty , before it goes into the plenary of the Parliament .
if its assumption is successful , or not , the design &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military thinking in parliament in which the control is maxi@@ mi@@ zed and be guaranteed to be present that no different sc@@ ep@@ ration of nar@@ ration on the image area is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
in the past year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y ordered an amendment to Cy@@ ber @-@ Cri@@ me , who was found guilty of life imprisonment for those who was found guilty , that &quot; public order will be found guilty , and to protest the &quot; public order . &quot;

high above in the mountains of Kurdistan is working in the northeast of Iraqi , the Shel@@ ter H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and their team of scientists at the non @-@ governmental organisation in Nature in the northeast of Iraqi citizens .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of Leop@@ ards which are caused by Africa and Asia , including the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and fragments of their life period and since they are dangerous .
why is this specific type of Leop@@ ards so important ?
as R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; The Persian Leopard is the only remaining days in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the car@@ es of ecos@@ ystems also depends on that a large smo@@ kers present is available .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s progress began to re@@ build the life in the past six years . an enormous earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had the disaster .
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai the Pre@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture was a fine pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan northeast , both to experience the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iw@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had disappear from the city map .
still in the pre@@ fecture Fu@@ kus@@ hima a atomic accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the Special Annual Report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o will be achieved from local view over six years to re@@ build the life of local @-@ based local .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authorities as well as pol@@ l results of the person affected themselves .
the housing facility in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses are being held in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ations by December 2015 .
in the largest success , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a period of 80 percent of the planned spare parts were finished , here , 80 percent of the planned spare parts were finished .
Iw@@ ate has finished 75 percent of such houses , while the Fu@@ kus@@ hima still forms the final light with 70 percent .
even six years after the cat@@ astrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated from Beh@@ el@@ ter ( hi@@ ves , Cau@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the final replacement houses .
after the triple @-@ cat@@ astrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in Beh@@ avi@@ or .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iw@@ ate lived in such areas .
nearly 40 per cent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still living in emergency , whereas more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation was ev@@ acu@@ ated and moved to the Des@@ aster in Beh@@ el@@ ter and moved into final houses .
for Iw@@ ate , the number here is 34 percent .
the work of the work and everyday life in the three affected f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 children of 1100 schools were affected by the bad , its gates will be opened up until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of schools in three f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three f@@ ec@@ tures was much more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of the fish@@ eries in Iw@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back in operation , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of the fish@@ eries were re@@ sum@@ ed their operation .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have moved into the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land in the area .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of his agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in Iw@@ ate and less than 50 % destroyed ar@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is un@@ likely that only a result of nuclear war@@ med is , because 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land @-@ destroyed ar@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima are found in the &quot; nuclear @-@ nuclear zone . &quot;
in two of the three f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has re@@ marked the tourism reaching back again , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ate are again to 90 percent at the same stand , as before the bad . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , however , can only have 75 percent here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Zeitung reports that since the cat@@ astrophe is almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it &apos;s more difficult to earn her life .
is the native population to the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine a overall picture , the newspaper resulted in numerous issues among the local people and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation . she asked them about the status of re@@ building and also , as you can find themselves at the ts@@ un@@ ami &apos;s risk .
in the introduction of the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey through to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population .
the survey showed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the site @-@ based inhabitants , measures to be infl@@ ated to future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ amis .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 per cent of respon@@ dents said that it was not enough enough for cat@@ astroph@@ es prevention .
as it is around those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima ev@@ ev@@ ac@@ ev@@ ac@@ ev@@ ac@@ ev@@ ac@@ ev@@ ac@@ ev@@ ac@@ ev@@ ac@@ ev@@ ac@@ ev@@ ac@@ ev@@ ac@@ uation .
in her issue for the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung gave its attention to the location of ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima did not only experience the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Pre@@ kus@@ hima did get witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ ance , ato@@ mi@@ zing , who had to experience Japan each .
nearly 63 000 people were ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima . almost 63 000 people were transferred in the areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were something more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima . they have been converted to Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
after the stand of 2017 , more than 40 000 inhabitants live from Fu@@ kus@@ hima off their home Pre@@ fecture .
most of the ev@@ acu@@ ities , most of the ev@@ acu@@ ities , is still over 50 years old . they have to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Iw@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima . here , it is a construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games , which will be held in Tokyo .
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when man &apos;s people from other countries met another language , the differences seem to be larger than the common things .
after a while , however , one can recognize that there seems to be more than it seems at the first glance .
these global connections are important to challenge our perspectives for our perspectives and us recall that the world finally gave it very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , let us treat this global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we treat the topics related to coverage less attention than they earn less attention .
we &apos;re talking to five Global Vo@@ ices members who are interested in a moment in which they are very strongly connected to meet someone with speech and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa speaks about the time that she worked with people from all over the world . and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b is back on his experiences that he gathered in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the Inten@@ sive station : last Friday , a police officer took part in G@@ oi@@ â@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nationwide nationwide tot@@ alled millions of protest@@ ers in a protest against spar@@ ed .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the federal state of G@@ oi@@ ás , has suffered a sk@@ ull @-@ mil@@ n grape trau@@ ma and several frames .
doctors have operated this Saturday and have been sent him into an artificial dresser .
his condition is critical as a critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus which spread over a couple of days quickly in Brazil .
on the pictures , the face of the police officer is recogni@@ zable , who was identified with a drummer attack . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian federal state of G@@ oi@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the conclusion of the incident of the active service .
the pictures show the police officer such as he in G@@ oi@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
would be a police officer from a demonstr@@ ators and in the Inten@@ sive station , his face would be able to see six months in television and the entire suppression would be justified .
the &quot; Des@@ p@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel by media activists from G@@ oi@@ â@@ nia , recorded video in the network in which one sees how Mat@@ eus from the police officers are attacked and several sanitary shortly afterwards .
another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective , is also filmed in social networks .
in the below shown clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50 second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , has now been donated to the 10.000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to meet a part of the cost for medical treatment and to stay in G@@ oi@@ â@@ nia , while it lies in the hospital .

G@@ oi@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , in which it arrived in the last Friday of the police against protest@@ ers .

the members of the Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via speakers through violence against protest@@ ers .
this is also a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media street pro@@ w@@ ren@@ ches once again have the focus on another , un@@ expected prot@@ agonists - a window disc .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically targeted about a bro@@ kers glass window to shape with a photo on the front pages .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a set of fire .
there is no pl@@ ung@@ ed journ@@ alistic articles , more about a broken window display than the protests of the most popular people who serve the defense of a special thing .
this must also be seen even if man is stri@@ ped to any form of non@@ damaged damage .
the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism is &quot; a absur@@ d &quot; for absur@@ d , and the typical violence of the military police are entitled to the head@@ lines with the title &quot; protest@@ ers on the fron@@ tal course with the police . &quot;
the villages of Cuba in Cuba
with the introduction of the Law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso was formed by almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ ali@@ ch , who is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - known that there is no n@@ enn@@ ines of sugar cane on site .
it is two years later than the activities in the sugar cane factories were laid down .
after creating the sugar pipe industry in the region , and the factory lost to and from its plants , until only the rum@@ ors had remained in steel and concrete .
in total , about 272 workers had to be re @-@ found .
some inter@@ actions the work .
other re@@ signed and pen@@ ile daily among the factories that &apos;s even ma@@ stered .
N@@ ene , a solo veter@@ an , who stands every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar tube industry is not smoking his sleep .
he heard that it was in the east of the sugar pipe factories , which are back in operation again after long time , because they were preserved .
that was something unexpected .
N@@ ene is reminiscent of having heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ ali@@ ch the sugar tube factory would not be kept , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar pipe industry is already in pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prizes , the I@@ ne@@ ff@@ ness , the bad administrative decision and climate change .
in 2016 , production of 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced a lot .
the message would have been some decades ago a motif for the country , but the bad proportions are no longer than new@@ ness .
why , the Cuban sugar tube industry has been selected ?
the old railway station saw already better times at the age of better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the size of the sugar pipe industry was a economic necessity : the 155 sugar pipe factories were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and barely competitive , they were un@@ portable for the country .
the initial idea was to focus on the most efficient factories that annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories that could produce sugar for the most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motifs , which led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar tube plant@@ ations and the access crisis on the global market .
nevertheless the sugar prize rose to about one decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pounds , according to the 2016 &quot; Land@@ wirtschaft@@ skammer &quot; by OECD and FAO , the Agricultural and Health Organization of the United Nations .
if the current production volume of 2001 would reach ( 3.6 million tons ) , the raw storage capacity would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
didn &apos;t everything ran good
today , &quot; today &apos;s day , with safety in history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President Fi@@ del Castro , during his speech on October 21 , 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
from the process of restructuring in the sugar industry , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the de@@ formation of a total of 98 sugar pipe factories , more than 65 million people received its full advantage for advanced training .
the same thing happened in the sugar tube factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ ali@@ ch on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez , worked in the factory since 1967 , has been working in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , is the word that he is most repeated , &quot; Bet@@ ter . &quot;
almost all those ques@@ tioned are the same opinion : not one of them became informed that the factory would be shut down .
for this , they will receive a full time - working group .
before the first quarter of the year , the first letters began to come .
it was about official documents about documents that are removed only regarding the parts that would be removed , the address sat and the date .
all were in Ul@@ san Ros@@ ales del Toro , just the ministers could have been approved by the Minister .
from this , the responsibility was over and the letters were increasingly often more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for two years for the still@@ s of factory and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money &quot; sugar be@@ et , no money , &quot; insured .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the pen@@ sion@@ ing of another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will in the de@@ composition of the factory , in whose construction he helped to help .
with each part , which he remote , disman@@ tled one of his 31 work years .
the best developed industrial range of Cuba and most important work in the world was removed .
in many cases , there are no alternatives to the work and performance that have generated , in which they were generated in the municipalities where they were found .
we never know , whether during the Mam@@ mut address given from 21 October 2002 , the former president in the eyes of the present person saw , when he was guaranteed for the areas , whose factories have been in operation for five years .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar pipe factories
since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted of just high by M@@ values .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ ali@@ ch started to change many things , but not always to improvements if a factory is closed .
when the sugar tube factory finished , or better , when she started to fly on , they heard it to paved the road to asp@@ hal@@ ve this way .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy other factories had to search other factories .
they were spare parts for spare parts .
without future prospects , many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory created , whose production serves not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty people bring to the old soldiers to spend a R@@ ente of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years in Ma@@ ñ@@ ali@@ ch .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man for skin of skin , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is no more efficient person , but he will be the lies that you told him .
you can open him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes back with 65 years in R@@ ente , not because it is missing it missing , but because he is tor@@ tured .

first Nations @-@ teenagers use hip @-@ hop to press and receive their own culture

photo used with permission from N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
yo@@ ungst@@ ers of the First Nations @-@ communities in all Canada deal with topics that are important for they are important . they do with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour since 2014 On the workshop of mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres , to accommodate groups of song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agog@@ y David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and in Northern Quebec , with ten C@@ ree communities , and then worked with the C@@ ree hip @-@ hop group The North@@ stars .
the workshop rises to that the young participation in discussions , such as &quot; cultural identity , &quot; language , confron@@ tation , love , self @-@ acceptable , &quot; or what they always comes in the sense .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , in which the young people are the main actor .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations @-@ communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the region of the kit@@ o , tells the history of the Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in West@@ kan@@ ada , on which nearly two dozen young women disappeared or killed or killed .
cases were not clari@@ fied in the cases .
the next video of the Nem@@ i C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to communicate , as important for the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influence of Glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people did not participate in the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ o@@ o@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First nation will have recorded the re@@ rain in C@@ ree .
the young people took some help from Gary J@@ olly left the North@@ star hip @-@ hop group , who has a st@@ rop@@ he in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
at the Fac@@ ebo@@ ok@@ side of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an stands the st@@ rop@@ he in tran@@ scription , also a translation into the English , which is translated into German by the German :
sometimes I feel sometimes , I would not be ever interested in me .
but I try to go on earth my days on earth .
that &apos;s the day you &apos;ll be able to take our Sch@@ rei .
because we lost our way to life in the life .
but I believe it in mind that we will participate in our day
I don &apos;t want to see how they are a bad life
so they can grow and do them at the same time .
so they can do this , to do it the cre@@ ator .

in Japan you can see almost any restaurant of plastic dishes at almost any restaurant .
to show potential customers , what is what exactly on the menu , will be served close to the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the same , &quot; Plas@@ tic@@ ular models of the dishes &quot; ) is served by every food that will be served in this restaurant .
the customers will see this plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant , or continue on .
there is a whole industry , dedicated to the production of these plastic bags .
the Tok@@ el@@ ashi is a variety of these small companies who manufacture the plastic film W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a in his film in Tokyo @-@ G@@ a .
most of Japanese these plastic are these plastic bags , usually they are not even more common to all . a new trend turns it today in current mobile phone accessories and other G@@ ad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the B@@ logger has published a series of social media links and photos , showing these unusual Twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin sandy pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic parts decorative mobile phone bands , as they are displayed at the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji to@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial food were turned to kit@@ schi@@ gen collection objects , as in this case , Ku@@ ehl@@ sol@@ ete :
here are a few Sho@@ z@@ hin Ku@@ sol@@ ete for a new exhibition in the Tokyo @-@ Station .
the new boom of the Ess@@ ence provisions is increasingly elaborate .
in this case , a ka@@ ans @-@ don ( a popular travel case with seaf@@ ood ) was turned into a mobile phone stand .
we have found a mobile phone stand for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) .
we also have produced this part for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is a apple which makes your mobile phone :
designed to choose like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that &apos;s only the beginning of an increasing escape to the compass .
some mobile phone support and mobile phone designers allow your own work of art . in this case , i@@ cur@@ a or salmon is used , a popular destination , which is served with white rice is served .
on Twitter , some users had their doub@@ ts :
if I want to meet someone of the things : &quot; W@@ ow , cool , now I can give my mobile phone with salmon sugar ? . &quot;
I think I will probably be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes also can also accept a fewer , official form to surprise , for example , colleagues and family members un@@ pleasant .
our latest mobile phone stand is the shape of melting the ice .
in addition , there is also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand mol@@ yb@@ den@@ um with dried salmon .
you can see other types of plastic , you can see under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # , the same ...
if you want to learn more about the origin of this trends , then you will find this video an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi that is dedicated to the Bel@@ ale of the Restaurant industry . like for example , with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin sandy pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic bags are actually made .

in reports and foreign media about the inf@@ amous &quot; fight against the drug trading in Mexico dive the missing and gear regularly only in statistics . however , this is not the extent of the human trage@@ dy that brings this struggle with this struggle .
the reporting on Drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Kart@@ ells , the stories of the victims of conflicts completely right in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looking to the trau@@ ma or to the commun@@ es who have learned to live with the pain .
behind each Lei@@ che , behind each bone mass in the hundred thousand graves in the hundreds of graves , the stories of children , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose guards are never healing .
therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico was called &quot; A@@ pr@@ a a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug trading live &quot; ) to give a voice to the life and stories of people who told them in the fight between the criminal authorities and st@@ ellen .
Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organized crime against us not only to fear our lives .
the effects are much deep @-@ reaching .
for example , if shops have close , because they are threatened by drugs , and whole communities are to run for many kilometers , to buy something like milk .
the pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; such as fear ) tells exactly these stories .
one main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father , who is looking for every weekend , to his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost her father to her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of its neph@@ ew .
priest : &quot; like every Sunday , we prepare for us again to the task which we put us , and go to graves , after humans that we loved you . &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
on October 15th he should return back again , but he came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me because I am now with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother who is also here with me .
at the moment they have no income .
your stands out the insurance of my father , but the gets it out , because the death certificate .
where we should I get the because &quot;
the editorial of &quot; A@@ pr@@ a vivi@@ r con el nar@@ co , &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we must not only show the faces of those who show the fear of fear . we have to show the conflicts in the international community , the Liberation and state guide .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a read of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this contribution from tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution is reminds us that you should never take violence as normal , no matter , in which form they will occur :
I know , for some years , illness and Sens@@ ation journ@@ alism I know now for some years .
I come up every day from newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with images that are actually only composed of a teacher for Cri@@ min@@ ology or from Ak@@ ten specialists .
it brings me from the version .
sometimes , I feel the feeling that I am the only one or sad , it is sad , as a lack of respect to respect for the person who once belonged to this body once a lack of respect .
I cannot be valid or can be regarded as normal or normal .
you have to writes :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin think that he is big . and it is not normal that people can hear about the &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ ates &quot; of the Stra@@ ight , if they go through the streets .
for me , that is , when they would have those who have lost , and those who fear to fear that them happens to be something .
I see our weakness when stories will be naked numbers in an statisti@@ c .
the facts of the man is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance can be justified by 43 students in a neighbour place therefore they were justified . &quot;
I think they try to talk about that they are spar@@ ed from such a load , if they did not stir and quiet .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; four months Er@@ press@@ ung in the main city , &quot; as a family with thre@@ ats , it describes as armed criminal month for the month of their business , until they were not only destroyed by the end , but also their family apart .
you think about everything you have lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain mentioned above is never before the grape of trau@@ ma , the fear comes back again , if you are alone .
we have changed , phone numbers also have changed .
we contact us only if it is absolutely necessary .
depending on the track we can be removed from each other .
she completed their report with words :
we want to be arrested that the other is arrested , for you don &apos;t know when they lead you or kill you .
I asked me in this slow@@ est days , but it would be sure to solve my deep@@ ened feelings , but the name is no , because I don &apos;t forget how to get wine . I must learn how to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of violence . &quot;
in the introduction , he set up questions on how : who does care about the child of a mixed wife and a man who was murdered by the organized crime ?
how is it , in a settlement on the edge of the endanger@@ ing city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , their parents take care of care .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an@@ age and he tells himself , how to make a egg , potatoes , tortillas and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the Bab@@ ies , who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of food with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine Nar@@ ben on his left side - one for each year .
however , they are unknown in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ aus@@ ing for a young man for the whole life of violence , and to learn how to live .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had van@@ ished .
but this was not the day after the childhood ended .
his childhood has been over two years before , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody Lei@@ che saw his father , who had been killed by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born as Br@@ yan , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez is made out of :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was carried out by the organized crime and the fight against humanity , with the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most endanger@@ ed town in the world due to the number of civil servants for public safety and government of the government of the United States .
in 2010 , the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the average 8.5 rate per day .
these are only some of hundreds of thousands of stories that organised the organized crime in Mexico leaves and penet@@ rate into the soul of the country .
only few stories live in view of the new head@@ lines . this project reminds us of those who don &apos;t forget to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ a a Vi@@ vir Con &quot; in 2015 , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico was called &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 , whose goal is to present the complex information on the failed struggle against the drug , which the country has brought into the past four decades , in a few kind of way .

the factor check is important in an moment in which it goes out to lift a bu@@ zz or a counter@@ f@@ eit .
but how is the years after something the first time ever up is ? content in social media , whether a true or un@@ true , even further to exist .
we take this photo of a terrible accident in front of seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first release , it has been used to have ir@@ reversible effects in order to have trage@@ dies , which actually have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false description of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - is not the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage regarding events in the DR of Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
it &apos;s possible to ask questions about our desire to pictures .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker moved to the town of San@@ ge in the east of the DR of Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te and explo@@ ded over 230 people .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country has been negl@@ ected and devast@@ ated , which were devast@@ ated . the streets in the region were turned into dangerous sc@@ ades full of drummer who had become difficult to travel .
the tank trucks fell victim to the tan@@ ker .
a fire@@ ball is described as a fire@@ ball , the d@@ utz@@ ing houses , including a cinem@@ as in the vicinity , the full of people who had experienced the football World Cup .
houses and wired cor@@ ders in the streets are scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the Un@@ ity .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ users My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ multiple photos of the incident form the gray content of this day .
above is an example for this .
it shows the ranks of the series , which are mounted on the floor , while people are looking for people .
but here you don &apos;t find the story here .
over the years , the same photograph has been upgraded several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , but not so much in the context of trage@@ dy , especially the events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar .
on 3 January 2015 , Bok@@ o Har@@ am participated in Bok@@ ho@@ ist@@ ani village of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
ey@@ epi@@ ece reported dras@@ tically of atro@@ cities , before whom they had to flee .
houses and shops have been burned in roads and pra@@ ying in the streets and pra@@ yers .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were instrumental in .
however , the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; nobody stayed back to count Lei@@ chen , &quot; said a population of Human Rights Watch .
many were zer@@ y , shot or burnt .
only on the basis of satellite imag@@ ery , the following periods could be illustrated .
the reason for the attack remained un@@ resolved , but the army leadership in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military @-@ Nigeria and the attempt by Bok@@ o Har@@ am , country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture dating back to the DR of the Congo , as it was proof of evidence for the fact , and the possible quantity of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre in 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
you are not Charlie .
you are dead .
in fact , these ab@@ uses of the image from the DR of Congo is only one in a number of errors ; Africa check has been documented in order to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the image was brought down as a reward of the measures .
another step further refine your comments , such as this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in connection to be arguments .
the picture from San@@ ge also joined together with the dead@@ ly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash , published by the United Nations , those who could flee ra@@ ge , rape , and many dead , some of which are of burning .
during the other by the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya reported , Po@@ sts like the following places that these descriptions were brought together with photos from the DR of Congo .
this picture comes from a aci@@ di Arabian news page , which was cont@@ acted by President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ a , who said the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims allegedly participated in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR of Congo to use this information .
the original contribution to be accessed on the last April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations , the AFP when their source had fal@@ sely attributed to His testimony , but didn &apos;t have the picture from the DR of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
the worldwide operating system
tracks of this false coupling are back up to the years 2011 and 2012 and come to all over the world .
with an &quot; converted &quot; picture @-@ aging , &quot; you can see how far more information can &apos;t exceed the borders .
a converted photo search for the search engine of the Tin@@ Eye has also found 3@@ 44 pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , who are also very similar to the DR of the DR of Congo .
they come from a mixed lot of private sites , platforms social media and community , and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , Dutch , Greek and Portuguese .
some have false reports on , and have others tried to escape the counter@@ f@@ eit notes .
we have been using examples of ab@@ mis@@ sive use , and it was associated with the respective countries , on the basis of which it had been published , which , by page , we want the range of more significant than by the language alone .
in some cases , several examples have been associated with each other ( in some cases ) , several examples are used for mis@@ sive use .
here some cases which can now be split ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : news Fra@@ mes .
country examples of the wrong application of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ fet@@ al countries show on pages or servers , over the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit notes or fal@@ low messages are still available .
the countries in grey are examples , which according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via the Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ f@@ eit examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR of Congo was established in an online discussion forum , addressed in an online discussion forum , as part of a threads to the &quot; war of the Budd@@ hi@@ sts . &quot;

T@@ wit@@ zer amounts according to the massacre of Bok@@ o Har@@ am , as this here , who used the picture from the DR of Congo used to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , have not seen any pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster .

even within Nigeria the photo was split by the DR of the DR of Congo as an proof for the bombing of Bok@@ o Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion for@@ ums .

Malaysia also offers two extreme example of a mis@@ erable use of the DR Congo , on the other hand , and on the other hand , the asser@@ tion of a blo@@ g@@ gers , the alleg@@ ations , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are pursued , as yet the photos uses some mis@@ understanding .
Myanmar , 2017 .
in Myanmar , the government of Myanmar , published a Rich@@ tig@@ ating News and photos , the international media , international human rights and governments , came into an attempt to create mis@@ understanding of Myanmar . &quot;
this Rich@@ tig@@ ating which has been published exclusively on English , has also be used on many different images of rum@@ ors that were used by h@@ ate Spe@@ ech , and by extreme mis@@ tic groups , Muslims kill kill and elsewhere ( which is often used by bur@@ m@@ ary nation@@ alists ) .

this post , which was addressed to the Rus@@ so @-@ Orthodox community , is clear that the picture of the DR of the Congo N@@ ICH@@ T Muslims shows the Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page maintained that when the President of Myanmar is moving to him , that the monks and politi@@ cian on the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims had been involved , and brought the story together with the image from San@@ ge .
the article was updated and published in 2014 and at the time of this release , the image is still included .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article by 2014 about students who had been released by Bok@@ o Har@@ am , published by Bok@@ i Har@@ am , has expressly stated that the image is not affected by the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it claims a &quot; similar properties . &quot;
when the picture later found in circulation with the massacre of Bok@@ o Har@@ am in circulation in circulation , the newspaper El PA@@ IS tried to resist that it would be connections to Nigeria .

they wanted to achieve that in the communities of these events , the mut@@ ated in the name of Islam took place , a major attention .
United States , 2015 .
the image was set up as a reward of the massacre of Bok@@ o Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ret@@ ali@@ et@@ et ) . but the emb@@ assi@@ es were associated with that were in no religious context .
instead , the target was to set attention to the relative number of dead and a comparison of media reports compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( esian ) , 2014 .
after an message , which was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos , &quot; of the ni@@ geri@@ an massacres , had been written in circulation , and reported discussion for@@ ums like this here on Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to the Fal@@ ch@@ ment .
from the Embassy , which was included in the picture from the DR of Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos .
there are further confirmed examples of an error using the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other Ac@@ counts , the aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) has to be more completely tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
data applications with UR@@ Ls and time / data application exist on the web cra@@ wler and compatible , they feature image data in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims .
in all these cases , the picture was released clearly after the original bad period of 2010 , the picture may possibly be a correct description , but the original fee is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two powerful topics or frames ( tim@@ et@@ able ) that pass this post . the first frame focuses on religion .
the picture was used in relation to larger discussions about the tail in relation to those worn by Christians , or to defense of Muslims - the assassin@@ ations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second question@@ n@@ ming used to discuss the image as an African life in comparison to a European or French life .
religion to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it &apos;s worth to investigate how pictures can be used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question is , however , what happens if read this pictures cannot hear these pictures .
with social media , there are remarkable people who have un@@ intended for the un@@ intended share of water around a trage@@ dy .
suggests this atmosphere of the fault or fal@@ low information that are true that real estate is true , and tast@@ es the actual Gre@@ y of what actually is in the DR of the Congo , Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the diss@@ em@@ ination of violent images was already shown in detail ( e.g. , for example ) .
an argument is that the return of pictures of a ref@@ usal to recognize the trage@@ dy . up to time , these pictures even requires the victims even of the victims .
at the same time , the Sorge , that &apos;s non @-@ violent pictures and viewer des@@ how and them the ability to reach Emp@@ ath@@ y ( such as this study , which investigated the investigated , such as violent media , others ) .
while it has a lot regarding non @-@ violent represent@@ ations in the news media , the fact that they are indispensable for the present news release date .
Techn@@ om@@ ologist experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; you &apos;ll need to pay a little over the situation , in which a picture is somewhat suggested , but what can actually be used by the context or completely mis@@ used species .
one of his investigation fal@@ si@@ ance , should also be taken into account as internationally they can be internationally .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons , according to CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. d@@ une un@@ table ) has been committed to provide language @-@ enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world , that difficult or at all .
those words available in every language : you press certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ mistak@@ able words are already well known ( such as the famous Portuguese acid ) and others , that is deeply affected in a special culture , ( for example , the Spanish Sob@@ y@@ ol@@ esa ) .
but all resist@@ ors are hard @-@ c@@ eful every trial of an easy translation .
a word or any term is not enough to understand what a full explanation and sometimes a regular context are necessary to understand what is meant with this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
most of these lists of Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog we find for example words from the actual language of Van@@ u@@ atu , as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Turn your parents in recognition of how to have been involved in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ hi@@ es language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or F@@ aul@@ ts that you feels like to get there in cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his Blog :
you have other crops , un@@ lock other cultures , un@@ lock other cultures and aw@@ aken our new gi@@ er@@ de .
sometimes , as we have influence the world around the world around and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ist on this page and show more of these &quot; un@@ matched &quot; words , and show how different , valuable and impressive are of these small languages .
Red@@ ner of the &quot; Treasure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which will be very appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to download their favorite music here .

like Sri Lanka with the worst flood disaster of the decade .
the island of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood of flood and re@@ dr@@ ut@@ cat@@ astrophe in this decade .
triggered by the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya rise in 15 districts in the south and west of the country via the bank .
after a opinion of the cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c centre of Sri Lanka , May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and around hundreds of people are affected due to the flo@@ ods and s@@ amm@@ la@@ ths .
since last Friday ( 26 May ) , over 400 000 people are affected and about 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe deposit of inhabitants .
the rainy events left on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water residues in some areas went slow .
health and hygiene conditions of the population provide a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos were con@@ vey an impression of the extent of the Fl@@ ut@@ cat@@ astrophe :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water stands of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka , deliver regular updates to high @-@ water situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of the cat@@ astrophe .
Sri Lan@@ kas killed the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fied crisis , war@@ n Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls already are on the way .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also over@@ flo@@ oded the water of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has added five aircraft for life@@ times , and further five are completed for transport@@ ing emergency deliveries in their flo@@ oded villages .
also various organisations and start @-@ ups have been declared to help .
Facebook @-@ pages such as help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster relief - Information Des@@ ire Sri Lanka supply important information about high @-@ water situation and humanitarian assistance .
if any search and rescue teams have to be dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
intended for all those who want to dry food and life goods for flood victims !
we are today in the area around Kel@@ en@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need to help animals in this region .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pic@@ me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , thus the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ Center is informed .
last year after the disaster of the Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , who allowed them to call a &quot; high water @-@ help &quot; button to retri@@ eve the vehicle for the transfer of assistance and donations . these were then forwar@@ ded to the s@@ ri@@ lan@@ k@@ ische Red Cross .
the &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key also led to a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which had more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat lines for the first round .
the agreed efforts of the government and civil population Sri Lan@@ kas , where several social media platforms will be fully performed , bring inhabitants in need of safety and help in need in need of security and help .
this has prevented the loss of more human beings , whereas the population Sri Lan@@ kas has now be the long way up to the restoration of the norm@@ ality .
the Muslims who cannot see it
the Women &apos;s March 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
the use of the Dam@@ als in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour in and love .
I trusted her my four year old daughter , she entrusted with me their children , and she is my rock in the industry .
in one minute , we call Par@@ oles for the rights of women .
in the next s@@ wis@@ s we en@@ code rights to trans@@ forming rights .
we are located in a sea of rain screens and people , some hold the icon@@ ographic image of a woman with head @-@ cloth , bound up of an American flag , other s@@ kan@@ en@@ act against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
my gir@@ l@@ friend went me to and says : &quot; these things are not necessary thee , or ? &quot; why , because I did not hesitate to Muslims ? . &quot;
I have already led these entertainment .
people , with whom I work or people who know me for many years ago - the Sah@@ ar , who they know it - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in its performance .
you get mus@@ cul@@ ature me .
there are a total of 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we will not see all the same .
we practic@@ ed our religion .
we identi@@ fying us to be Muslim , on different art . but somehow , we &apos;ll be able to connect all of the same Muslim dra@@ wer .
these dra@@ wer is so good in our collective performance such as soon as soon as Muslims who fit as I don &apos;t fit there .
in terms of climate control
I ste@@ h not only alone .
this is even the poet , whose poetry was sold in America , Rum@@ i .
what pictures are in a sense when you think about him ?
love ?
?
as J@@ al@@ al@@ u@@ dd@@ in Rum@@ i as old as I am now , he was a Orthodox mus@@ cular pre@@ acher and yellow pre@@ acher .
Islam , Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day , where he died , the center of His poetry .
but in the western idea was deleted by Religion Rum@@ is , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of the induc@@ tive images of Muslims , the Western books has been colonial for centuries since centuries .
this loos@@ ening image language is determined by the dark man that you should fear and to save the exotic woman who need to save .
the pioneering Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid took the history behind this pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures can also see even today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood , they continued to continue .
I have worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry , and I &apos;ve seen how this powerful , faul@@ ts of our news@@ letters were domin@@ ate .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v won the reality , which led to their countries during the last three decades , nine Muslim women have led their countries to choose the first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v to recognize that when French , Muslim women are able to wear their head@@ board in public buildings and acid @-@ Arab , Muslim women due to their government to cover their entire body , which these are both sides of the same Medal .
a powerful group exercises its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; others . &quot;

my mus@@ cular belief and behavior are maybe not always visible , but they are there .
maybe I would have my gir@@ l@@ friend , my neighbour in the presence of my house that I am Muslim when they could take over 15 meters of concrete and air , who could separate our houses .
they would see the all@@ ying R@@ itual with my daughter , when I see them in my arms and the Arab verses to protect the Kor@@ an and the Q@@ ul@@ s called .
for each of them , I repeat three times .
I therefore mean that they are protected from the evil , the evil , you can see and evil , that can &apos;t see .

initiative of narrative art wants to preserve urban voice variety .

may it possible to give it a possibility , here and now in spite of a language barrier with somebody for connection ?
Steven Bird and Ro@@ by@@ n Per@@ ry , founder of the Treasure Language Stor@@ y@@ ( T@@ LS ) , is the creation of stories in their original language .
global Vo@@ ices reported a short initiative by Steven Bird , the un@@ interrupted blog .
however , the focus of T@@ LS are not written on the written word , but on the word of the word . it concerns an attempt to obtain a language variety of major cities and worthy to worthy .
in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia are in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not to be passed away there .
for the project :
the mass mortality of the world can be avoided when we wanted to create the diversity , diversity and safe rooms which are not forgotten in which inhabitants are not forgotten .
while &quot; to listen to this , &quot; check this events instead of &quot; to hear these events instead , &quot; the listen@@ ers to estimate how to make it all . &quot;
in this format , your story will initially set up their history at their own language and transfer , or explain it in English .
even if the participants are not a professional @-@ generation counter , making their hus@@ bands and account for their representation that the accessibility can be changed .
they call laugh@@ ter and Emo@@ tions , when the language would not have a barrier .
the following video shows a traditional history of Burkina Faso , who tells us in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this lap , the history of R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou con@@ ate the opportunity to explained that for their land typical of narrative art .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the fork from the ha@@ zi@@ ans and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after winning the importance of its fork , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked , &quot; how is that to talk to an audience that your language does not understand ? &quot; with a wide m@@ in@@ sen , he comments on the inclusive of the inclusive :
you have heard it !
they were very happy ...
they were all at me !
currently , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ y@@ ma have taken place in three cities , and the organis@@ ers hope to extend this . all those who are inspired by the project , can compete with T@@ LS in contact with T@@ LS in contact with T@@ LS .
Puerto Rico calls for the national debt of the national school .
with the aim of a new public debt of Puerto Rico , several religious and civil organizations participated in a mass demonstration ; the Mar@@ sch started on April 3rd , 2017 . Mar@@ sch started out in the centre of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the Old Town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group of Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano de la Deu@@ da , &quot; Ci@@ tiz@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da . &quot; ( the front of the neur@@ ons ) and the Ö@@ kom@@ en@@ ical Church in Puerto Ric@@ os .
the interc@@ essors of the recent deb@@ ts of debt have also submitted a pe@@ tition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os calls for the politicians , ben@@ ches and government agencies that are responsible for the deb@@ tors .
we challenge a financial exam and a test committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions appropriate for compensation , which in favour of the economy .
we will press pres@@ tige and suppres@@ sed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os refused to pay a debt to pay a debt which is not her .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be found with sin@@ king pay@@ outs .
we require immediate measures .
the island - not in the lower High territory of the USA - is suffering from a major financial crisis .
hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a government @-@ independent non @-@ profit organization without party funding with focus on socio @-@ economic development , an Act on the sovereign state , as an alternative to the existing state of State .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of state @-@ government infrastructure .
on the outside of the current measures , without the participation of the participation , and the risks of citizens are going to be carried out by the people .

the Syrian Palestinian developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been a year since over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters , and members of the campaign for his freedom and recall that he has made an open network .

the book , which was published in the last year and is free here , contains a number of principles which deal with the free culture in the face of suppression .
it is an homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction :
this book would like to discuss the movements for fre@@ es knowledge and which is the true cost to be connected with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers , and authors who worked on the movements of Free knowledge , have worked on site to provide about the ne@@ b@@ ula , which gives our news@@ letters and create a slightly sense from our different experience .
this book is an attempt to release Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the loving care and celebrated Internet volunteer since March 15 , 2012 in Syria .
his name was formed from the directory of the A@@ dra Maj@@ estic Product , which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
we have since then no information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective diplom@@ ats gives his friends and his family a voice , who want to fit his release and put him back in its normal life and freedom .
see how Bas@@ sel has a high price for his participation in a free culture , has many of us begin to think about their own fate , de@@ eds and decisions .
why are we are here ?
we opted for us ?
what we did in this process of expression of extreme beli@@ efs ?
the web developer for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody of Syrian government since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and An@@ no@@ tin N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ sel was on the basis of a &quot; strictly printed &quot; recorded by the Military Court of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she had been cont@@ acted by people on 12 November 2015 , who ordered itself as a In@@ sider of the Assad government , and they ordered by an alleged death sentence against their husband .
however , his stay place and condition remain unknown .
a leader in Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a decisive role that access to the internet and to the knowledge of the public in Syria .
Bar@@ ry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , technical ologist and currently over@@ sees the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps there was none of bass prototypes as the factory , which he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 , to construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the passing of numerous civilian populations and im@@ migr@@ ate the Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles of local traditions and per@@ si@@ can .
at that time , Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after having started working with this work , this architecture , which is not only the cultural heritage of the world , but the world em@@ bodied .
this cart@@ on into the digital archae@@ ology and the preservation has created a time , which will be presented to the public as well as scientists and artists in the future of in@@ valuable value .
in this project , Bas@@ sel has been able to finish this project so far .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life so that freedom to dream and Bas@@ sel taught me , they are poor .
I have been overwhel@@ med by the name , I am overwhel@@ med .
Bas@@ sel brought me to me in English , even when he was in prison .
I learned to read English well , write and speak English .
he has always dealt with any knowledge that he has asked , &quot; he has taught many In@@ dies , English , write and speak to speak .
Bas@@ sel has opened the gate for technology . he taught me , both computers as well as Smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
he has also brought other in@@ tra , as they use computer , at least theore@@ tically , without it actually kept one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a pro@@ sab@@ book that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was arrested in detention .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a have worked together with the book for one year .
she sailed the text to him when she came to him , and he translated them from the Arab in English .
the book is free of charge .

bass &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 the regime of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Ass@@ ad are gone through the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian network for Human Rights ) over 6@@ 5.000 people .
those who were arrested or were imprisoned in the violence of the regime , were tor@@ tured or even executed .
by 2016 the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International had died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans in jail since 2011 .
the stories of many more people stay unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community calls for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
we repeat our demand in hope that we must do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambi@@ k : due to corruption and sentenced to recent years due to corruption .
Mos@@ ambique &apos;s re@@ signed with wrath on a cor@@ rupt case , in which a member after half of his prison sentence returned to the workplace in which corruption was committed to the corruption .
it concerns Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who in 2008 was arrested and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment with four other def@@ endants because of the un@@ tre@@ ance of 54 million Me@@ al ( approximately 800 000 Euro ) .
the money desc@@ ended from public funds of the airports of Mozambique , whose Council Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good guided tour , and called on his re@@ setting to the company what happened on April 19 , then .
in accordance with an opinion from the General At@@ tor@@ ney &apos;s Office of the Republic that would have no obst@@ acles for Cam@@ ba@@ za , again , because the company has not moved his old proceedings after his detention .
however , hot inhabitants are not good .
the Centre for public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short CIP ) , a local institution , which was condemned to public transparency , sentenced in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision to set the company &apos;s decision to set the director .
represents a return in the fight against the corruption measures and clear , the feeding of transparency and is even a backward step in terms of the efforts of our legal system , the CIP system .
what we take note of the company that the company would have had a disciplinary proceedings against the supply negoti@@ ating .
however the company does not occur and causes no reasonable legal steps for the application of the respective functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the mos@@ aic social media , plays this behavior and considered as &quot; resist@@ ed &quot; :
when Cam@@ ba@@ za is a competent type , he would have been an adviser after having been sentenced to prison , and half of which were reduced by half .
he could advise lectures and motiv@@ ating speak , he could consult and his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has been approved in the company re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to add damage to the company .
consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is paid for his tail .
get rid of the resistance !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , a young Mos@@ ambi@@ ans and student of the political science in Brazil , says the Director of any Mor@@ al :
Cam@@ ba@@ za of the state was rewarded , because he cannot believe him that I want to meet someone at such a way that the state has already been massi@@ vely massi@@ f .
Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing the Mor@@ al back and to serve the state , * which had already serve a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead , only on the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state , as a handy money source , and the state itself has become a tired , and the state itself was tired and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Fran@@ ce@@ y Ze@@ ú@@ te , preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , remember that a di@@ eb belongs to the prison :
Di@@ ebe belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , not only to remain as the first independent President in memory , but also as a scar@@ let , cutting and - next to - proph@@ etic Red@@ ner .
one of its most famous oral ren@@ der@@ ings , as he confirmed that &quot; an ambitious human beings is to be able to sell the pat@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , its own individual interested parties . &quot;
Sam@@ ora said : &quot; I don &apos;t know , if an ambitious human being changes , my experience shows that the tac@@ tic , but he is not of his ambi@@ tions .
an ambitious human man is at the same time . &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also ab@@ sent :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years and came free .

according to the information of Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network started their podium from the net because they had the word &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; .
although above the origin of the Word still has been discussed , it will usually be used to refer to people of indigenous origin or generally as Ad@@ dress . &quot;
Facebook is the word &quot; kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; anointed &quot; ( in bur@@ ners &quot; ) as part of an initiative to go the widespread problem of the Hass@@ elt language in Burma in the social network .
in the past few years , the ascent of radical national movements has given an extremely ab@@ normal con@@ forms to the word .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra nation@@ alists than Hass@@ ol , which is a minority against Muslims who constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar .
however in an effort , Hass@@ elt , in Myanmar , the company has a lot of sensible content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ mag today usually be associated with rac@@ ism in conjunction with rac@@ ism , but the word is not automatically revealed .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people reported that Po@@ sts have said to be , in which they have used the use of the word , or doub@@ ts for the use of his service .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic markers that have the same letter sequence like &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ mes@@ an even &apos; kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words as &apos; kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ ree ) , &apos; kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the fac@@ ebo@@ ok@@ y Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various translations of words with the sound of &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the word .
however , he had asked his friends on a spiritual nature , whether they could w@@ ush his back pain , by creating a word .
the set ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku &quot; ) + the question@@ naire ( la ) to Bur@@ mes@@ an - resem@@ bles the ra@@ cial expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
in Win , Z@@ in Win is the opinion that it did not reduce the presence of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook analy@@ tic must spread all Po@@ sts , to spread in the susp@@ ici@@ on of Rac@@ ism .
Facebook is not manual the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it automatically filters the word automatically .
the Automati@@ m is not understand what you encounter with Fac@@ be@@ o@@ ok .
what it instead , should make the post carefully analyse and control it by clicking the next words .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; ( sp@@ aw@@ b@@ sen ) .
the Good is that this three @-@ star nation@@ alists , the Hass@@ elt language , has a pretty good lesson .
now it is on the time to prevent their Nation@@ alism .
while the action is a powerful signal to all you like to spread the Hass@@ elt , like the efficiency of this strategy is not long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proved that the c@@ ens@@ orship of drummer will often start to start any kind of social networks , creating a new word or an alternative way to use their views to their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described as Facebook started to ext@@ ingu@@ ish his Po@@ sts , as he just wanted to communicate his friends , that the word &apos; cal@@ ar &apos; of the social network is ex@@ iled :
... when I became aware of the new Directive of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends , that the word is locked .
after it , my post was removed from Facebook and me , the li@@ ken , post , position and parts of contents for 24 hours , because the post &quot; post &quot; Facebook community has not been established . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of Po@@ sts of people who have no negative descent , or the simply try to show their opinions against the hate nation@@ alist nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ ph@@ y wrote that his post office has been removed , nothing has to do with Hass@@ elt :
postal address is located by Facebook without a sign from Facebook .
in the post , the author started his opinion about extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should do more in front of the initiative to do more , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community have questions :
Facebook like a well @-@ looking intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
such words , only more hatred will bring to more hatred within the various communities .
in addition , it appears as if they started without any local context or technical support , and so words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; r@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry &quot; banned .
even if they found out that they did not have any mistakes , they were not tried to maintain the deser@@ ved Po@@ sts .
if they only accounted for a little more respect for the 15 million benefit , who would have a great turnover , would be great .
Fac@@ ved auto @-@ c@@ ens@@ orship for much Sp@@ ott among the users .
instead of it , users are now fun and write the word &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ elt , to see whether their podium will be taken from the grid .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook @-@ Po@@ sts , who don &apos;t have a Hass@@ elt language but nevertheless removed :
in use with approval .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and a pe@@ a cur@@ ry and a Indian film .
only to try to try Facebook , the word is called the word . &quot;
screen@@ shot , with approval .
&quot; If you are said , &quot; If you are a doctor , heal me ? &quot;
screen@@ shot , with approval .
over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious discovery are used to have social networks to improve their voices and their influence .
among other things , Hass@@ elt , in addition to social networks in addition to violence in the Churches in Myanmar , especially in the area Rak@@ h@@ ine , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have been forced thousands to escape .
Facebook was said to be to be cri@@ tici@@ zed by his bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control , cri@@ tici@@ zed to his bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control .
but rather than simply the word &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to know more in the context as shown on the code @-@ concentrated initiatives and of them .

the children before , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now illegal .
on 9 June 2017 , the state of the country has unanimously approved a law to provide these practice , so that the so @-@ friendly old age is now 18 .
prior to this change , there was a number of members of religious and mus@@ cul@@ ation communities . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the religious religious groups of the country , said that the state could not be certain that the state must be certain maturity . &quot;
this happened in the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is an authorized partner for the UN children &apos;s rights , which is the minority , every man under 18 years . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married with 15 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8,@@ 1 percent .
the State Central Office of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online pe@@ ti@@ tions and social media movements who ear@@ ns to create the laws of the children before , followed by the foot and inher@@ ited great support . no doubt , they will not perform this result .
nevertheless we didn &apos;t want to do everything .
a Hin@@ du leaders , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the children before , they should be dam@@ ned in order to take care of their own business . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition was actually un@@ complicated in these actually un@@ complicated matter , and sometime , there were doubt , whether the opposition came to the bill at all .
however , at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided - despite 4 transmitters ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him to the law .
now only the President of the country have to agree to the President and the law .
one of the country &apos;s content of the country gave to Facebook an status update that Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle at Inst@@ agra@@ m again :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the legislative design against the children &apos;s office was in a representative building with 35 votes against it and not only decided on the other hand .
after having decided in the Senate , the draft recommendation can now be appointed to the law .
the majority of the social media user was thri@@ lled because the laws had been changed to the children before .
Facebook @-@ member Lov@@ ell Francis , who held a Council of Ministers in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has a lot of time and opaque , which has used the core of the matter , but you know what ? the children before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s almost every price .
while exercising , the opinion was definitely enough , it was definitely enough to create the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was so happy that the day was finally come :
public Status update on Facebook von L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Her@@ vor@@ an news !
the couple has been agreed .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for them - 0 against it ! ! ! !
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that said quite openly about how important the adoption of the law , noted :
the home @-@ friendly old age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious powers of 18 years .
the draft for the amendment to Christianity was today , on 9 June 2017 , was decided on June 9 , 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 members of them were present at the vote .
all MP@@ s , which were assigned to the law , have been responsible for the law .
the children before , is not permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle against ... ) # 2,500
many thanks to all of the activists who have fo@@ stered him .
congratulations .
a Dan@@ ke to our MP@@ s .
however , a possible hook is found in the form of satellite Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization of the country .
before months , Mahar@@ aj successfully announced his intention to enter the law , and the law should be passed , and he appears to be a promise .
during the general prosecutor , Paris Al Ra@@ wi , a pro@@ vocation of law , said that it was quite lawful , when Mahar@@ aj was going to go on , it would cause most social media users , one would go different debate on the subject .
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed in front of :
dear satellite , if we want to talk about the discussion , that we will protect the state in our bedroom , so that it may protect them from great , hard @-@ sh@@ ot@@ ted men who need to be ab@@ used for them , &quot; would you be willing to continue the discussion ?
or believe that there is no problem ?
but whether it is now an important step toward the law , or not , this legislation is an important step , however , there are still places in the world where the children can be legal in various types of gra@@ dations and still the standard , although it does not exist .

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos , which he looked around around , never satisfied . they disappeared with a bad position and washed colors .
this motivated him to wear a camera to wear and try the situation too .
back then , he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to bring back to the international stage at the age of 28 .
and his home location directly next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos , which led the attention to Nep@@ als wildlife .
he described on Facebook , how to help him this first @-@ class location in his work :
I live at the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could give it better for a passionate wilderness ! !
I discovered me home when I was in Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ LM Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father , that the river of the Rap@@ ti river would be a Leopard .
the river river is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately , I started my camera with my camera , and was in a few minutes there .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river page , where the Leopard was immediately back and I started immediately , pictures ! ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to achieve a collaboration with the authorities to achieve global recognition of Nep@@ als in nature and like to prevent the understanding for this deep , wild animals did not as fur@@ mit@@ er , as they look like .
and he should know it , as he was already against face to face to face by face . :
a tiger is not out from the opinion of the sheep &apos;s opinion ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
I was also home because of the darkness to the home when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ ke appeared . he is immediately ur@@ ning , we see how and he h@@ unts me through the s@@ al @-@ trees ! !
in order to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I cli@@ cked for environmental protection ) on his photos .
his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als and nature , however , is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and lived mostly in a tent in order to play in the Bar@@ dia National Park photos from Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days , until he could photograph a tiger , and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , who live near the tourist information .

this entry was posted by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a written on Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award winning international community media organization in India .
a revised version was once again published as part of a Content Sharing Convention .
in many parts , India is to avoid women with the greatest care , the name of their hus@@ bands or even from older men in the family .
instead , they use a P@@ ron@@ eous or say &quot; Father of my child . &quot;
Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h until Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect to the husband and resp@@ ects the husband , as well as the fear of consequences , they should be ab@@ used to use this practice in life .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convicted in the Indian state of O@@ bit@@ a by a sh@@ ak@@ y and accompanied by their family and the village &apos;s community , after having addressed a relatives .
the tradition , their hus@@ bands also do not agree with the name , it is also common among men . however , they have much less@@ er , however , if ever , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health profession@@ s and domestic women , a unique club , and were thus fast to the main sth@@ al of the city .
it is a place only for they alone , in which they discuss the enemy of the patri@@ arch@@ ate Patri@@ arch@@ ate and discuss .
when one of 56 clubs , which is in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ mets , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and is responsible for the degra@@ dation of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z worked with the help of her video camera for seven years with the help of her video camera , such as children &apos;s marriage to the federation of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS , and runs these clubs .
it is reported as these clubs created a safe place for those women and they have made up at the same time as ambassador of the wall .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed the first video in their debate , &quot; the women who did not call their hus@@ bands .
she decided on this subject , because she wanted to open the talk about the patri@@ arch@@ ate with an issue which is easy to identify .
in question , the names of their hus@@ bands do not hesitate to address them , and he ple@@ aded not guilty to the question all of the gar@@ ment ple@@ aded not guilty .
Roh@@ ini :
this tradition is testified that a woman resp@@ ects their husband and wishes a long life .
a woman who cannot enter into one , is regarded as Mrs. without Mor@@ al .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted , so we have never made up to this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted to start his husband , so far , so far , had never before , at home , as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ mother .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my father @-@ in @-@ mother and my husband had still long , after the video was at the end .
intern@@ ash , my husband , turned out to me , and said to me that he will call him from now on his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first abstract club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that there was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , mostly girls and women .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , women trying to bring discussion with an exercise in gear .
Roh@@ ini , in every participant in the name of her husband , with various emotions to say - happy , expi@@ red , lov@@ ingly and so on .
then , she asked all , &quot; If we do not say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they would like to call us how they would like to resp@@ ects us ?
should not be more equal ? &quot;
for 30 years , &quot; some of these women have been married since 30 years and this was the first day to talk about the name of their hus@@ bands , &quot; says Roh@@ ini &apos;s village in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the latitude of a century history , married women the names of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so sh@@ y that she had only ed down during the exercise , and another , decided to move the whole fruit against him , and to the fight against him , by saying it .
the expression of their faces was anti@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
still in the adren@@ al@@ inus C@@ ausch der , with an ancient fires broke out , decided to call them at home , their hus@@ bands would have to call their hus@@ bands .
and they held her word .
in the next days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband called a wife called Roh@@ ini , and asked them to say ideas into the head : his wife was not able to listen to his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her father @-@ in @-@ her mother she received her star@@ ed , she got afraid , and said it was an error .
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini told me to do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in violence was less under@@ stand@@ ably and the situation art@@ ete in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women tries to stop other practices to stop other practices , such as the tra@@ der of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot points on Stir@@ n , who shows the For@@ est@@ atus :
why only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would bear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point when it would also be taken .
he only wrote , and I heard it , and I heard it .
the other women do not have completely rev@@ oked , but my place they are now in a better position , even to choose him at some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can consoli@@ date their opinions and targets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at any discussion club .
normally we take lunch and water a spot on the field .
I don &apos;t want to make sure the women make women make what could hear , &quot; says it . &quot;
in the last months she celebrated her own birth@@ days of cake for the first time in her own birthday with cakes ; she danced and cri@@ tic@@ ised about things about which they had never noticed .
Roh@@ ini said :
I &apos;ve been working for many years in this problems and yet I have been working for some things , for example as our identi@@ ties in our hus@@ bands are never so honest .
it feels great to say certain things , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we have given us about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothes with the clothes .
some women in the group have been carried out since their marriage , only Sar@@ is .
for most of the ok@@ ay , but some wanted to have a sal@@ low @-@ Kur@@ ta , a far Hem@@ d over a h@@ ose , they have not been her@@ ed .
after much fight and discussion about the benefits of the own hang@@ out , the Mor@@ al associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , ch@@ mu@@ g@@ sailed Roh@@ ini her own pair ( Ober@@ inhi@@ bits ) in a discussion round , so that women could bear them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , and in which they may bear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini &apos;s sure that they can create .
at the question of the question whether you have changed over the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirmed that the things have to come slowly .
we have so far made a small steps .
some women pro@@ bi@@ es have a few times , but heard again to say the name of their husband .
some , me included , but if they are alone , but only if they are alone and there are no other family members .
only one or two women continue to the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women carry on at any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their fore@@ head .
the women during the Discussion Papers - know that the changes that they want to reach in their life - as the f@@ eil@@ le for more movement of movement or its own clothes @-@ election - at the end of a difficult @-@ to @-@ navig@@ ate river .
by placing on the other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victims of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I have also been there .
but this club gives everyone of us that , however , will change something .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . if a chain reaction has been limited , if every woman is reported in the club and others reports , we talk about we speak and what we do .
we are sitting in the same boat .

Singapore : city or land ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore has a city or a country ?
the question may be du@@ mm@@ ed , since Singapore is recognised as an independent state as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ mu@@ zzle , Singapore is considered as a city .
this remarks has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere a debate .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York State , the ministers that many people cri@@ tici@@ zed the sole political party of Singapore , because they were compared to Singapore with other countries .
he supports the city that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has put into question whether New York is a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , but most people go to an error .
I tried to declare that we would be different .
we are a city .
we are no land .
the blog of Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused of the Minister of Justice , &quot; the logic , &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ it@@ ators of the power in Singapore .
and then , after all of our efforts and efforts , this precious country , that we could say that we finally gave no country .
it is so volcanic , it had been forced to escape a flight before the responsibilities .
Singapore , if you are not my country , w@@ essen the land is then ?
they were not very no@@ tion : he was not very no@@ tion : he defended an idea that could not measure the political system of Singapore not with other &quot; normal countries &apos; , in view of his mother , he appeared invisible .
in contrast , he has defended the idea that Singapore had to be compared to the cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , in the same way as the permanent cities of a party .
these cities are democr@@ atically elected .
once one reaches the subject point of the Th@@ as , the good old dead bodies of the authorized fe@@ e@@ ders , on the pre @-@ conf@@ use Dem@@ ok@@ rates , in the case of logic , they perform better to its power .
in the final week , in the final week of Shan@@ mu@@ te gave answers to his American guests concerning our press , our jewel , our political system really non @-@ answers .
relevant questions tar@@ red with non @-@ responses r@@ ational species .
Rachel Z@@ eng requires Shan@@ mu@@ gam upon his opinion , because they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ lowed .
if Singapore is not a country , but one city is , so that the country belongs to the city ...
shortly , I understand nothing .
I would be grat@@ eful if our wer@@ ter K Shan@@ mu@@ gam will clari@@ fy the effort to clari@@ fy these point , unless he was highly paid in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by clicking on the blog , he has published his comment on the reviews , so that you should read the entire scheme of the conference , so that in the context of the testimon@@ ies of Shan@@ mu@@ gam could be better , according to which Singapore has been a city and no country .
read the co @-@ section .
when he said , Singapore has said to be a &quot; City , &quot; stated as a country , &quot; stated why the elections in Singapore had so important , even if we are able to enjoy free and notable elections .
he won Singapore with cities in the USA ( and as many of these cities saw a party ? ) .
when he said , Singapore &quot; is no country , &quot; he did not appear in this sense !
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment over Shan@@ mu@@ gam , which makes the leader of a strong @-@ growing generation , such as a strong statement .
I &apos;m about that of the Minister of Justice of Singapore , I said , ...
at least , I knew with Lee ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , which I expected me - unless you agree with them , or not , that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ zzle , a member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I have doub@@ ts and I am not even certain whether he is properly performed , and he is aware of what he def@@ ends .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek review consists of the weak points of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
that Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam &quot; is committed to an error &quot; or was a pleas@@ ingly pleas@@ ur@@ ning ?
when Singapore is no land , we will be considered as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , in what country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the Inter@@ governmental Conference , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam of serious significance .
why make the Lon@@ av@@ ail able to their military service , they only defend her town but not her country ?
if our Prime Minister will have to be returned ?
what is the value of our pink staff ?
are we the citizen of a country or the residents of a city ?
that the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ yond , Singapore is always a city :
I haven &apos;t said , &quot; what I told &quot; &quot;
this set seems to be more expensive more expensive ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is one country .
we were always a city .
we were there a city @-@ view in the city of State .
I can understand that we often think as &quot; the defense of the country , especially &quot; etc . , but this is not quite right .
we should talk to the defense of the city .

Global Vo@@ ices , asked about short of editorial : what is the most frequently used aspect on your home site or home country ?
your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , the rum@@ ble of certain parts of the world will be revealed and another fac@@ ets will be displayed .
the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , which lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is written in Japan on most is : &quot; are Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , sorry about Lei@@ d , &quot; I see me . &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan .
depending on the situation , the conversation is taking place , there is a pol@@ ite , interested in its meeting partner , by creating personal questions .
on my clear overview this is usually the default response : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many can@@ adi@@ ans cook perhaps inner before W@@ ut , if they are kept for Americans , but did not stop me .
for someone who don &apos;t know , there is little that differs from the Can@@ adi@@ ans of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans make a Canadian flag very visible at their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans are Canadian .
on the other hand , Americans are ...
it was already , when I started to travel through the world , before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the march of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried out small A@@ hor@@ n@@ sheets on their baggage by their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare system !
there are no weapons !
however , since 2005 , we have been granted legal status in Canada by the same practice ever since 2005 !
everyone seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say very often . &quot;
Canada is supposed to be considered as the toler@@ ability country opposite the ethnic groups .
we are not as this types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I h@@ asse this .
first , I have many American friends , which I have very admired .
it would be nothing that if you would change me for example with Johnny from Dallas by car .
with Marc in Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; cute . &quot;
first , as &quot; nice &quot; referred to as &quot; cute &quot; is basically - as well as the gut@@ ters , gentle , but portable , N@@ ed Flanders , &quot; The Simp@@ son &apos;s &quot; ( which has an own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) .
if Canada really had a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , would be a step forward in fact . but the actual problem is that &quot; kind &quot; does not know . &quot;
there is no corners and edges , nothing , where you encounter .
harm@@ lessly , is un@@ conscious , not very interesting and interesting to earn attention .
that can be something good if one would like un@@ noticed in the background , from the things that pass a around .
I would like to say to say that if the wish is , freely and alone , one of Can@@ adi@@ ans is one of the Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we nei@@ gen to take care of our own business in order to take care of our own business .
what is the same as &quot; nice &quot; design@@ ate , maybe simply can just cool courtesy .
Can@@ adi@@ ans does not speak about the fence with the neighbours .
us missing the warm , open kindness , which I now connect with my American friends .
for luck , for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Jus@@ tin Tru@@ de@@ au was the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just one kind . &quot; our Prime Minister has made clear glass .
music video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one of Thailand &apos;s popular pop band has released a music video , designed the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ ert , which gover@@ ns the power attack in 2014 and to the country still ruled the country in 2014 .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him his friend to him his friend .
although not explicitly stated , the music video is indirectly upon the continuous military coup of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users in their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for this song was a huge success .
within the first three days alone , the star@@ line was split by Facebook high @-@ loaded video 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin Video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked by the public after a group of activists from the public , to view this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai policy , in@@ particular , as it is with the location of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
check out this shots of the video that rel@@ ate to some of the political issues related to Thailand during the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girl &quot; rel@@ ate to the dra@@ con@@ ical Section 44 of the preliminary constitution , issued the commander in Chief of the He@@ eres section about key national issues .
the 11 Rule : &quot; change your setting , &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for &quot; adjustment change &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , political parties and other persons who are viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics .
the picture above is reflected the introduction of the law on computer crime against , whose v@@ age and clear provisions are often used by the authorities to inher@@ ited activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , the online content has been monitored and persons accused of having received the monarchy to have pursued the monarchy .
Thailand carried out a strict ass@@ ert against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Product Information ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war was right in Thailand , on 20 May 2014 .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continue to buy their decision to buy sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security professionals are warning , that the purchase might be unnecessary and a disappearance of taxes .
in the video will be shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before you bring them into an intern@@ ment camp , a further problems .
some journalists sit in prison , because she suppos@@ edly causes the confusion &quot; confusion . &quot; in the society , they have seized long prison sentences in prison , they should revi@@ ved the monarchy .
the songs of the songs showed the songs of the band that was using the Sal@@ ut , &quot; The tri@@ butes of Pan@@ em &quot; from the coup , had already been used by put@@ sch during the protests in 2014 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; I speak to you ? &quot; why do why ?
it is nevertheless a clear ring . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were municipal centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , who were all of the community .
now there is only paved street with twi@@ sts Pra@@ cht @-@ buildings .
people who lived in this place where lived and their contribution to the central part of the Soviet Union in the Soviet Union , have now abandoned the district .

&quot; our mother has forbidden us so that we can photograph photographs , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; she has simply prohibited us , that &apos;s everything . &quot;
the girl fled her gir@@ l@@ friend and suddenly leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small turquoise @-@ mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .

you can convert everything to everything .
many people believe that this buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has actually has to do anything with pl@@ ot@@ ings .
after the war there were hardly work and everyone lived as it was quite right .
I remember that once again , as the city and the war was once . &quot;
when , at the end , there is a little bit over to us , when our conversation is over .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the windows and another boy turns him .
he played with the ball , which then under@@ lined the hills .
a group of children is now seeking to finish the ball .
while they run , there are some of them stones on the left building .
these ruins are part of their childhood that ensure un@@ certainty in its life .
they don &apos;t know it .

in Mexico , &quot; M@@ ama Africa is home to Mexico &quot; Mig@@ ran@@ ts on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez is direc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico .

this article from A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our Partners PR@@ I.@@ org and is written here with friendly permission .
on the road of Mig@@ ran@@ ts , cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located on the border of Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
it is directed by a 59@@ - @-@ year @-@ old Mexico , a small woman with a cor@@ p@@ ink@@ ish color frame and gold tones of coloured rings in Ted@@ dy@@ b@@ ular form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . yet they know many under the name M@@ ama Africa .
this pointed name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather they have become ) a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tian , who are on the passage .
the hotel has rather no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with delicious , fl@@ ashing walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rots in a dairy .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless , hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ ers come here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , tells the people in full small bus and from the top part of the coast , they begin to call : &quot; M@@ ama Africa !
where are you see M@@ ama Africa ? . &quot;
at the time it is rather quiet but in this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also been slaugh@@ tered out in case of cart@@ ons .
you would like to set up ni@@ em@@ anden .
they also helps them , and brings them to the hospital when they are sick of them , they do not pay a drugs that they do not pay them with a bal@@ ances from the long voyage check .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived from a short time ago .
I asked him , whether M@@ ama Africa was a reasonable top name for woman Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebas@@ ti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ cy ) posi@@ ble with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
yes , &quot; yes , &quot; he is responsible for a smile . &quot; I feel it really it is , since African women are very nice women .
very aff@@ ection@@ ately .
she has the heart of a mother ...
we feel very probably &quot; here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister to get to Boston to get to Boston to get her husband and the three children .
they already lived in Brazil , however , it is for some Afri@@ cans that are on the way to the United States , to make a first stop in South America , and then turn to the north .
the family had heard by other members of M@@ ama Africa . &quot; M@@ ama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest of Haiti .
he tells that the Hai@@ tian , and the Afri@@ cans often travels to Africa , and that Afri@@ cans went to Afri@@ cans already on W@@ hat@@ s@@ App by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his works , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil and worked as a construction workers on the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker as the Brazilian economy , he started his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest for M@@ ama Africa for months . he sold SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ ju@@ ana .
for this , I am sending him whether he will contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez on contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; M@@ ama Africa is our mother and let it never let them back , &quot; he will be di@@ mil@@ ing . &quot; we will always stay in contact . &quot;
Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that their guests can send their often text , if they are still gone , to make them into regards to , or to report about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian belief in the drive of their work .
you don &apos;t know much more than Africa , but their guests have brought her , chickens to prepare as in Ghana .
Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps well known , but it is not the only radio hope to travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family won in their little house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to be sold to numerous African Mig@@ ran@@ ts to be expensive .
he has started to help them , a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tian .
some sleep on ceilings on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela says that he knows what the score make .
I lived in the United States , &quot; he tells me . &quot; I &apos;ve experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border on the wilderness , and we crossed the border .
there are places where people can help others and others . that &apos;s why I give my support . &quot;
after having lived three years , he was issued after a raid on his work from the United States .
the majority of migrants , travels across Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , others , also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio C@@ ord@@ ova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez , tells me that he fled in Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to have money back up with him without a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he moved to an accommodation and an un@@ known , a complete stone , has offered him its roof .
a few months later , the family still lives and they tried to decide when the next steps should go .
back in the house of M@@ ama Africa , everything is full of guests again .
in the gears to consult the travel@@ er quiet of your phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has 20 new guests , a majority of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but it is also no@@ stal@@ gic , because of which they have gone .
like a proud grand@@ mother , it sli@@ pped in their album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair , which has made a demonstration in some photos of their gran@@ dd@@ lers and many tourists more , kids and old .
the battle was sad , while she was able to present myself for me .
&quot; Ya &quot; fu@@ eron , &quot; repeat them every time . &quot; she was already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users hi@@ ves the same ...
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic min@@ orities region in the West of China , are forced to install a demonstration on their mobile phones .
on 10 July , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the City of U@@ rum@@ qi sets a mobile phone notification in which it indicates the District government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ wang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
in communication , it is said that the app is to be given access to terrorist information . &quot;
however , the authorities also use the authorities to use the app for more than control of terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because she had shortly after they had replaced the app , news with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the notification of the police , the app is that the sources and the distribution of the terr@@ orists would be and follow , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs Web site describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ wang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Tel@@ ecom .
the main function is the blocking of the web site , by online fraud , Tro@@ ians , and Ph@@ ishing sides , to make user to make users who want to spend on how much time they are online to remotely control the own home network .
this app is intended to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can be used in many different ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state players or even h@@ acker that could be manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or to stand .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while mel@@ ts on digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China , mostly on the experiences of users in the east and south , is the reality very often no@@ zzles for those who live in distant ethnic min@@ ors like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and diss@@ atis@@ faction in conflict areas , the authorities often dissemin@@ ated extreme conditions and surveillance measures , as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ bodied Internet sens@@ ations .
the media based on Twitter based media Out@@ let &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( workers &quot; ) , released messages in China , showed photos from a Check@@ point where the inhabitants of the residents are un@@ solved , whether they had the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people are using the official J@@ ing@@ wang @-@ App .
a mobile notification designed to install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered at a Check@@ point with a device without this software , they may be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a result for the technological development .
you &apos;ve forced the people forced to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity in the rest of the rest technology .
we are back again in Ma@@ os China .
in addition , &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( hi@@ ber@@ ths ) released a J@@ ing@@ wang @-@ product description , from which the software can increase the password for a Windows operating system , thereby prolon@@ ging the access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installing J@@ ing@@ wang , computer and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang are available for electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ wang , possibly a reaction to the instructions of the city party , the diss@@ em@@ ination of illegal content .
all government officials , authorities and research institutions , including universities and research institutes are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office for operation of their computer and communication devices .
a current report from the same House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities issued the authorities on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi , a regulation related to all residents and entrepreneurs as to register its &quot; personal ID cards , phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; in the local police .
the intention is obviously any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroyed . this promotion is not viol@@ ated the personality rights of U@@ rum@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives them to include a whole range of other possible prices , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political communications .
sleep or death , Part 1 : everything returned to death

this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane is his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world you know you and stell@@ ar that you &apos;re far away on a place where everything is gone away .
everything has dissolved after and after dis@@ b@@ anded and a truth that is clear , both of inside and outside .
one , who makes all the honor to their honor .
a list of emotions and press was beaten in a list of emotions and inhi@@ bited no met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if you go back the reality again and you are back behind the scenes , the beautiful scenes and the cre@@ ator - turn the characters in nature of meat and blood , and everything went back to death .
all doubt the doub@@ ts in smoke and you will return to your existence , even if the ground is caught on the axis of the un@@ healed . it is clear that you have caught between the walls , which have their parents , and in front of them your grand@@ parents , stone .
they were arrested and my father three times , but that was not yet , &quot; my lesson , &quot; how the chief of the security of security is formulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he gave his power to us by proof , by giving even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we didn &apos;t know .
five teenagers were torn during a peaceful prompt from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was sufficient to write the city the city for the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; -@@ write .
all city @-@ quarter sought @-@ after , just my own .
for the first time it was still quiet , ra@@ cking , to the wrong time , even if I found no high demands of a city , which is up to the ar@@ ter@@ ies with state security organisms and their comp@@ li@@ ces .
in the third night the things had something experienced , after the power supply heard in the neighborhood .
I broke the silence , by I have several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice through the silence of all .
a few minutes later , some of my friends , some of my friends can be found enough to summ@@ ari@@ ze .
I wasn &apos;t alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we remaining us to a beautiful picture that my expectations have full and filled .
in such a moment you will consci@@ ously aware that you are liber@@ ated from the lamp , but it is interested in the Ger@@ ing@@ est .
I received a call from my father : &quot; If you are ready to meet we meet at the Military Security Council . &quot;
he specified .
then I got the following : no matter how much of honey you go on your voice - nothing can return your voice , after you have made it all the way up to the office of security service from your body .
I arrived there . I arrived there .
with several of his men , Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to talk about : &quot; let me hear me , as you can listen to &apos; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you &apos;re only &apos;re enough to walk enough when we are not nearby . &quot;
his h@@ ull @-@ filled eyes were printed on me .
and you don &apos;t know you to look at the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did , did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood before this building .
perhaps it was on my tor@@ so , E@@ it@@ el@@ ness ; perhaps on the revolution .
I was so confident that I answered , &quot; I have not thought that my voice has already forgotten since yesterday .
and I think I &apos;ve never heard to see you in the eyes , so why should I do it ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such a fatal consequences for me , and yet I have not heard my word from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is in single and his father immediately with it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; his father are immediately with &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gest@@ ank of this dil@@ ated movement is to me till today in the nose .
he was exposed to a &quot; syndrome &quot; , an se@@ es@@ an torture , which I suspended during the months .
on the farm . I searched for the farm .
in the first office , I leave everything back , what I desire to me .
then again through the farm and the second office , leads through a gear to the individual cells .
I cli@@ cked all the details exactly one before I try to the room .
otherwise , they probably have a major cell divided in this time .
I need to share it with only one other political prisoners , and may now be able to wait without any problems .
after some minutes , like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I left a very tried @-@ and @-@ tested communication method : with the Faust at the wall .
I learned that my Z@@ ellen@@ gen@@ ius was a &quot; Er@@ sth@@ ä@@ ft@@ ling . &quot;
after a long time , he said to me .
apparently there was none of the surrounding cells in none of the surrounding cells , which is similar to me , and called the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , there are not a striking facial trains , and doctors are not here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all answers to an existence .
maybe he moved to one of the major cells .
perhaps it is immediately inter@@ ro@@ gated .
the investig@@ ator had insured me , they would be afraid , when I stay .
Lü@@ g@@ ner . Lü@@ g@@ ner .
if I would like to have had a bir@@ ch@@ ann@@ u@@ che in order to pass all these herbs , who like to use the fruit in the garden of my head @-@ lab@@ s .
from the distance I hear them still &quot; All ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; .
it must be about 10 a.m. in the evening ; always with this time , the carp@@ ie , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of the poor , until I saw the yellow light , which brought us the Gra@@ y in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; to 13th S@@ ure of the Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you are here to be inter@@ ro@@ gated here . &quot;
to prevent the secret security in order to protect the state security in order to protect the state security and the terr@@ orists in us , they speak at al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect , so they played their con@@ fession@@ s map and disc@@ lose the close view of its world view .
this is no house that here is no land ; it is a curse designed to transform them co @-@ exist@@ ance to turn the crimin@@ als of her K@@ lan@@ s into a hero .
I wish to hear the hearing and tre@@ ad on Abu I@@ mad , a slender , and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me .
it starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; consu@@ mp@@ ation , despite the visual expres@@ sions , who are still young , you can start your life as much as one thing with your life , as you can stick to demonstrations , and demonstrations you will soon be found . &quot;
I don &apos;t know .
I have to am@@ per@@ ed it to reply .
I really don &apos;t say to say where Bel@@ es , and beats after a friendly interview for me to become an ordinary communication tool .
when and how it happened , was un@@ important .
any voice in me told me that I had to get rid of me , even though I had to get rid of this sentence even though I had nothing to earn this sentence .
at sentence in all of its diversity .
his command is to rip me as much meat as possible by the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ately &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube , probably from the clo@@ d .
your Hen@@ ker took part in your write access .
give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure thee with him and you can &apos;t keep your terror .
my carp@@ ie were still not enough enough for which it did not inter@@ changeable through a cable inter@@ changeable .
when I asked me , I asked me whether the investig@@ ator had been working as a waste collection , or whether it belonged to the normal working position .
they had four cables in@@ each other , to present ourselves , from their sight , great invention of a giant cable .
within a single hour there are three of them from them , while I was still working on the series .
I had lost any sense of my body - and also my voice which I heard this .
the Hen@@ ker noted the cooling and found no means of all over it , which is why he made the next one of an electrically loaded rod .
electricity through my whole body , enough to supply my entire quarter .
my half @-@ naked body , which was punched out on the ground , was the perfect rapi@@ ds .
the Tau@@ ern wall and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he fulfilled his requirement for this night .
that must probably have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep myself to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that my only option was my only option .
some hours went out to me like minutes .
the call to the morning .
the door opens and the morning filled the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
I response with the voice of an exhaus@@ tive young people : &quot; my lord , my Father has to worry , &quot; my Father has to worry . &quot;
&quot; be quiet@@ ly and away you , you will have been moved . &quot;
this was new .
else , they had always released me .
where lead them to me ? !
the j@@ ord@@ an R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b speaks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + Community , free opinion and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b is a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ MAN Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b brings the majority of his time ; it turns out to his computer , and again on his computer , and again on his couch .
but what one can leave however , is a cigar@@ ette between his f@@ ing@@ ers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ hidden lips .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which since 1967 has belonged to the occupation of the West@@ bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family forced to flee their village in Palestine , where they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ ques ( about : farmer ) .
for the past six years H@@ da@@ i@@ b is an passionate activ@@ ist , who puts the majority in the conservative , and their old proven opinions on gender reels , sexu@@ ality and free opinion counts through art and rap@@ music .
with his music , which is often translated with themes , such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation Palestinian poultry . all of these topics will not only be found in his hometown of Amman , but also in cities that stretches from Damascus in Syria to the whole of San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks like a man , who is not too restricted by borders , and he may have suffering a testimony to people who have suffered under the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he is not open , there is no special flags against the US @-@ American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b offers its art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b believes that his co @-@ este@@ em is believed to survive in the war of war , any det@@ our with his identity as &quot; Palestinian poultry ers &quot; - so he was born himself , even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
I don &apos;t think of my own life conditions , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b .
then it adds : &quot; I think , because I am a man , &quot; while he dissolved the nest @-@ café in two cups , it is the holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in this time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise and sunset .
the j@@ ord@@ anic law said that the public consumption of food during the Ram@@ ad@@ an is illegal .
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has made a certain weakness of weakness ; on the other hand , there has a cup of coffee at a sen@@ a hot j@@ it@@ ag with protest against Islam .
generally , the vac@@ ant of warm coffee and the shot of the K@@ ent @-@ cigar@@ ette in the nose is in the first line of freedom .
sometimes , Jordan , like a prison below open sky , especially when you have a view to the neighbouring countries .
therefore , by thus avoi@@ ds it simply to do fundamental things - as in the public during the Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to land not to land .
recently , the Interior Minister Jordan has had a gig on the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some parliamentary elections , that support the Islam@@ ist branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ sus Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , speaks and the main reason for the concert at the concert .
the member and former press release in the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN , that the concert is said &quot; just because of the sexual orientation of the receiver .
many claim that the band &apos;s commitment in matters , such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free incor@@ poration into the Arab world , is endanger@@ ed to dangerous activ@@ ism , which represents the tried @-@ and @-@ tested Leg@@ i@@ tim@@ acy regime in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a the j@@ ord@@ an people as &quot; progressive supporters for Human Rights , &quot; which continue to use &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not simply plug@@ ged Rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually , in fact that a clear crystalline reality is clearly seen in the H@@ da@@ i@@ bs work .
in 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b traditional gender nor@@ ms to Lei@@ be , accompanied by his vision of fate , was formed by vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen Sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a apparently unknown woman whose arms and legs can be found until the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives thanks to hands of which they are actually trust .
in the past years , the number of the &quot; honorary de &apos; was put into the official position outside of Jordan .
Human Rights Watch , according to this high point in 2016 , the number of honorary infrastructure reached its peak ; however , in Jordan , the institutional infrastructure is missing in order to support women , the victims of the murder or domestic violence .
according to a law on the breaking @-@ breaking point of 1954 , women who are exposed to a certain time in prison , &quot; and for their release is often a years of bureau@@ cratic effort , as well as the guarantee of the family necessary that the woman will happen anything .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music is delighted with great popularity and is well @-@ known for it , even before returning to swal@@ lows the country in his country long as tab@@ u g@@ old .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b contest it , however , that his work is politically , however , however , that he is his music , the full of explicitly played on sexu@@ ality , freedom and opinion , not far from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
he was proclaimed , &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;s &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question after the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; there is a focus on poverty .
the list of songs that are on the core in a core .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , a verse often repeated itself :
&quot; you are free , and any other is it too . &quot;
in the course of the songs the H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can get in his words , &quot; what you want &quot; - it is faith or no@@ tices , h@@ ack@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he noted that anyone who speaks in Jordan on the rights of spon@@ dy@@ es and readers and that comments on gender equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were still in use in 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online program RO@@ Y@@ A to remember that his comments were torn out of the context , turns off his opinion .
&quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without a cuts , but has only been a revised version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is open to the Arabic LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that the tolerance in homosexu@@ als do not agree to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ clear , an poet of the eighth century , which still remained today thanks to its homo@@ ero@@ tic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks : when Abu Nu@@ clear who work later on behalf of the potassium work , in the eighth century it was able to write about homosexu@@ ality why in Jordan he did not ?
the actual problem , as H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , or the fact that the concert was said to do .
in the h@@ ash@@ emi@@ tical Kingdom , there is nothing new more that the government attacks on the free opinion dis@@ gra@@ zing and that progressive voices may be brought to the tail .
recently , in January 2017 , the national news service paid several former government officials and members of the teacher , with the accus@@ ation , they had expressed on comm@@ entaries on the comm@@ entaries on the problems faced with the deep in the country .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these great , extra@@ vag@@ ant men d@@ olls are so awesome ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories as regards the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is believed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . there is a further theory that mar@@ ched from the West Japan in the northeast , in order to flee the indigenous people in the region , the Em@@ ishi , into the K@@ nie .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to pay a couple of great places , so we have a great view .
it can only present hard to imagine how big these parts are ...
a new exhibition centre in the capital city , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( liter@@ al ) .
I have been able to see the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two land@@ marks are just seen .
nevertheless , for many people who want to do the trip to A@@ om@@ ori to spend the Neb@@ uta Festival - and still feel a stunning way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was , and I met the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 metre high fixed car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rare , outer appar@@ ition and body care have so important as in this history , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from the crime and to promote a legitimate profession as the hair@@ dresser &apos;s work .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us is the most important port , located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street noise and illegal drug trade are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population was not safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other medium and South American countries - a growing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and the well @-@ thought to copy of famous sporting events such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , has led us that there are more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dressing , that form these complex hair@@ style .
the un@@ parall@@ eled demand for hair@@ s that go to the extreme borders of fantasy and creativity , even has an annual event , which takes place the competition of hair@@ dressing your &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which takes place since 2014 .
there , experts join each other , to show one of them the ex@@ centric wheels can create , as can be seen in the following video ( further videos to current competitions there are on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational facilities such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who found themselves in El Call@@ ao , they found a chance to win their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice to find a training in hair@@ dressing art , which enables them to find work .
motivated by this activity and have seen great possibilities of a lot of young people , that they can take a profession , which is currently in fashion .
in front of the school year , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of its successes :
in 1995 , we were the only professional school in the community and the district , what we are very proud because of love to children , we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letter to guer@@ ill@@ ak@@ azi

the following article is the revised version of the contribution &quot; Liebes@@ kind to guer@@ ill@@ ak@@ azi &quot; which publishes the international online magazine Tea after T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why We write only love letter to people who we know ?
is it not yet much more important , people who feel more to bring to him ?
this question went out to the two young Colom@@ bian and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os by the Young @-@ Youth and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os campaign of the Young Artists Foundation ( Let@@ ters for Rec@@ on@@ ciliation ) to write the young people to write permission to guer@@ ri@@ gs .
it was just a short time ago , her country was setting a historical event , and they wanted to contribute to a peace agreement with the guer@@ il@@ la@@ movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Armed Forces ) , which forms the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the sig@@ nat@@ ories of the peace agreement was considered to be the most important that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel Santos received a Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its in the Nobel Peace Prize .
however , the Colom@@ bian is still a long way , until you can talk about a real reconciliation and of peace .
Guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ ak@@ azi who had lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to war rh@@ et@@ oric rh@@ et@@ oric , and around the clock , they have to integrate their weapons in the life as a civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , in turn again turned to life in constant fear and in some cases deep H@@ ass compared to the guer@@ ri@@ chs had to capture it in their rows and support it into construction of a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian has to close himself and would help in the integration process .
and it is exactly the cities : up to now they have written thousands of young people - love @-@ love to the former guer@@ ri@@ chs struggl@@ es to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign are 6@@ 900 Let@@ ters - one for any former guer@@ ri@@ f@@ law@@ ns , which then personally be handed over to personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day in inspiration for the campaign
the idea for reconciliation of reconciliation was found at the World Summit of Peace Prize , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to talk with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this declared that we love the people that we love , on Valentine &apos;s Day , thousands of love letter , but those forget that they need to be far as far as you need .
he cover he told , he told his love with people who need his love with people , in this year the urgent situation .
this was the plan , letters of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC that will find their place in society and will find a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian Society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a common history of peace in a common history of peace . &quot;
so far the campaign had collected more than 2000 letters within the framework of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colom@@ bian such as Cal@@ i , Mani@@ z@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos; I have never thought that someone would be awarded . &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in a UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the town council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo by the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation in the camp to bring the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC set itself , as they had previously done to take the commands of their leaders .
but this time she received no commands , but letters full of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all participants . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can run in just a few hours - from fear to luck , and everything that is what is &quot; told , &quot; told the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the govern@@ ors of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
after the letters had handed over , led me a former fighter with the camp of the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ al &quot; ( a kind of refuge in which the guer@@ ri@@ chs ) saw living ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ cle he wrote something .
I had to go back , because in addition to him on the bed , a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ werfer , a dead@@ ly weapon in the Dorn@@ rö@@ cker .
I spoke him , and asked him : &quot; Hello , what they &apos;re just ? &quot; he said , &quot; I answer to a letter which has written me someone .
it is a very nice and hop@@ el@@ essly full of letter .
never in my life , someone has never found something to me something , that response to me . &quot; because there was suddenly the tears of tears over the che@@ eks .
I converted him very fixed and continued me next to the Gran@@ at@@ werfer .
perhaps also he was the war , it was tired , all the years of faithful unto this fighting , and wanted to help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had a somewhat different from the life . he was the only way to store him and his six brothers before the famine . &quot; I have never thought that someone would be awarded me for my error .
but now I know that there is outside a company , which is with open arms to us .
until now I have learned to learned how to avoid with weapons .
but now where peace re@@ igns , I can learn many things to learn and do in dignity . &quot;
new vote
there are students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC to a discussion round .
the students were all raised as the war and the F@@ ARC already had already in ob@@ sc@@ urity .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC leader have experienced the history of ide@@ als , ide@@ als and gave insight into their views over the peace process . &quot; now we have the possibility to develop us to a political party , we can contribute to a political party in this country .
for a target of this size , it is worth it to overcome all obst@@ acles , &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
these people were to hear , who had never found a hearing and no campaign that people who had seen as a monsters , and even h@@ assen , only people with beautiful feelings and their environment had been filmed , was very painful for me .
the reality , which lives in the country is me .
but it would go to me that all people - even those who have killed and so much damage have to be brought to us , and give us a smile , and a re@@ arm@@ ing .
many ex fighters have been responsible for letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the arch@@ bishop of the town Cal@@ i , following letter :
column has been made sure that after the de@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation peace would mean peace .
but this is not the case .
as long as it im@@ pregn@@ ation , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , are always ready to use to buy the weapons , and for their rights to use , and this is completely righteous ( ... ) .
we are set up from the F@@ ARC now on peace , to a policy without arms .
therefore , we call all def@@ enders of peace to - regardless of the race , religion , or ide@@ ology , spread over all the land which dreams of a land in the war .
we give you our word to make our contribution and bring to sacrifice , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . who , among us who defend the life as the basis of the existence , many difficulties will be forth@@ coming .
at our way there will be many obst@@ acles , but we will be overcome them .

it is followed by the translation of an article , which was written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ ror , and its first published on the website OC Media took place .
homosexu@@ als and que@@ ens people who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are exposed to a wide range of dan@@ gers , including discrimination , physical violence and sexual violence .
with Schre@@ cks , the reporting of the last months above the persecution pregnant men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , which is like a Dam@@ ok@@ read@@ ed value on the local LG@@ BT@@ Q @-@ Municipality , is not only taken over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny to speak some of their experiences with us and with us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q system in Ch@@ echn@@ ya found the international head@@ lines , after reports that reports were published , torture , torture and murder of men in the Republic of them@@ priv@@ ati@@ zed men .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aja Gas@@ eta ; it threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , suspected of suspected male men and in secret pr@@ isons in poverty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny , and grew up there .
as early as her childhood , they felt that she was a woman in reality .
when they grow , it became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for she was so called to Moscow .
after a group of rel@@ ap@@ ing from the sexual abuse of their land , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
to fear her life , she moved to the United States last year .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day , I was told me that someone need my help .
it was a gar@@ ner@@ ed from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ duc@@ er , who plug in trouble in trouble .
she had no money , so I took them to wa@@ ver .
while I tried to help you , someone made a friend of my documents and widespread them everywhere on the Internet , with my name and a picture of me . he sent it to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following news : &quot; then there is no males more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who can remove this shame ? &quot;
afterwards , the photos taken from my documents through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was just trying to get a few shopping bag from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a lack of men : &quot; here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I turned off , I feel slightly in my body , but I did nothing .
then I heard still a set , but this time on ch@@ echn@@ yan : &quot; how long do you feel the family , you need Sh@@ and@@ fl@@ eck ? &quot;
I don &apos;t know the person .
I know only that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost the awareness and final entries in the hospital again .
apparently , some women had to get everything and started .
the man was fled .
the women had a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two samples in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which nur@@ tures you were placed - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , because my male name is dr@@ unk ; but the doctor stood and put me to the women .
for this , I am grat@@ eful to him very thank@@ ful .
when I got his name for the first time on his leaf@@ let , I got to do with fear , it was a mus@@ cul@@ mination , a Cau@@ cas@@ us name .
but he presented itself as a good man .
I was thank@@ ful for him that he has gone full of me with me .
I spent more than a month at the hospital .
last February I got thre@@ ats .
they returned to me , wrote me - relatives , foreign , foreign , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a alp@@ ac@@ ms .
my family are visited by neighbours and some remote relatives .
the desired , to send me in Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that the everything was a lie .
they ordered the absur@@ d : some told me , I must prove it by using the roads ; others wanted to say that I was not changed in the official television in Gros@@ ny , and I didn &apos;t know my sex I was , and Phot@@ os@@ hop .
I have to say bask@@ ets size C - what would I say in television ?
OC Media : how does your family tries to go with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still difficult for them .
some older people spoke to my mother at the road .
she said to her , &quot; You have brought a monster to the world , that does not only have your family , but the entire Republic .
we can not stir until you , because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she laid up a strike around the neck .
for happiness , the neighbours and ret@@ ains it came to luck .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later stood under the window a car with dark@@ ened window windows and a Num@@ mer@@ n@@ plate with a 95 dr@@ ink@@ plate .
after it happened for the third time , it was clear that there was something bad .
my human rights friends over@@ took the numbers of human rights - it was found that I was pursued .
OC Media : how are you fled ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
out of safety reasons , I will not give their name to its name , but I will say that I am remin@@ ded of them ; they really helped me to me .
with their help I left the country , but then the country was very believ@@ able .
I still cannot understand how it could not be able to realize how it was possible .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to retri@@ eve my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought them , without having to register without a reference , without giving everything .
I broke out my old SIM card and threw them into the waste .
came and check@@ out at the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I plug the SIM card into my mobile phone card .
in the moment , when I call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you think is not about you who get there in security , just because you have left the country ?
our people know you know in which hotel du plug . they even know your room number .
only around &quot; s you have to prove it : it is the number 115 . &quot;
you can imagine how do you imagine ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : stand with your family still in contact ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not hesitate to talk about the sexual inter@@ course , however , this is a Tab@@ u@@ ity .
I still have a few traditional cas@@ us elements , I still have been in me .
so very I wish to wish I wish to overcome this se@@ am barrier , I cannot overcome .
I tell us that , as long as my mother is in life , I will do my best do not to viol@@ ate them .
if we are happy with the camera , I have actually been living out of effort , like the person who say it out of their past - thus saith to my male shape .
but that &apos;s very difficult .
OC Media : know a bit about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who stayed un@@ folds ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington on the last week .
for the need , I needed current information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to somebody there , who eat a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during the Ram@@ ad@@ an did not be arrested and tor@@ tured , however , that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could not wait to wait , and he closed a new shaft .
the most likely they will concentrate on family and transformation .
that I would like to load the relatives in front of those who take care of this problem with the affected person and at the end of require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; by blood gen@@ tu@@ ung .
OC Media : now there are still pregnant women in these secret coun@@ ties ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there are not very many .
when , in particular , those who have no relatives have been relatives or the relatives were left out of their relatives , Kad@@ y@@ rows Court .
as far as I know , they will be taken there , so that they can then present them as terr@@ orists .
that means : if they are taken , you will show their body in television and claim , they would have attacked any village or a military base point .
understand ?
when they were not simply disappeared as these people do not have van@@ ished , rather specifically targeted to radic@@ ally .
OC Media : this is now only a mut@@ ing or have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just want to meet someone who was incar@@ cer@@ ated in Ar@@ chan@@ ger in a half months .
he says that many people had van@@ ished in that prison after their b@@ art had grown .
there was ever since nothing new to them .
they have just taken them .
and this so called Lord , this person was taken part , when these people were taken .
however , until now they were introduced as band@@ its , there was so far not reports . we think that such actions are possible .
why otherwise you would not have this people not allowed to shave ?
know whether these promises and discover@@ ies of people , who are in a so @-@ called &quot; non@@ traditional &quot; orientation , &quot; which took place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I took my hair for the long time .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think , already in 2003 I was already familiar with all of it , when I had lived there - and I never had problems .
!
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria had never applied , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much more safe than now .
Russia wanted to lead us to the civil war , and finally brought us into the stone time .
OC Media : how does it possible to work under the Sch@@ aria Law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were s@@ unk ; I made coloured las@@ hes , bore Roman eyel@@ ashes and short T@@ ops .
the Ministry of Education of Sh@@ aria has never made me a hair only .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several ben@@ ches took place , and the whole city knew ; they were , why men , young people met there .
we have never been revi@@ ved .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a Rede@@ emer : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . this means : &quot; Sp@@ otte does not talk about the evil of any other . &quot;
one says it often to reach children , making it a funny thing .
OC Media : so they simply have their eyes ahead of your eyes , because they believed to believe you would be sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
you never have never done me , never finished , and never beaten never before .
OC Media : how long he kept these Gn@@ ad@@ ens@@ time ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row had entered the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about Mor@@ al in television .
he didn &apos;t talk about us per se , but priority about the behavior of women .
nevertheless , it was possible to change like the people in the city began to change .
who , who , before , and gel@@ atin had eight , considered you on once with Ar@@ g@@ w@@ ohn .
in the period I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could felt like the situation in the Republic .
OC Media : what &apos;s activity now go to ?
Sab@@ rina : I am working as a Win@@ ners .
I deser@@ ved not much - 700 to $ 800 per month , not much in the USA .
apart from that , I still have been active as an active activ@@ ist .
at the moment I was responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communic@@ ates with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we perfectly organize Te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , mer@@ ges , I have to get to hospital and hel@@ mets them to get rid of Ess@@ ence cards .
for a long time , I don &apos;t have any cents .
I discovered these people themselves when I cli@@ cked out of refuge .
I am Muslims and want to help help you need help .
OC Media : wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ bern .
so , nature , that has purely nothing to do anything with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ ens , who want to take you with foam before the mouth , that there is no tail coils .
the Da@@ gest@@ s have what the cab@@ ard@@ iner , which have both Rus@@ sians . they also have what they are - but they are not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I am from there , that is why it is not a pleasant , sow@@ as .
I stayed here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practic@@ ed Muslims who go into the mosque and during the Ram@@ ad@@ an fa@@ sten - live with men .
know , many memory in Tran@@ si@@ ties of men who love men , and they believe that you have to make his family to make more intimate experience . but this is a Tru@@ g@@ land .
these are two different ways - two different types of sens@@ ations to be exact , different life settings .
for me , it is the important thing to feel me in my own skin and not for my body .
not , if I have a partner , or not .
do I &apos;m sorry that I would like to be personally , but my last in@@ time relationship is now already longer than a year .
and I &apos;m not sad , so I don &apos;t know that I am yourself .
local groups war@@ ns against an increase of self @-@ moral within the Arabian A@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last months , there is a strong increase of suicide .
the picture of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning man of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 re@@ te the wor@@ ding situation of Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi &apos;s community in Iran , marked by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i is married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
it was suffering from Ang@@ st@@ zu@@ stands , depression and he failed for his own help , the ability to carry out his family from his family , Ah@@ w@@ azi &apos;s Human Rights groups that would stay in Ah@@ wa@@ z and would remain anonymous .
a set on YouTube split video kept the moments when he ign@@ ited himself .
some people were able to ext@@ ingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ is@@ i was taken into the Tal@@ eg@@ hani hospital in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
local sources it was so strong that doctors have nothing to do anything .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ minority , and activists before place war@@ ns against that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights reports that this month some other - H@@ amid Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ay@@ awi Fal@@ ah Mou@@ ss@@ awi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tami@@ m - will be hang@@ ed .
their stories have a thing in common : we were all the family fathers , who lives in due to the persecution of the Iranian government , hil@@ s , and in@@ able , their families to feed their families and secure work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , which is most of the most important of the Iran , Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi &apos;s community , was raised by a deep economic crisis , which makes it heavily affected in the native Arab population to contest their living conditions .
in front of a century , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was an autonomous region of Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy took over power and made great efforts to finish the ethnic aut@@ onomy throughout Iran .
in Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the greatest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the portable and valuable surfaces for Iranian agriculture .
despite this valuable resources , regional economy continues only slowly , and the native population gets only little of that wealth .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and discover@@ ies .
the Iranian regime returned to Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ Ara@@ bern &apos;s jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also has a variety of wires , the water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and Gh@@ om .
these things have been led to destroy this D@@ äm@@ me which resulted in the area through a drying resulted in the area and the local agriculture as well as the fish and pal@@ ms of pal@@ ms .
the unemployment rate below the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi @-@ adol@@ esc@@ ents increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of co@@ operatives , work and social prosperity , reports that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who finished the primary school , 55 % had a further leading school and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the Spirit of national resistance . &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , a Iranian human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and ra@@ cial ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high increase in the number of self among the young Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ male .
Do@@ him@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of attacks in Ah@@ wa@@ z , and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
since function@@ aries and institutions are preferred to adjust the Arab labour force , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi grows to access to work@@ stations in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the Spirit of national resistance of young Arabs , to destroy their living outside of their hometown Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to hide their ancest@@ or name , to hide their accessibility to Ah@@ w@@ azi , as even the Arabic name is not toler@@ ates , because the speaking of the Arabic language or the Tra@@ gen clothing .
in view of the given circumstances which fight the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi , the human rights activists will explo@@ ged before the situation explo@@ sives .
it remains to wait in the world , wake up the world up and how to know it .

the following article is a revised version of the opinion that was written by A@@ yo@@ mi@@ de , and was originally published on the site of Af@@ ro @-@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions , in which many different positions came to an expression .
you can read in the commentary text under the original text .
when I say that I am not femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who have themselves as inter@@ se@@ eded Fem@@ ini@@ sts - with Fr@@ ust .
you get rid of why I am not part of the movement .
you can even put together scientific and social arguments about me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally speaking all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , in spite of the same education , women still earn less than men in spite of the same education .
that women are still under strict observation , if necessary , what they may make your body with their body .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or so that cultural and social nor@@ ms are still ensuring that women so@@ oner or later in various fields of life participated in a g@@ inal ceiling , and that discrimination on the gender can still be spread across the many different countries and beli@@ efs .
all this is aware and known .
I am convinced and I felt twice and three times .
I am a black woman .
and nonetheless , when I say to skin art , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q or black women from the Di@@ as@@ por@@ a ; if I have chosen , what kind of understanding , se@@ eks , and burnt al movement , there were many white fem@@ ini@@ sts and white inter@@ se@@ perate fem@@ ini@@ sts .
however , all women are all that women - all women - come together to go to &quot; their vote , and &quot; Kum@@ b@@ aya , &quot; my lord &apos; to sing , &quot; to reach the equality ( some of the women ) .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about it that in addition to sexual violence , there is a institutional form of ra@@ alized violence that we are exposed to two different species .
or beyond that black women and women of other eth@@ ics and women of other ethnic groups and women are less than white men and women .
the black girl and girls with a migration background more often than white girls , due to obvious reasons .
or that women in black sp@@ ies and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk , and violence and violence in the partnership as well as white women .
on the one hand , I want to have all men , all men and all men . on the other hand , I can hear me as a black woman not able to take into account the white woman who refused to account for both the sex as well as to the skin of a person .
I am er@@ ect and I will not want to fight with me in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere , which brought me and countless other black women and again .
in 1851 So@@ jour@@ ner started his speech in 1851 in her speech : &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; and I have wei@@ ght@@ ful me to jus@@ tify an idea of ide@@ ology in the black woman in historical respect to an isolated and mar@@ g@@ inal beings .
I jum@@ pers me to join me group@@ ings that also absorb our customs and customs , in order to stri@@ ve your eg@@ o@@ centric program .
I will not try to try white women on the importance of over@@ lap of skin and sex . because some of them will continue to recover the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to leave them one better .
although the inter@@ se@@ ed@@ ale femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women different materials and a home from a white femin@@ ism , which is still the word &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; in his name .
I &apos;m afraid , and all of the femin@@ ism will join me , and my status of femin@@ ism , which was called upon me as a white @-@ femin@@ ist Para@@ dig@@ ma , which is hard to use for a white @-@ femin@@ ist Para@@ dig@@ ma , which is so hard to be celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before we define the black women to our own ideas and we are looking forward to us from us to us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson - We@@ ems , the author of the book of Afri@@ c@@ ana , says : Rec@@ or@@ ing O@@ ur@@ selves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we are able to create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , se@@ eks , physical and even the spiritual elements could be admired , which account for the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ modal fem@@ ini@@ sts are immediately read , after they read them read about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradic@@ tions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman are affected .
in a v@@ os@@ an@@ ist environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this Para@@ dig@@ m , I have existed .
I am recognized due to my dark skin , and due to my existence , as part of this Para@@ dig@@ mas .
I , a black woman can bloss@@ om in a environment , in which my life does not survive , nor rejected , nor rejected .

the following article is the shortened version of Article &quot; The shaft of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the number # Por@@ j@@ er ( # Para@@ lich@@ ter ) , who reported about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most of the names were changed to protect the people .
a police Commissioner , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , said they were nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their ex@@ partners who had been violent as a violent company .
since the end of its relationship , a bit of time passed , and the police said , their statement would not do , but no more could do not do .
one of the other Mrs. Bal@@ bu@@ ena due to mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , useful the acute display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez nothing .
a few days later , the second woman moved their display .
the Teu@@ fel@@ lowship of violence against women is difficult to break .
if women is ref@@ und@@ able at all , you will not receive any support by the State .
in many cases , women are financi@@ ally dependent on the men that they are related to women . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit the victims of violence that have been victims of violence .
In@@ cre@@ 1 stro@@ kes and Statisti@@ cal 2 Un@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ ches and an legal system that nothing do not under@@ ing 3 t@@ ays law : good approach , lack of implementation and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really har@@ assed at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that are not once ans@@ wering the extent of the gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
however , the numbers are available . however , the numbers are available .
in 2015 , the State At@@ tor@@ ney &apos;s Office owned by the At@@ tor@@ ney &apos;s Office 9@@ 600 . of which 70 % of them went up violence against women .
only 86 % of the advertis@@ ements in the police came from women .
there was more than 5,000 advertis@@ ements in the peace violence among peace violence . here , 86 % of the advertis@@ ements were women .
in the ads , 40 % of women that they were post@@ ulated , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
these statistics show however not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the data of the par@@ agu@@ an Women of State , Ana Bai@@ ardi will actually appear only a few of these criminal cases . &quot; on every woman who will not be ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic missions , 9 women who do not do this .
on every woman who is ref@@ unded for physical mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , two women who do not do so , &quot; stated the end of 2014 .
as women &apos;s murder in Paraguay are no own tuning authorities , the complaint is not appropriate to document how many women have been murdered every year from their current or former partners .
until August 2016 , journalists spent at least 12 cases of women in the country alone .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , all ten days in Paraguay all ten days spent a woman due to violence against men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and an legal system that keeps nothing .
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z , the fixed gir@@ l@@ friend of Carlos Vera , it insist@@ ed on that they called the name of all their former friends .
at the beginning , she was not really not yet , but , however , after that . this should be one of them for ever .
today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos together . but for two years she bore the psychological violence in one part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult ones :
I have never thought that I would have been victims of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
if I have read more about it , I thought that only women happens to be dis@@ counted that only women affected by violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana took social media to report about the missions of Carlos Vera .
without any name , she wrote a posts on Facebook , in which they described his Bel@@ ei@@ c , and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told them , as he had isolated .
many people interested in their contributions , including Carlos even . he asked the rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically , whether he ever made his hand against them , and refused to be a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users , Mari@@ ana , why they didn &apos;t like that so long from Carlos I had left him , and didn &apos;t left him earlier .
it seemed almost as they wanted to say that the victims of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment were at least a certain co @-@ school .
Victoria Santos , which did not come from Paraguay , fought in Paraguay nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner they had been har@@ assed .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I think you &quot; ) who is composed of women who are in any way of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
in the group , they can talk to other experiences over their experiences , listen to each other .
do you do what many others do not do : they take the statements of the women .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case all started with psych@@ ic missions .
her prosper@@ ous partner had finally managed to convince them that they were valuable .
he began to beat her .
Vict@@ ori@@ as ads during the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
she led a trial against their former partner who developed to an un@@ mistak@@ able legal fight between Paraguay and its home country , mainly in money , power and the influence of their former Partners .
th@@ reading laws : good approach , lack of implementation
there are many laws that are very good , but not to be applied .
the display of missions is a way full of resist@@ ors and a struggle against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for women in Paraguay , looks great problems at the application of the laws in the country .
on August 10 , 2016 a bill was discussed under the h@@ agu@@ an Parliament under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ E@@ llas ( # Für@@ th ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , which is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law sees how to explain Fe@@ mi@@ cide on a stand @-@ standing pen@@ sion@@ ate and harder , as it was already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legislative text was changed in some points but also the MP@@ s to win the law that would be banned in Paraguay that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of sample descriptions were forbidden in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill that had been planned for most of the ( bureau@@ cratic and economic ) travel costs which have to be present at present themselves if they just want to enjoy and secure the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law does not exist , if the legislature is not effective when the legislature is no proper financial funds provided at your disposal :
in Paraguay mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of human relations .
here is a change in memory , so that violence did not be more than anything else .
wh@@ osoever den@@ ed in view of these facts , ple@@ aded not guilty , and bears that the perpet@@ rat@@ ory is coming .
we have to refund this long display , until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer regarded as normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted by the par@@ agu@@ an Senate . prior to the law , parts of the law had been changed . among other things a passage level , which was called the partners in cases of the reconciliation of reconciliation .
the opinions about the changes are apart .
the section concerning the reconciliation of reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the Ag@@ gres@@ sor , his sacrifice again .
the words of the words &quot; gender , &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual abuse &quot; from parts of the law applies however as a great return .
this article is the shortened version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the number # Por@@ j@@ er ( # Para@@ lich@@ ter ) , who reported about the violence against women in Paraguay .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
Ran@@ j@@ it &apos;s Club 2016 in Zambia , image is carried out in Zambia .
medical research in Africa is not mentioned in the media only rare or even not mentioned . this is in order to address a growing area that make one of the urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the needs of local medical research , there are two reasons : for a missing on the offer of global health , many medicines and vacc@@ ines , which cover the specific medical needs on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria in the po@@ o@@ rest countries of Africa far more extensive effects as elsewhere , and lack of investment for the investigation of these diseases are a great problem .
secondly , research , which is conducted by African scientists itself , with its establishment of a research capacity in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be facilit@@ ated for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it &apos;s director of the Central Center for the exploration of Inf@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ology in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew in the 1990s at Lus@@ aka , Zambia , in the 1990s , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a degree in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he participated in the HIV virus before he decided to go home to home to support the economical health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. med has discussed over the future of medical research in Zambia and over mis@@ understanding of the media about these research .
( disc@@ laim@@ er : Dr. med ) speaks as private people ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it &apos;s RW for the moment is the main focus of my work on the application of research results . supporting the most economical national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I have just got a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion about the important current science topics in your country and generally in Africa ?
how they differ from them in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research research here . we are only put solutions that have been differently .
that must change , otherwise , we will always stay for the receiver , rather than yourself M@@ acher .
the solutions that we get , are often used in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use here .
g@@ v : where is the financing and support ?
is they sufficient ?
how simple or difficult it is , suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
projects are well supported .
it is difficult to find people who come back or here , because the financing and development chances are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obst@@ acles are available in your routine work , which you did not had previously ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs plenty of money , a continuous power supply with electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it lasts for months to import from other countries .
g@@ v : how is the opinion of the public on science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interested but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools in order to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how big is your opinion after the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should focus on demand , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age classes .
there are requirements of special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of the world , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and increasing ) and efficiency of traditional medicine are very profit .
g@@ v : can you describe the fore@@ - and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientists in Africa across Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often , there are the limited speed , things to do , and the ability to scientific expertise gained here .
the system that magazines can only be accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , limited also the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers of global food production .
this post of Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally reported on the website En@@ si@@ a@@ .com , a magazine which reported on the basis of environmental problems in the world .
Frank Mort@@ on zü@@ chtung since the 1980s in the USA since the 1980s .
his company offers 114 varieties such as Out@@ red@@ den , the first plant that has been cultivated by NASA astr@@ on@@ au@@ ts in the space space .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on work was only allowed through its own random number and question how many Sal@@ at@@ ables can get borders .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he observed that more sal@@ ts were patented , so that they could not use the bre@@ eder .
the patents do not only have individual varieties , but also for specific features such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or we@@ eds leaves .
over the past years , more of such patents have been registered over to more plants such as grain or anti@@ ot@@ ten@@ ants . due to this trends , Plant @-@ based plant @-@ protective , environmental protective and expert for food safety for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a millen@@ nia , Mort@@ on still re@@ side salad , he needs to do longer , since his work is still being continued with more restrictions .
it is , when it would be a b@@ oul@@ ders in a river , around which I have to stum@@ bled .
so , we have to do this , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that this patents will go to Sal@@ ate .
and if they hold a court , no one cannot miss a new Sal@@ at@@ eries , because all features are patented . &quot; he makes so good as possible and trying to re@@ aring those features .
however , it is very careful and stri@@ ve to use , no material that is protected as a geological property .
he also joined a motion , which is always larger in the USA , and anywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; trains ) .
astr@@ on@@ aut of the International Space Station ISS have bred red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at the train station &quot; the station is bred and eaten it . there will be tested whether plants can be found in the space space .

it is not a co@@ incidence that this name is rather as so , the movement of the IT sector origin@@ ate and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed &quot; ) can be inspired by the motion for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to this protected software .
it was launched to life in order to ensure that some plant species and fish are not protected as a non @-@ term property and can be used for plant breeding .
as part of the initiative , short O@@ ss@@ i , as part of the initiative , US Zü@@ ers can commit to do so that other that do not have to use seed seeds .
this means that they do not continue to make business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eder allow up their seeds , to cross it their own varieties , and it does not agree with two aspects that are banned by many plant pat@@ ente .
dozens of bre@@ eder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014 .
nozzle : &quot; no@@ zzles &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the em@@ ination of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i member , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seed and the possibility of hal@@ ving new plants , both important for food safety and environmental protection .
seeds play a role in major con@@ junc@@ tions such as Bio@@ diversity , rights of peasants , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eder would try to use the latter only or just little to use , by taking plant seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ised that the &quot; Open Source &quot; movement does not work with gene@@ tically modified plants .
all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetable , Kor@@ n , gene@@ tically modified and sustainable vegetable consumption , which is why in August or September 2016 , we would like to be offered on a farmer &apos;s markets , should we know that the species is bred , as this vegetables is bred .
the nutri@@ tion@@ ity without seeds is not possible . &quot;

O@@ ss@@ i supporters believed that the future of food supply are endanger@@ ed , since the available gen@@ pri@@ ze@@ pool was due to the always @-@ wide @-@ sized mental potential to plant breeding material , which therefore still be reduced , non @-@ reduced detail .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , Director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her thesis with gen@@ etic Vari@@ ation at car@@ rots and their availability . it found out that about a third of all Kart@@ ot@@ ten@@ ant features are protected as a non @-@ legal property , making it not use@@ able for plant breeding e@@ ders .
for other plants , such estimates are still not yet , but experts , like Lu@@ by suggests that there are plants such as wheat in even larger style , are salad or car@@ rots .
a question of Visi@@ ble
plants are cultivated so that they are specifically targeted features - from such , due to their taste or their color , because of which they keep in certain environments , thri@@ ve and thre@@ ats as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of Pat@@ ents on plant properties show that the available plant material for bre@@ asts through more patents . genetic variety is currently than ever before , since the changed conditions are pre@@ di@@ visible with climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ speaking in Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to that genetic diversity is important and important for Mon@@ san@@ itation activities . with a total of four genres banks and the cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States , the company responsible for the preservation of genetic diversity .
however , it says the view to promote other bre@@ eder , since &quot; patents and the protection of plant professionals . &quot; a patent is basically a patent pending , which is followed by the patent for the previous year .
often , these instructions can help others to come with another method to reach the same result .
such protection inhi@@ bits innovations , but does not support it by the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mort@@ on looks like the different : 20 years , until a patent sequ@@ el , conve@@ yed no innovations .
and if you have to wait so long , to plants with plants , which are adapted to the modified environmental conditions , if one could have lost the fight .
the main house for Mort@@ on is however , that genetic resources are always good to use : &quot; independent plant breeding e@@ ders have neither the time even the money for such form@@ ality , and mon@@ et@@ ching An@@ rei@@ ze are not attractive for us .
we want to facilitate farmers and facilitate farmers .
this is what we rub@@ bing , and it will be impossible to use us if we do not continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot;
in total , Mort@@ on participated in the concept to patented plant features : &quot; we don &apos;t create the characteristics not really .
the plants constitute them out of and as a bre@@ eder we finally gave up the idea how the plants do do .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding , in the US state of Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i member , there are another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; those who bear a variety with her own values in it .
those who believes in industrial agriculture with large underground and mon@@ ocular sho@@ cks , which are needed for their growing her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , the farming has re@@ aring its varieties in agriculture in its varieties .
my concept is exactly skilled . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are to move on international markets , but is smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) - either rests her smaller seed companies - either rests her , or hold it for too expensive and therefore it is not worth@@ while or both is the case .
the independent plant bre@@ e@@ ders Frank Mort@@ on is looking for in its breeding garden Sal@@ ate .

Mort@@ on is also the conclusion that the g@@ athers of plant pat@@ rol innovative would be : &quot; it looks like to produce new efforts to produce new , more than ever before .
I need to do a permanent new material for my catalogue , because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent is being protected from competition , where it is pretty easy for about 20 years . &quot;
although the United States seem to be the &quot; open source &quot; breeding leaders appear in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding leaders in the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture , &quot; which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed programme and helps them to re@@ build new varieties in order to produce new varieties .
it also supports them to sell &quot; Open Source &quot; seed &quot; and sell their own .
the German organization Schu@@ col operates at an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; license which eventually formed a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i commitment to the bre@@ eder in the European Union .
( regulations for the bre@@ asts ) differ from country , which can not be taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world may not be taken over . )
in early November 2016 , the Executive Board of the European Union , the European Commission declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , the patents will be bred to conventional plants .
however , a statement is not yet a law ; now it is to implement the governments of the Member States to implement the Patent Office , this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed and seed companies from all nation@@ alities , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards sponsor@@ ship of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s programme for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems that the organization is currently building a global alliance of &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for the scheduled next year of the official starting year .
a merger of environmental protection and development aid groups , including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organization , including Hi@@ v@@ os , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) , has put a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , Global Alliance has published a report for the future of food aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and other - a report that farmers have to exchange on seed companies and improve the seed policy , thus ensuring a stable supply with food .
in the report , the importance of a varied , local supply with seeds for the food systems also emphasises - a connection to recognize the Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that it will be able to know more people .
the movement for regional and ecological food has to be played , where , and seed systems have hardly ever played , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are trying to make people interested in people who is more than their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of the c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
still alive the Egyptian authorities have been involved in the Internet .
this time met the site of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column .
on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government adopted the website of the European Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt , and the Arab world .
in August , the network announced an opinion on Facebook that cri@@ tici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step , cri@@ tici@@ zed the work and efforts to go on human rights in the region .
the &quot; Network for Human Rights Information Avail@@ able - in spite of these statutes and to give to a voice in the Arab world , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI is confirmed that all technical possibilities will be performed in order to overcome the sper@@ sing and not to be . we be@@ har@@ ren to meet our task .
AN@@ H@@ RI is regarded as the first major website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after which the authorities left out more than two months 21 websites , including Qatar @-@ language version of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar @-@ based network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era .
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation on the wave of Web@@ se@@ ws and victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i a major data sources for Human Rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
next to AN@@ H@@ RI , there is also no access to the blog of the Colom@@ ni@@ sts and human rights , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the diss@@ em@@ ination of Kolum@@ ba and articles that he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog , he was addressed to avoid the Z@@ ens@@ ur@@ ation of the Egyptian government , even the goal of a attack .
B@@ logger , the provider of which is native to Zi@@ adas blog , is on the other hand , is also accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he participated in the student of a student , such as the police violence against two students .
his article is turning mainly to politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook commentary , Zi@@ ada went to the Sper@@ ing through the government and reflect what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs to sper@@ m is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the lock of the blo@@ gs is not important for the world , it is not important for me for me :
1 ) It has succeeded to communicate with me the feeling of a siege to nature ; A arrest , a attempted murder , pre@@ loading in the national Security Council , the Sper@@ ing Blo@@ gs as well as every other website , for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I wrote not in any other words . in other words : my words have influence , even only to a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used to avoid the c@@ ens@@ orship for the post of articles .
now , after having locked him , and that they were afraid of the words , I still change the link or to create a second blog .
the mud go out the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Human@@ ity and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this produced technical tests in the different Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , including orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Eti@@ sal@@ at .
AF@@ TE documentary also documented the sper@@ from providers of inter@@ grid @-@ c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( VP@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12 we will notice as the Sper@@ ing of websites , which began VP@@ N@@ s began .
such practice indicates that the government &apos;s intention to operate content to block contents , and to filters that Egyptian users could have access to Egyptian users .
the situation will be made in addition to the fact that the Z@@ ens@@ ur@@ ia can be made behind it , so that the Egyptian population has no legal situation , which they can pre@@ di@@ ct against this actions in court .
now the question : as far , the Egyptian government is ready to go with the c@@ ens@@ orship and wen she will mature as the next attack ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants are disputed .

during the report on newspapers in Brazil , the head@@ lines made from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous posters .
some of these head@@ lines are like :
in school , &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old was shot in school , &quot; each day is murdered by a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; Di@@ eves rau@@ se pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air af@@ ee after Rio . &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis , in the middle of the economic crisis , the violence threshold in Rio reached the highest level since 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called the United Nations to access the United Nations .
reports like these are daily , and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
thus , for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio well @-@ known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16th August , &quot; which is not normal , &quot; in which they announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motifs for their decision declared the newspaper :
extra will continue to report on crimes committed in every major city on the world , as murder , Rau@@ b , sexual crimes , etc . all that happens during the &quot; war &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our kind to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative to close as journalists as journalist not close our eyes in front of the Greenland .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , chief editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , that this decision was no reason for pride , but rather a sign of the failure of the failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper on the world with a war@@ d@@ bri@@ k in a country which does not recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that it will be controlled according to the information of the institute for internal safety in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas that will be controlled by criminal organisations .
in the gui@@ ding article , the newspaper continues :
it is aware that a war dis@@ course , when he is broken , the police can only use the police , such as the police that only use , and then ask questions to for@@ wards .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civil population , but the economic power of M@@ af@@ ia and its partner .
sch@@ a@@ waiting the designation &quot; war &quot; more than they are used ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil argu@@ ed the journ@@ alism of the Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira . this is the opinion of a right @-@ term security policy through the media and could change it to control the police .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - such as Extra at the analysis of military personnel in Rio himself - in combination with inadequate investments in personnel , education , and a historical and self @-@ educated deteri@@ oration of the public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just his capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the violent place in Brazil , &quot; is wrong , according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil , according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
when we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per state , Rio is on place 16 , &quot; writes it .

to these security measures , the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the state of Rio in 2003 was established by the state of Rio in 2003 whose goal is to take a Fav@@ ela to conquer and a unity permanently .
at the beginning , this was in fact to a decrease in violent deaths . for several years , the U@@ PP , but after several reports on Schi@@ kan@@ es and repres@@ sion against the poor congregations , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux made from one of his article from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio do not correspond to the name &quot; Civil War &quot; through the Geneva Convention .
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also moves serious consequences for human beings .
for this , it calls for a state which are typical for a war , which is typical for a war . it belongs to the territory of a &quot; fine of &quot; where a civil point is an invisible point in the landscape and to the object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al@@ ous damage &quot; and &quot; ver@@ ir@@ te balls . &quot;

since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from the siege of siege to the siege , mainly by the Assad regime .
according to the victories , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ ei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege .
particularly heavily affected is the East Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons caused the life of hundreds of thousands of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition will go out , based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organizations that the massacre committed against the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these reb@@ els from rebel @-@ controlled areas outside of Damascus under the siege , which led to those inhabitants are concentrated or through tunnel and control points , both by tunnel and control points .
due to the years of long block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat has become in@@ accessible for large parts of the population .
in counter@@ point , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ mics for the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can produce their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ se@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not among the traditional , in Syria planted food and are only very rare part of the Syrian cuisine . its nutritional value , however , makes it an attractive food source for many fat@@ alities of besieg@@ ed east Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ tion of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said opposite the French news agency AFP :
we opted for the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutrient value , similar to the meat , and because they can plants in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers &quot; Global Vo@@ ices , has been committed to fight this project for three years now and pressed its relief from that it is now gaining more and more . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , you use in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ se@@ da &apos;s humanitarian crowd platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to create 125 families of knowledge on the reproduction of mushrooms , such as Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they achieved more than 100 % of the expected target of around 12.@@ 700 € , but will continue to gather at Can@@ Do as Monday , September 4th , 2017 .
the initiative is based on altern@@ ators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the fuel consumption , the fuels used are used locally , to supply generators with necessary energy .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said , Global Vo@@ ices , that it started using production from the regions of fung@@ al , &quot; before they over@@ taking their quality and , whether they are suitable for consumption .
afterwards they were planted with a small fung@@ i in a pan . when this was used , they used a bigger pan . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; Lehr@@ yard yard for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a declared that it is part of a larger movement .
we want to bring the people the fung@@ us for various reasons , &quot; the breaking of siege .
provision of a new food source in the market .
diss@@ em@@ ination of a culture of self @-@ care for food ( such as paper , tea , coffee kit , cardboard , etc ) can be used to determine new food .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work on home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities , which are bound at their home .
he said , &quot; we hope to spread this idea in the whole world , so our success and our fight against hunger and the siege is visible .
we want to help our experience in crisis areas , and we can help mankind . &quot;

to these problems , there will be added that the website of civil protection of Portugal on the 15th and 16th October , when they were sought for information or trying to contact persons .
it was a private initiative that said the population with information : they used the own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina . this was the decisive weekend in October , so that the server was followed by the end of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires erup@@ ted , but the site became more than half a million access .

two years earlier , a ven@@ erable civil war was broken between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group , which had defeated a short @-@ term pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan has become a country of the terr@@ ors and the branch .
at this time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati was a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan , for the last time together with his family together .
even if his mother did not go back then , so knew it knew that they would not see her son very long - maybe even more .
the boy was breaking to break the boy .
his unc@@ le would take him and bring him to the Schle@@ p@@ res .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , who has dominated by Haz@@ ara &apos;s Party He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , had just been murdered by Tali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara .
the Tali@@ ban known Tali@@ ban came closer to their hatred on the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Tali@@ ban came closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af took place in Pakistan .
a few years he worked in a Koh@@ leg@@ ru@@ be . work was difficult and made him sick .
then he began what was left out of his low wages , and went into Iran . once again , he was engaged in a foreign country along with other refugees and tow@@ ed bags with mort@@ ar which were he@@ avier than he himself , in order to earn his life .
at that time , as today , the lives of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was min@@ ted by El@@ end and exploitation .
it was really hard , &quot; remin@@ ded of an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in a blank building on the building site , on which we also worked .
there was there no services any services and no heating . we are hanging nylon that we did not return on at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af gave his life without papers in Iran behind it and made himself ready for journey to Europe .
when the dangerous journey on the sea suffered a ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ ded on a small , inhabited island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum , A@@ shar@@ af was born in 2002 to Italy .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af @-@ homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , close to the parks , and went to a church , which was put twice on the day of food .
it is true that Italy was due to relatively high @-@ cash flow rates for the past asylum seek@@ ers . it is true but also that the conditions which include asylum seek@@ ers in the country , cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c .
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system is suffering under a general lack of transparency .
the large majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special shooting centers . &quot; it &apos;s about many facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and non @-@ prepared staff . &quot;
according to Italian law , Asyl@@ um can only be divided to a recording center , when they have officially put an application for asylum - which may apply for asylum on the registration of asylum seek@@ ers .
until then , people who have no money for an accommodation , either to the hospitality of friends , or to sleep on the road .
there is also A@@ shar@@ af , which will also be A@@ shar@@ af .
but its un@@ certainty life helped A@@ shar@@ af , to release soon from these conditions .
after having made several years in construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af had his entire savings to the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that he opened a second hostel and a sn@@ ug@@ i , opened after a while .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject to the &quot; handicapped in Venice luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by directors Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italian - are very difficult .
much bureau@@ cracy , high taxes and conditions for loans only are some of obst@@ acles .
according to official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans are living in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of Afgh@@ ans operated companies , including cutting , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some af@@ gh@@ tly restaurants were praised even in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iter and the kitchen operators are mostly refugees from various parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurants tells through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the story of their trip to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals are very far beyond the Italian Gastr@@ onomy business and the Retail Banking and aims to leave the country that he had to serve as a teenagers camp .
&quot; where is an risk of the risk , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forget my country , and I cannot live happy if I know that my people are suffering .
I cover a project for farmers from the po@@ o@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of the society and have to get the same opportunities as all others . &quot;
A@@ ring is also plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , in which the people of packaging and preservation techniques can learn . &quot; so , they can improve their appointment on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of the successful entrepreneurs was a journey through un@@ certainty , and doubt , but at the end stand stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he would like to help other Afgh@@ ans on this way .
