<seg id="1">Although I visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would live for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is very large.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American films, I have read American music, American authors and his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a great deepening effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican's student, with the help of YuRoberts, a oil magnets, who wanted to make his interest with judges with judges who wanted to make his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to Method Man, "I was" s, as if the absolute truth is, reiss anything else, that's what I want to make with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, had only been intensified for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country in which I ever lived as welcoming, that you can always be able to find that you are and there is slightly acceptance in a community of equal people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very shaking-love letter over his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then, Donald Trump came to Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has been written over the tourist interest and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of its climb is suitable for me, as he goes with his Engines.</seg>
<seg id="15">He holds out of his opinion behind the mountain, as you say so nice.</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells the right of what he think, as a former colleague it spoke to him, and explained his interest for Muslims, Latinos, Afro American and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people still reacts on his statements and for affiliation for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, which he won in the Republican Presidential election, was the highest number made by the party of nominated candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was in English.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are Americans who wanted to support this kind person, I asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could get Trump and his voters not work with people in line, which I had met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, the people from all over the world, with whom I managed to talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also voted Trumps World Victory of Peter Bhatia, the present publisher of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had met us with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours so that "Phoenix Sus" had to play in the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance stands also in contrast to the generosity, which I struggled at Sandy Bahr, who fights for her life for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me as their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fit it to the commitment of Kristi Kappes which, always with lots of patience and sacrifice to me, and my colleagues helped us to get to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then, Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus, and Retha Hill, my mentors who helped me with my career with my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those who are embodied in their love by them in love with them.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump abandoned its way to the nominated republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that it was the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans spent over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of its debt to non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The conflict with the idea that people had come for Trump, because they shared either his racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to see these things, me broke out almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it is unfair the Trump-voters as Rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">People include the person, said one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is surface-faced and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who are on a different way and memory.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and freest over the hectic changes did not be taken into their municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of which most know are, for Trump, because she would like to win the control over a country that they disappointed it?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they wanted to say that they are still important in that America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can't forget to go to the words of David Rememaking, who comments the cruel decision to watch a man who look at home to those who look different.</seg>
<seg id="41">These "Whitelash" (pm.).: as "using the White against all other Ethics," word from white in detail on the White and whiplash, which means how the big Van Jones called it, has made exactly what was about America so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">The American ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - what faith or in the background you can always have any welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">Because this country chosen as its President, twice the son of a Kenianers, whose story, as he says, nowhere else, anywhere in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, with the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white Americas. this promise to hell, freedom of religion and the whole term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the America after 9 / 11, the white man is back again on the rest of the rest.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all I have to think of Khizr Khan, the Father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump," could have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America? "asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The quantity responded with a quiet "Nein!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "Muslims defeated a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" brood for the quantity.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" Latinos has a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "they answered them." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"No!" she finished and their voices were photographed.</seg>
<seg id="56">If someone could not like you, one place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="57">He got a unanimous and quiet "NEIN!"</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan finished his words: "God is thanks, Mr. Trump, is not your Second World." 36 hours later he was revoked.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is now Trumps country, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all people who look like Mr. Khan, could no more place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And this breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguan town of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music that has played at both locations, is not only the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music, which lives with waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, just 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; a old colonial city that is very popular among tourists, but Worlds removed from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now the La banda de MÃºsica (Music bande) has now been playing in the church: an old of children and adults of existing symphonie Orchester, which has found their musical instruments to overcoming the surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students is become the central interest for the Municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The church, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for their drugs and violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, this changed this after a random meeting with a French pilot, a musical project started and the youth made a rare figure of hopes for youth.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations to the music group, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they go back home after lunch and immediately after lunch race they go through the dust streets to keep their large passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come and play with glossy eyes and play in the Trubel the day of trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, Oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from the world</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero playing the children of Cateura - a village which is virtually at the largest landfill of AsunciÃ³n in the capital city - at instruments which are made of remodulated waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprepared instruments which consist of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop dedicated to music instruments in Cateura, where the recycling began using Favio ChÃ¡vez, to turn parts of the assignment in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imize, viola, celli, contrabasses, guitars, flute, trumpets, trumpet, trumpet, trumpet and drums, all of which were produced from the waste.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguan and Latin American music as well as music by Beatles, from Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local oil ologist and a teacher of the children of Cateura:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no space for samples and we had to do at the same place where the parents had no music, and it was very difficult to contact their parents, because many of them are living with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">That changed when the Favio has slightly shown that he had never seen: one of the most produced violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a full orchestra that plays every kind of instruments and this is the Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic landfill) distinguishes the musical output to:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tonnes of the world every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the sleeves - as people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something SchÃ¶nes.</seg>

<seg id="96">This eastern African countries show how technology and teamwork have been successfully able to fight the illegal fishing countries</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that struggles with wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This entry, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published in Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release occurs in the context of an agreement with Global Voices on common use of contents.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated in liberized waters of illegal fishing, before it sought the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">According to the Eastern African countries, the East African countries were over and little inclined to welcome the law of this kind to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the comors, Mosambique, and the Seychelles include a rapid against the ship. you don't miss it to divide one of her harvestments, and to divide it to him.</seg>
<seg id="103">Suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries who is simply changing everything, "recalls the Kiilu, a senior executive of the kenian fisheries. he is part of a team that discovered the ship of a time.</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was expelled out of the waters of the region: it was not succeeded to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was obliged to pay $2 million to Liberia, because of plotation of the country's stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The nucleus of this initiative, criminal cases and resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Hotel (Illegal al fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are besides Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries, who had their waters in their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">We have eight countries, which are listed and are working together. they know about illegal fishing. "he says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable project Ending Illegal 1. this project offers FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is linked to definition: what is caught, is hidden because of it extremely difficult. this, illegal fishing is a major cause of fisheries from regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By the deliberate abuse of existing laws, which shall be protected by certain living rooms and types, the illegal fishing ecosystem damage, which have a delible balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while campaigns against illegal fishing will be disabled by bureaucratic hurdle through bureaucratic hurdle and the information between individual countries, such as the actions in realtime, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There may be the individual countries with each other, for example lists of existing licenses, news, and details that could be noticed during a port at the port of a port.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i has pursued the activities of ships also very attention when they move on an open lake, with satellite endship.</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible to characterize the authorities to do ships, which are coming into banned areas. also, for example, to indicate that a ship invites his dead fish on other ships on other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the ideals, such studies show whether the participating ships have a fish pond license, where they were travelling and possibly, whether they have a strawgister.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are on the basis of these ships, are based on the basis of these ships in their ports. what means that the ships can not sell their charge in their ports. and that they could be forced to do the numbers of penalties, as in the case of Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">Then, a significant financial losses for the owner, meaning that the illegal fish is to be financially worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company that supports illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already called platform was created to gain more than 20 million dollars to lost sales, which will lose eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of illegal fishermen who are penetrate in East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive Thunfish oil paintings, so due to the region of commercial fish shops in the whole world. however, the illegal fisherman.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among other things, the actions include the sail of fallow flag, revolutionized licensing, specification of imagined species, the fish protected species and fish in nature.</seg>
<seg id="123">They take advantage of the missing international cooperation, and make the weaknesses of a non-organized control system, "says long." earlier, a ship was illegal and a country could not go to the port of my port. "</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Komm to me'. "and exactly this legale gorges are to close to FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far, the closed front.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspected ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has been exposed to criminal networks to spread the number of licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships in which the number of fraudulent identities and it has been persecuted and found ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority in control of crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over long distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us rather far to the networks organised crime", "says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">He is building a system that will help the FISH-i to help you more precise ships.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is always developed further, helps illegal ships to hide the illegal ships.</seg>
<seg id="133">Illegal Fischer use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position. "he says Duncan Copeland, head of Trygg Mat Tracking, an NRO, which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships switch to the example their automatic identification systems, which they can't be used anymore by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that combines various information on each other. it should help you find FISH-i help in criminal ships with larger precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">Yet, FISH-i's team African nations actually influence the no global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes the NRO SkyTruth.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth together with Google and the Marine protection organization Oceana opens the platform Global Business Watch: a platform that offers satellite endship and can be displayed by means of each individual traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">With the neighbors who want to get a better picture of what what does it - this is simply sense, "he says." here is a chance for countries to combine and to join her resources for the study.</seg>
<seg id="141">We should do this on a global level. "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project, where a global system allows persecution of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">There is no evidence that FISH-i's activities do not only have a criminal sense, but they also cast them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships who had previously been confiscated without license and hardly had to be reckoned with consequences, know that they will be observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the interest in FISH-i participating countries, a 33% increase in fisheries, has been selling more licenses ever since.</seg>
<seg id="145">Once FISH-i Somalia helped in Greko 1, the Inspectors found there on board towing network, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries will notice this success. "the effect is strong that us now has to copy other countries," says Kiilu. "we will disappear here one hundred million dollars by illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are six countries participating in the 2015 West Africa Task Force. also, it can tackle illegal fishing, after exactly the same model as FISH-i.. "security is the goal to be even more such initiatives and structures also in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's younger member in Somalia made its first major triumph: in October, Greko 1, a ship which was on the road. not only the ship has been on the road and not only used a license and towing towing that are prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also covered in dry waters that are reserved for fisherman from Somalia. "" "with a score against Greko 1," a strong sign that they go for illegal fish-catcher "," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i is a further success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a particular, collaborative work is actually work throughout the world. Emma Bryce is freelance journalist and lives in London. she writes on the environment, technology and nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="152">Their article appear in the Wired Magazine, Ted Education, the New York Times and the Guardian. location in Venezuela came up further: demonstrations in several cities with the aim to conquer "the country."</seg>
<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a shaft of violent demonstrations.</seg>

<seg id="204">He held the family secret secret for 34 years.</seg>

<seg id="206">I felt like a secret magic.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years you notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I didn't know that my father was a dieb, torture and mortar.</seg>

<seg id="223">Therefore he forbade to go to the sports hall. some days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He said to me, I would be secret.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought would be in order. for example, my Father had moved me.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base, I had to destroy, and had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university ports, handwritten notes, Literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simple everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me a total of four times after La Perla with - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time he left me at the entrance of the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he was able to change to me. he led me to a barbacke, in the cars, furniture, TV, refrigerators - just everything far.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little in a ceiling when turned to me, it was to wear a car. when I opened it, I saw that it was a large clumps silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On this day, I went to the other end of the Baracke, where the stolen were taken and conducted me with a wposten.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he has made a open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners is tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I splash in and saw a couch that were tortured on the people.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found that they attached to an end to a cable. the other end was fixed at the body of the person, which was just removed there.</seg>

<seg id="243">The rocks there was there to be a bit... like a dirty Windel as a dirty Windel.</seg>
<seg id="244">In later, when my father stood under house arrest, the same smell came from his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and I was clear that the smell of a body in Not is.</seg>
<seg id="246">I never forget this smell never forget.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked me: how is it possible to do that man can do any other so much cord?</seg>
<seg id="248">'I knew what these people were killed'</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father worked for the third time in the third time, he led me to the entrance of La cuadra - the area where the captives merged with handcuffs and were examined.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke with "Chubi" Lopez (Jose LÃ³pez, a civilians who was also charged in trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background, I saw a series of mattresses, on which bare people with the face down to bottom - all were filled with hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">In the vicinity of the entrance to the mattresses, people caught up to the mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="253">When my Father noted that I saw to the prisoners, he said, "What gume du so, Arschloch?"</seg>
<seg id="254">I'm afraid, "Why you have brought me otherwise?"</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew what people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were killed and buried in a pit, and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that, because my father told us at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to La cuadra there were some rooms which were named as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito," Romero "went into a man and killed, and killed.</seg>
<seg id="260">According to the survivors of the civilian population is Jorge Romero, who was also indicted in the La Perla Ribera trial, the students RaÃºl Mateo Molina.</seg>

<seg id="263">If you see on the card, you see that they were about this way, and then tortured to the first time.</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their name changed and they were assigned as part of the trial of the human being a number.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra, until the arrangement of above came, they should be moved to them.</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the Euphemism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'War Crimes'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all possible things to begin with home.</seg>
<seg id="269">Back then, at that time I had no idea about what the "war against" - as it was called.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was later to the military, I was in the Gendarmerie - it was clear that war against a Bajonett or perhaps military sign that man fights to fight.</seg>

<seg id="274">It is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I always asked myself, how my father, the head of security forces, could participate in the Vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer in the Gendarmerie and I would never have noticed, into a house into a house and everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my Father could do it.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once called he called me a criminals, and I answered, and thou shalt go to the road cars on the street?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are no detective?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded me against Wut, struck me and cried:</seg>

<seg id="284">My father was my father.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have not only a good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">When I said in the process, I revealed a photo from then, on which I had a jacket and a escalator. both of them had my father from La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he brought clothing at home.</seg>
<seg id="288">Back then, the defense of defence was allowed to have a co-literal during this crime. I did not resist any problem that they wanted to go to the load of what they wanted to do.</seg>
<seg id="289">I was sooner why I was to appeal.</seg>

<seg id="297">One day, my father brought a girl who had been killed by his mother, his mother had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">It was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">I always had the question: they were tortured, but why they were killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">They could simply bring it to prison, but you can simply bring it to prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess, it was simply decided to kill these people. but, to make their dead bodies?</seg>
<seg id="302">These people do not have families to have been handed over to their sterity?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance, the bodies of the bodies is the last abscanned act, which can do one person.</seg>
<seg id="304">My father told me when the democracy was re-launched, holed them, to eliminate the remains of the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="305">They were broken and somewhere somewhere - no idea, where. "you will never find something," said my father.</seg>

<seg id="309">I even had even at Gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just make the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought to show my father, was born during a meeting when he stood under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him to work with him because of all the things that I had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="313">Then he suddenly appeared: "I don't know. I have killed niemanden."</seg>

<seg id="352">The following in Kyoto's daily KYOmbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it could come to an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This demonstrates that no one has read the translation.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is a reward of elderly people and in an international city such as KYOU's simply unacceptable, "said Holmes.</seg>
<seg id="356">The incorrect English translation was first removed. the name "other drivers" (German: "furry driver") was replaced later by the appropriate "fields" (German: "older driver") was replaced by the appropriate driver "(German:" older driver ").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police in the Kyoto Protocol has occurred for the translation errors. furthermore, it declared that the error was already in the text, they had not been checked by the translator, and that the translation was not published on their judges before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A Blogger reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" it's correctly that older people suffer by the inadequate correction (the translation) our part, "said the police.</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News won a slightly detailed phenomenon of the "furry" elder "in Japan apart and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "venebar" was resumed as a reasonable description of the following driver. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are involved, but the reason is to worry about.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, 1.941 of a total of 19.460 accidents were caused by the same period in 2005. this corresponds to a 10% share.</seg>

<seg id="375">Photo of Flickr users Andrew.</seg>
<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation were varied.</seg>
<seg id="377">For example, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the output text and active language skills to transfer him into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active Behy of the target language - something that is the case in the speakers in the case. generally, the conviction is the conviction that a translator was in the target language - not in the initial language - speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speakers for example from the English to French French - not by French in English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese company employ a number of Japanese companies in English as a native language, which may cause translations to English into English. this is a lack of understanding for the overpass, cost-rÃ¼nde or the relatively small number of English speakers, Japanese learning.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies who have no foreign staff, let me do not change their mentions. then the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is the best one to be a translator. no matter how well or bad his language are really good.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The fact that these technology can be revealed by mechanical translations, show that these technology has no longer replace a human translators. this applies to some languages quite well.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English formulation in Japan, including the tseling prints, often used T-shirts or bags, are used only from style reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr-users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors like jewels are still acceptable or at least a harmless. but by major companies or from the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards, you can expect more effectively.</seg>
<seg id="389">The City of KYOTO utilizes a replication source for its translations in future.</seg>

<seg id="465">Ever it was finished with learning, the more leisure time had it.</seg>
<seg id="466">However, this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says that she had never had to be starved, but did not have not limited food. "I was allowed to pick up books from the library of the housewife as food from the refrigerator."</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the housewife, an old military and sympathy of the Partido Liberal, a Liberal party, which was held during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was part of the opposition from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">In addition to him, "Sendero," or "El Pueblo" could be read on some evenings of the households' Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="470">In fact, he tried to convince them to convince the reports of the official media about the regime of the dictator.</seg>
<seg id="471">He held them for intelligent, but didn't want to meet someone with her. "the housekeeper had found someone who heard it, while he spoke," says she says. "</seg>
<seg id="472">They were not often to visit my family, because she was the opinion that I would go there again. "I said that Alvarenga, who belongs to the indices of the GuaranÃ­ group, was to speak at home again in GuaranÃ­.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their lord, feared that they had their formation, which they had to lose it, explains it again.</seg>
<seg id="474">It was however completely clear that they had paid for everything that they had paid for them, with their hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in school was Alvarenga discreet. "an article about which is never been spoken, Mobbing and the slotes are exposed if they are exposed to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have their parents have immediately, recognize that someone who has no parents who has no parents, a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I was able to invite home to me home. I had no freundeskreis in school or neighborhood next to me.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, at the time where friends will arise, I feel very clearly that I belonged to no group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The isolation was the worst from all, "explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="480">The society is cheap to the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="481">In January 2015, a woman published the following text in a Facebook group, where we can share their experiences for cleaning agents and children's maids in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="482">The administration of the group is Pepa Kostianovsky, a city council in the AsunciÃ³n district.</seg>

<seg id="490">In the third comment was written by "a girl from the country to work in the third comment."</seg>
<seg id="491">Then the author of the advertisement still is once again:</seg>

<seg id="496">(criaditas, as long as long?), a collection of stuff from former Criaditas, writes Ornote:</seg>
<seg id="497">In the course of our history, we made it into account that the Spanish congresses took place in the Spanish era, where he was not willing to prove that many girls and boys were willing to establish that many girls and boys are going to be found in a system of slavery, where they are light victim for abuse of abuse and exploitation.</seg>

<seg id="499">The bill was writing by Egyptian users of social media in order to register the government in the government.</seg>

<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections recently ordered a legislative face to "regulatory approvals regarding the use of the use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">When he is accepted by Parliament, user players need to register social media in Egypt with a government authorities to register social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law, then a place is set up, which is responsible for citizens, citizens and citizens can use a permission to share social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months of assumption of the law, users would have to use user players on the site with their correct name and personnel numbers to register social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If this is to do this, the remainder of up to six months was sentenced to six months in prison or a money release.</seg>
<seg id="507">The draft bill that consists of six paragraphs and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defined social media as "jedwede application that runs via the Internet and used to communicate with other by voice, video and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is thought there is no indication of the law, such as those who must pay attention, that the Egyptian government does not have to register that the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentary group and promotion of the Legislative Decree, the magazine Al-Monitor, registered user players and users received a password in order to come up by a firewall and a password. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to endure a firewall on national level around Facebook. because of which would be necessary for Egyptians for Egyptians and Egyptians may be necessary to access the network to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is so far not known that these plans consist of these plans.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts and experts prior to site are skeptically regarding the technical feasibility of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technological Research (") of the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights (EIPR," German "Egyptian Initiative for personal rights"), "says Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I biked strongly on the technical capacities and the understanding for any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion it was so important that, just as they could be understood by a physical public and private rooms, they could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I understand it, then this means that they are a powerful surveillance system to apply citizens, which are a permission, or not., and this means a wacky system to monitor the activity of the people, and also to perform a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is a great way of realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be passed as a law, the draft must be discussed under the legislative Parliament and the Constitutional Treaty, before it goes into the plenary of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="519">If its assumption is successful, or not, the design "is in line with a pro-military thinking in parliament in which the control is maximized and be guaranteed to be present that no different scepration of narration on the image area is present," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">In the past year, Tamer El-Shahawy ordered an amendment to Cyber-Crime, who was found guilty of life imprisonment for those who was found guilty, that "public order will be found guilty, and to protest the" public order. "</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the Kahoku Shimpo's progress began to rebuild the life in the past six years. an enormous earthquake, tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has its headquarters in Sendai the Preyagi Prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture was a fine prefectures in Japan northeast, both to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had disappear from the city map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Still in the prefecture Fukushima a atomic accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The Special Annual Report of the Kahoku Shimpo will be achieved from local view over six years to rebuild the life of local-based local.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authorities as well as poll results of the person affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing facility in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses are being held in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwations by December 2015.</seg>
<seg id="552">In the largest success, Miyagi was a period of 80 percent of the planned spare parts were finished, here, 80 percent of the planned spare parts were finished.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has finished 75 percent of such houses, while the Fukushima still forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated from Behelter (hives, Cauetsu juutaku) in the final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple-catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in Behavior.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such areas.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 per cent of the evacuees from Fukushima still living in emergency, whereas more than 75 percent of the evacuation was evacuated and moved to the Desaster in Behelter and moved into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The work of the work and everyday life in the three affected fectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 children of 1100 schools were affected by the bad, its gates will be opened up until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of schools in three fectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three fectures was much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of the fisheries in Iwate and Miyagi are now back in operation, in Fukushima only 30 percent of the fisheries were resumed their operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident, have moved into the three prefectures of agricultural land in the area.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of his agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50% destroyed arland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that only a result of nuclear warmed is, because 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land-destroyed arland of Fukushima are found in the "nuclear-nuclear zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three fectures, tourism has remarked the tourism reaching back again, but also here Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again to 90 percent at the same stand, as before the bad. Fukushima, however, can only have 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo Zeitung reports that since the catastrophe is almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it's more difficult to earn her life.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population to the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a overall picture, the newspaper resulted in numerous issues among the local people and among the evacuation. she asked them about the status of rebuilding and also, as you can find themselves at the tsunami's risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In the introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">Kahoku Shimpo led a survey through to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey showed that 83.1 percent of the site-based inhabitants, measures to be inflated to future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 per cent of respondents said that it was not enough enough for catastrophes prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is around those who had to evacuated from the Fukushima evevacevacevacevacevacevacevacevacevacevacuation.</seg>
<seg id="576">In her issue for the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung gave its attention to the location of evacuation from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima did not only experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Prekushima did get witness to the worst, catastrophiance, atomizing, who had to experience Japan each.</seg>
<seg id="578">Nearly 63 000 people were evacuated from Fukushima. almost 63 000 people were transferred in the areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were something more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima. they have been converted to Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the stand of 2017, more than 40 000 inhabitants live from Fukushima off their home Prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">Most of the evacuities, most of the evacuities, is still over 50 years old. they have to compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima. here, it is a construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games, which will be held in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Law of Ãlvaro Reynoso was formed by almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, who is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - known that there is no nennines of sugar cane on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years later than the activities in the sugar cane factories were laid down.</seg>
<seg id="629">After creating the sugar pipe industry in the region, and the factory lost to and from its plants, until only the rumors had remained in steel and concrete.</seg>
<seg id="630">In total, about 272 workers had to be re-found.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some interactions the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and penile daily among the factories that's even mastered.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a solo veteran, who stands every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar tube industry is not smoking his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that it was in the east of the sugar pipe factories, which are back in operation again after long time, because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something unexpected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene is reminiscent of having heard that in MaÃ±alich the sugar tube factory would not be kept, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar pipe industry is already in plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prizes, the Ineffness, the bad administrative decision and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production of 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced a lot.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been some decades ago a motif for the country, but the bad proportions are no longer than newness.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why, the Cuban sugar tube industry has been selected?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway station saw already better times at the age of better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The size of the sugar pipe industry was a economic necessity: the 155 sugar pipe factories were technically obsolete, and barely competitive, they were unportable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus on the most efficient factories that annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories that could produce sugar for the most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs, which led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar tube plantations and the access crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar prize rose to about one decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pounds, according to the 2016 "Landwirtschaftskammer" by OECD and FAO, the Agricultural and Health Organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production volume of 2001 would reach (3.6 million tons), the raw storage capacity would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Didn't everything ran good</seg>
<seg id="652">Today, "today's day, with safety in history," these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro, during his speech on October 21, 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From the process of restructuring in the sugar industry, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the deformation of a total of 98 sugar pipe factories, more than 65 million people received its full advantage for advanced training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same thing happened in the sugar tube factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez, worked in the factory since 1967, has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, is the word that he is most repeated, "Better."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all those questioned are the same opinion: not one of them became informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">For this, they will receive a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first quarter of the year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was about official documents about documents that are removed only regarding the parts that would be removed, the address sat and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were in Ulsan Rosales del Toro, just the ministers could have been approved by the Minister.</seg>
<seg id="663">From this, the responsibility was over and the letters were increasingly often more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for two years for the stills of factory and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money" sugar beet, no money, "insured.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waiting for the pensioning of another plant, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was against his will in the decomposition of the factory, in whose construction he helped to help.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part, which he remote, dismantled one of his 31 work years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial range of Cuba and most important work in the world was removed.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there are no alternatives to the work and performance that have generated, in which they were generated in the municipalities where they were found.</seg>
<seg id="670">We never know, whether during the Mammut address given from 21 October 2002, the former president in the eyes of the present person saw, when he was guaranteed for the areas, whose factories have been in operation for five years.</seg>

<seg id="695">The workshop rises to that the young participation in discussions, such as "cultural identity," language, confrontation, love, self-acceptable, "or what they always comes in the sense.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, in which the young people are the main actor.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations-communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the region of the kito, tells the history of the Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a road section in Westkanada, on which nearly two dozen young women disappeared or killed or killed.</seg>

<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel sometimes, I would not be ever interested in me.</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on earth my days on earth.</seg>
<seg id="707">That's the day you'll be able to take our Schrei.</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we lost our way to life in the life.</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe it in mind that we will participate in our day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they are a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and do them at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports and foreign media about the infamous "fight against the drug trading in Mexico dive the missing and gear regularly only in statistics. however, this is not the extent of the human tragedy that brings this struggle with this struggle.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting on Drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the chief of the Sinaloa Kartells, the stories of the victims of conflicts completely right in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looking to the trauma or to the communes who have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each Leiche, behind each bone mass in the hundred thousand graves in the hundreds of graves, the stories of children, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose guards are never healing.</seg>
<seg id="753">Therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico was called "Apra a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with drug trading live") to give a voice to the life and stories of people who told them in the fight between the criminal authorities and stellen.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime against us not only to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deep-reaching.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops have close, because they are threatened by drugs, and whole communities are to run for many kilometers, to buy something like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vidas que cam por el miedo" (German: "such as fear) tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">One main character is Guadalupe, a father, who is looking for every weekend, to his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez, who lost her father to her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of its nephew.</seg>
<seg id="762">Priest: "like every Sunday, we prepare for us again to the task which we put us, and go to graves, after humans that we loved you."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28, when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in a electric shop in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On October 13 he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">On October 15th he should return back again, but he came again. "Emma Veleta:" it's very difficult for me because I am now with three children who need a training.</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother who is also here with me.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment they have no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">Your stands out the insurance of my father, but the gets it out, because the death certificate.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where we should I get the because "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editorial of "Apra vivir con el narco," explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not only show the faces of those who show the fear of fear. we have to show the conflicts in the international community, the Liberation and state guide.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a read of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this contribution from taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution is reminds us that you should never take violence as normal, no matter, in which form they will occur:</seg>
<seg id="779">I know, for some years, illness and Sensation journalism I know now for some years.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come up every day from newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with images that are actually only composed of a teacher for Criminology or from Akten specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me from the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes, I feel the feeling that I am the only one or sad, it is sad, as a lack of respect to respect for the person who once belonged to this body once a lack of respect.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be valid or can be regarded as normal or normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">You have to writes:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin think that he is big. and it is not normal that people can hear about the "Heldentates" of the Straight, if they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, that is, when they would have those who have lost, and those who fear to fear that them happens to be something.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories will be naked numbers in an statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The facts of the man is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance can be justified by 43 students in a neighbour place therefore they were justified. "</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to talk about that they are spared from such a load, if they did not stir and quiet.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "four months Erpressung in the main city," as a family with threats, it describes as armed criminal month for the month of their business, until they were not only destroyed by the end, but also their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think about everything you have lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain mentioned above is never before the grape of trauma, the fear comes back again, if you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">We have changed, phone numbers also have changed.</seg>
<seg id="794">We contact us only if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">Depending on the track we can be removed from each other.</seg>
<seg id="796">She completed their report with words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want to be arrested that the other is arrested, for you don't know when they lead you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked me in this slowest days, but it would be sure to solve my deepened feelings, but the name is no, because I don't forget how to get wine. I must learn how to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a Generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he set up questions on how: who does care about the child of a mixed wife and a man who was murdered by the organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it, in a settlement on the edge of the endangering city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, their parents take care of care.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphanage and he tells himself, how to make a egg, potatoes, tortillas and "Chichi" for the Babies, who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of food with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine Narben on his left side - one for each year.</seg>
<seg id="805">However, they are unknown in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unausing for a young man for the whole life of violence, and to learn how to live.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had vanished.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day after the childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood has been over two years before, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody Leiche saw his father, who had been killed by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born as Bryan, the situation in JuÃ¡rez is made out of:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was carried out by the organized crime and the fight against humanity, with the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most endangered town in the world due to the number of civil servants for public safety and government of the government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010, the Public Prosecutor's Office was 3103 Morde. this corresponds to the average 8.5 rate per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only some of hundreds of thousands of stories that organised the organized crime in Mexico leaves and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories live in view of the new headlines. this project reminds us of those who don't forget to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Apra a Vivir Con" in 2015, "Animal PolÃ­tico was called" Animal PolÃ­tico 2015, whose goal is to present the complex information on the failed struggle against the drug, which the country has brought into the past four decades, in a few kind of way.</seg>

<seg id="817">Sharing is Caring "from the Flickr users Niklas WikstrÃ¶m WikstrÃ¶m (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNUNG. this post and the pages which he linked linked, do not include pictures, on which violence.</seg>
<seg id="818">The factor check is important in an moment in which it goes out to lift a buzz or a counterfeit.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years after something the first time ever up is? content in social media, whether a true or untrue, even further to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">We take this photo of a terrible accident in front of seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been used to have irreversible effects in order to have tragedies, which actually have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false description of image and event - "false description" or "wrong context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - is not the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage regarding events in the DR of Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">It's possible to ask questions about our desire to pictures.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker moved to the town of Sange in the east of the DR of Congo, kippte and exploded over 230 people.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country has been neglected and devastated, which were devastated. the streets in the region were turned into dangerous scades full of drummer who had become difficult to travel.</seg>
<seg id="827">The tank trucks fell victim to the tanker.</seg>
<seg id="828">A fireball is described as a fireball, the dutzing houses, including a cinemas in the vicinity, the full of people who had experienced the football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses and wired corders in the streets are scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the Unity.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "This is Nigeria." from Imgur-users Mystical Monkey, 12th January 2015.multiple photos of the incident form the gray content of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example for this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows the ranks of the series, which are mounted on the floor, while people are looking for people.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here you don't find the story here.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photograph has been upgraded several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but not so much in the context of tragedy, especially the events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, Boko Haram participated in Bokhoistani village of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyepiece reported drastically of atrocities, before whom they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops have been burned in roads and praying in the streets and prayers.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were instrumental in.</seg>
<seg id="841">However, the numbers could not be confirmed. "nobody stayed back to count Leichen," said a population of Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were zery, shot or burnt.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite imagery, the following periods could be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack remained unresolved, but the army leadership in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military-Nigeria and the attempt by Boko Haram, country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture dating back to the DR of the Congo, as it was proof of evidence for the fact, and the possible quantity of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre in 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">You are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, these abuses of the image from the DR of Congo is only one in a number of errors; Africa check has been documented in order to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the image was brought down as a reward of the measures.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further refine your comments, such as this example, the image from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in connection to be arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also joined together with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash, published by the United Nations, those who could flee rage, rape, and many dead, some of which are of burning.</seg>

<seg id="948">A word or any term is not enough to understand what a full explanation and sometimes a regular context are necessary to understand what is meant with this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists of Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, during the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>

<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Turn your parents in recognition of how to have been involved in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunshies language, which are spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">Kwadi "- The comfort or Faults that you feels like to get there in cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his Blog:</seg>
<seg id="956">You have other crops, unlock other cultures, unlock other cultures and awaken our new gierde.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, as we have influence the world around the world around and classify the linguist on this page and show more of these "unmatched" words, and show how different, valuable and impressive are of these small languages.</seg>

<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers, and authors who worked on the movements of Free knowledge, have worked on site to provide about the nebula, which gives our newsletters and create a slightly sense from our different experience.</seg>

<seg id="1193">His name was formed from the directory of the Adra Majestic Product, which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>

<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective diplomats gives his friends and his family a voice, who want to fit his release and put him back in its normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">See how Bassel has a high price for his participation in a free culture, has many of us begin to think about their own fate, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we are here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">We opted for us?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What we did in this process of expression of extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for Open Source and digital activist has been in custody of Syrian government since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and Annotin Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel was on the basis of a" strictly printed "recorded by the Military Court of his cell in Adra."</seg>

<seg id="1204">However, his stay place and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A leader in Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a decisive role that access to the internet and to the knowledge of the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technical ologist and currently oversees the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps there was none of bass prototypes as the factory, which he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005, to construct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the passing of numerous civilian populations and immigrate the Greek-Roman architectural styles of local traditions and persican.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel was not able to know that ten years after having started working with this work, this architecture, which is not only the cultural heritage of the world, but the world embodied.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This carton into the digital archaeology and the preservation has created a time, which will be presented to the public as well as scientists and artists in the future of invaluable value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">In this project, Bassel has been able to finish this project so far.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband, his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life so that freedom to dream and Bassel taught me, they are poor.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I have been overwhelmed by the name, I am overwhelmed.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me to me in English, even when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read English well, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always dealt with any knowledge that he has asked, "he has taught many Indies, English, write and speak to speak.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened the gate for technology. he taught me, both computers as well as Smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He has also brought other intra, as they use computer, at least theoretically, without it actually kept one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a prosabbook that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was arrested in detention.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together with the book for one year.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mosambik: due to corruption and sentenced to recent years due to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambique's resigned with wrath on a corrupt case, in which a member after half of his prison sentence returned to the workplace in which corruption was committed to the corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1256">It concerns Diodino Cambaza, who in 2008 was arrested and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment with four other defendants because of the untreance of 54 million Meal (approximately 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money descended from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, whose Council Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good guided tour, and called on his resetting to the company what happened on April 19, then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion from the General Attorney's Office of the Republic that would have no obstacles for Cambaza, again, because the company has not moved his old proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, hot inhabitants are not good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for public integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution, which was condemned to public transparency, sentenced in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision to set the company's decision to set the director.</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a return in the fight against the corruption measures and clear, the feeding of transparency and is even a backward step in terms of the efforts of our legal system, the CIP system.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note of the company that the company would have had a disciplinary proceedings against the supply negotiating.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However the company does not occur and causes no reasonable legal steps for the application of the respective functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the mosaic social media, plays this behavior and considered as "resisted":</seg>
<seg id="1266">When Cambaza is a competent type, he would have been an adviser after having been sentenced to prison, and half of which were reduced by half.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could advise lectures and motivating speak, he could consult and his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has been approved in the company reintegrated into the company, which he helped to add damage to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza is paid for his tail.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Get rid of the resistance!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, a young Mosambians and student of the political science in Brazil, says the Director of any Moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza of the state was rewarded, because he cannot believe him that I want to meet someone at such a way that the state has already been massively massif.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the Moral back and to serve the state, * which had already serve a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead, only on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state, as a handy money source, and the state itself has become a tired, and the state itself was tired and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte, preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, remember that a dieb belongs to the prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Diebe belong to the prison of Samora Machel, not only to remain as the first independent President in memory, but also as a scarlet, cutting and - next to - prophetic Redner.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of its most famous oral renderings, as he confirmed that "an ambitious human beings is to be able to sell the patland for his ambitions, its own individual interested parties."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora said: "I don't know, if an ambitious human being changes, my experience shows that the tactic, but he is not of his ambitions.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to the information of Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network started their podium from the net because they had the word 'kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although above the origin of the Word still has been discussed, it will usually be used to refer to people of indigenous origin or generally as Address. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook is the word "kalar" or "anointed" (in burners ") as part of an initiative to go the widespread problem of the Hasselt language in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In the past few years, the ascent of radical national movements has given an extremely abnormal conforms to the word.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra nationalists than Hassol, which is a minority against Muslims who constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">However in an effort, Hasselt, in Myanmar, the company has a lot of sensible content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar'mag today usually be associated with racism in conjunction with racism, but the word is not automatically revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people reported that Posts have said to be, in which they have used the use of the word, or doubts for the use of his service.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basic markers that have the same letter sequence like 'kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmesan even 'kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words as' kalar Pae '(Spree),' kalar OAT '(Kamel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The facebooky Kaung Myat explained the various translations of words with the sound of 'kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today, because he contained the word.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends on a spiritual nature, whether they could wush his back pain, by creating a word.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The set ku la - "healing" (ku ") + the questionnaire (la) to Burmesan - resembles the racial expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">In Win, Zin Win is the opinion that it did not reduce the presence of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook analytic must spread all Posts, to spread in the suspicion of Racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook is not manual the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The Automatim is not understand what you encounter with Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it instead, should make the post carefully analyse and control it by clicking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar Pae" (spawbsen).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The Good is that this three-star nationalists, the Hasselt language, has a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is on the time to prevent their Nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action is a powerful signal to all you like to spread the Hasselt, like the efficiency of this strategy is not long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proved that the censorship of drummer will often start to start any kind of social networks, creating a new word or an alternative way to use their views to their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described as Facebook started to extinguish his Posts, as he just wanted to communicate his friends, that the word 'calar' of the social network is exiled:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of the new Directive of Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends, that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">After it, my post was removed from Facebook and me, the liken, post, position and parts of contents for 24 hours, because the post "post" Facebook community has not been established. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of Posts of people who have no negative descent, or the simply try to show their opinions against the hate nationalist nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post office has been removed, nothing has to do with Hasselt:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Postal address is located by Facebook without a sign from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author started his opinion about extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should do more in front of the initiative to do more, for example, the Burmese Internet community have questions:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook like a well-looking intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words, only more hatred will bring to more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it appears as if they started without any local context or technical support, and so words as "chair" or "rsencurry" banned.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even if they found out that they did not have any mistakes, they were not tried to maintain the deserved Posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they only accounted for a little more respect for the 15 million benefit, who would have a great turnover, would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facved auto-censorship for much Spott among the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of it, users are now fun and write the word 'kalar' not in the context of Hasselt, to see whether their podium will be taken from the grid.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook-Posts, who don't have a Hasselt language but nevertheless removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">In use with approval.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and a pea curry and a Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Only to try to try Facebook, the word is called the word. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, with approval.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"If you are said," If you are a doctor, heal me? "</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, with approval.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious discovery are used to have social networks to improve their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, Hasselt, in addition to social networks in addition to violence in the Churches in Myanmar, especially in the area Rakhine, where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have been forced thousands to escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was said to be to be criticized by his burmese pages under control, criticized to his burmese pages under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than simply the word 'kalar', it would have been better to know more in the context as shown on the code-concentrated initiatives and of them.</seg>

<seg id="1345">Prior to this change, there was a number of members of religious and musculation communities. at that time, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the religious religious groups of the country, said that the state could not be certain that the state must be certain maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened in the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is an authorized partner for the UN children's rights, which is the minority, every man under 18 years. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were married with 15 percent in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent, and with 18 were 8,1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">The State Central Office of the country confirmed that from 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements who earns to create the laws of the children before, followed by the foot and inherited great support. no doubt, they will not perform this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless we didn't want to do everything.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leaders, for example, had no concerns to say the critics of the children before, they should be damned in order to take care of their own business. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition was actually uncomplicated in these actually uncomplicated matter, and sometime, there were doubt, whether the opposition came to the bill at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">However, at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided - despite 4 transmitters (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, which he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the President of the country have to agree to the President and the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's content of the country gave to Facebook an status update that Leslie-Ann Boiselle at Instagram again:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the legislative design against the children's office was in a representative building with 35 votes against it and not only decided on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having decided in the Senate, the draft recommendation can now be appointed to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media user was thrilled because the laws had been changed to the children before.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook-member Lovell Francis, who held a Council of Ministers in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has a lot of time and opaque, which has used the core of the matter, but you know what? the children before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While exercising, the opinion was definitely enough, it was definitely enough to create the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was so happy that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status update on Facebook von Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:, Hervoran news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The couple has been agreed.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, votes - 35 for them - 0 against it!!!!</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, who belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group that said quite openly about how important the adoption of the law, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The home-friendly old age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious powers of 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft for the amendment to Christianity was today, on 9 June 2017, was decided on June 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">In the House of Representatives, there are 41 members of them were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All MPs, which were assigned to the law, have been responsible for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The children before, is not permitted in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long struggle against...) # 2,500</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all of the activists who have fostered him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A Danke to our MPs.</seg>
<seg id="1375">However, a possible hook is found in the form of satellite Maharaj, the Secretary-General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Before months, Maharaj successfully announced his intention to enter the law, and the law should be passed, and he appears to be a promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the general prosecutor, Paris Al Rawi, a provocation of law, said that it was quite lawful, when Maharaj was going to go on, it would cause most social media users, one would go different debate on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed in front of:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear satellite, if we want to talk about the discussion, that we will protect the state in our bedroom, so that it may protect them from great, hard-shotted men who need to be abused for them, "would you be willing to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or believe that there is no problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it is now an important step toward the law, or not, this legislation is an important step, however, there are still places in the world where the children can be legal in various types of gradations and still the standard, although it does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Hackers started the office of the national trial in front of the Russian National Day on the Russian National Day.</seg>
<seg id="1383">Screen printing on the news on Sunday early on the web site of Yaroslavl district was posterior.</seg>

<seg id="1385">Or we bring you to the Knast instead of dion. "</seg>
<seg id="1386">The hackers used the YouTube video "He is no dion for you" on the site of the Prosecutor's website: "the Office of the prosecuting a citizens call on, the provocations and not to keep all non-sankable events!"</seg>
<seg id="1387">By 11.15, the news was removed from the site - in the intermediate memory, however, it remained on the basis.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English language Wikipedia page has been handed over on January 18, 2012, and willy among the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright laws in the USA, is internationally darkened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created from Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">Since over a month, Turkey is the popular and fit on the crowd sourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">The day for Day is increased, as important as the platform for users, to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students as well as reporter and fans of TV series interactions against the Spering.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many engineers were used to use web pages for block web pages (an current article published by the New York Times reported that Turkey is the third biggest VPN prevalence of the world), while most common Wikipedia users are not in this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey's article written by Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, there are regular blocking of the Internet since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was approved.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it goes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform still remain closed, several Mirror sites (pages, which reflect the contents of Wikipedia) and often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution was made from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System) when the platform contains all Turkish Wikipedia pages on whose decentralised peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator computer connections), which does not appear on the system of domain name and thus makes a complete censorship.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is also available in spite of the prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports on his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we heard the news (via the Spering of Wikipedia), we used everything to place the snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility to read the content on decentralised and divided up.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This may help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they can't reach the website www.wikickorg himself.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also was also carried out that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation. it's just a screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to handle the sperre.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy brought both tr.vikiansilage o.org, a open source project that everyone can be used to hooked by similar Mirror, if in the respective country, Wikipedia is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices and employees at Mozilla in Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It's no complete copy of a proxy address, a Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You will take up a different URL that is not the original. that what you can see, is Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server is essentially the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia even if this is locked into Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this purpose is executed by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos, which he looked around around, never satisfied. they disappeared with a bad position and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to wear a camera to wear and try the situation too.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then, he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar strives to bring back to the international stage at the age of 28.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home location directly next to Chitwan National Park, offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos, which led the attention to Nepals wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook, how to help him this first-class location in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could give it better for a passionate wilderness!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I discovered me home when I was in Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan GLM Lodge). he had received a call from my father, that the river of the Rapti river would be a Leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river river is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately, I started my camera with my camera, and was in a few minutes there.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river page, where the Leopard was immediately back and I started immediately, pictures!!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to achieve a collaboration with the authorities to achieve global recognition of Nepals in nature and like to prevent the understanding for this deep, wild animals did not as furmiter, as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, as he was already against face to face to face by face.:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger is not out from the opinion of the sheep's opinion!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">I was also home because of the darkness to the home when suddenly the king of the Buke appeared. he is immediately urning, we see how and he hunts me through the sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">In order to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I clicked for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for the promotion of Nepals and nature, however, is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and lived mostly in a tent in order to play in the Bardia National Park photos from Otters. up to 12 days, until he could photograph a tiger, and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds, who live near the tourist information.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a Content Sharing Convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts, India is to avoid women with the greatest care, the name of their husbands or even from older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a Proneous or say "Father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">Chhattisgarh until Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect to the husband and respects the husband, as well as the fear of consequences, they should be abused to use this practice in life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted in the Indian state of Obita by a shaky and accompanied by their family and the village's community, after having addressed a relatives.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition, their husbands also do not agree with the name, it is also common among men. however, they have much lesser, however, if ever, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health professions and domestic women, a unique club, and were thus fast to the main sthal of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for they alone, in which they discuss the enemy of the patriarchate Patriarchate and discuss.</seg>
<seg id="1478">When one of 56 clubs, which is in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # Khelmets, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and is responsible for the degradation of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paz worked with the help of her video camera for seven years with the help of her video camera, such as children's marriage to the federation of HIV- and AIDS, and runs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It is reported as these clubs created a safe place for those women and they have made up at the same time as ambassador of the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini showed the first video in their debate, "the women who did not call their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject, because she wanted to open the talk about the patriarchate with an issue which is easy to identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">In question, the names of their husbands do not hesitate to address them, and he pleaded not guilty to the question all of the garment pleaded not guilty.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition is testified that a woman respects their husband and wishes a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who cannot enter into one, is regarded as Mrs. without Moral.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted, so we have never made up to this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini wanted to start his husband, so far, so far, had never before, at home, as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-mother.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My father-in-mother and my husband had still long, after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Internash, my husband, turned out to me, and said to me that he will call him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in luggage, Rohini started her first abstract club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that there was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, mostly girls and women.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, women trying to bring discussion with an exercise in gear.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini, in every participant in the name of her husband, with various emotions to say - happy, expired, lovingly and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then, she asked all, "If we do not say the name of our husbands, but they would like to call us how they would like to respects us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should not be more equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">For 30 years, "some of these women have been married since 30 years and this was the first day to talk about the name of their husbands," says Rohini's village in Maharashtra about the latitude of a century history, married women the names of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she had only ed down during the exercise, and another, decided to move the whole fruit against him, and to the fight against him, by saying it.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression of their faces was antistatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenalinus Causch der, with an ancient fires broke out, decided to call them at home, their husbands would have to call their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held her word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband called a wife called Rohini, and asked them to say ideas into the head: his wife was not able to listen to his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her father-in-her mother she received her stared, she got afraid, and said it was an error.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini told me to do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in violence was less understandably and the situation artete in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women tries to stop other practices to stop other practices, such as the trader of the zinnoberred dot points on Stirn, who shows the Forestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would bear the zinnoberred point when it would also be taken.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only wrote, and I heard it, and I heard it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women do not have completely revoked, but my place they are now in a better position, even to choose him at some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can consolidate their opinions and targets.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip at any discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we take lunch and water a spot on the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to make sure the women make women make what could hear, "says it."</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months she celebrated her own birthdays of cake for the first time in her own birthday with cakes; she danced and criticised about things about which they had never noticed.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini said:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I've been working for many years in this problems and yet I have been working for some things, for example as our identities in our husbands are never so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we have given us about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothes with the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been carried out since their marriage, only Saris.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of the okay, but some wanted to have a sallow-Kurta, a far Hemd over a hose, they have not been hered.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much fight and discussion about the benefits of the own hangout, the Moral associated with the Saris and much more, chmugsailed Rohini her own pair (Oberinhibits) in a discussion round, so that women could bear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, and in which they may bear jeans and Rohini's sure that they can create.</seg>
<seg id="1531">At the question of the question whether you have changed over the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirmed that the things have to come slowly.</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have so far made a small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women probies have a few times, but heard again to say the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, me included, but if they are alone, but only if they are alone and there are no other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two women continue to the name of their husbands; only one or two women carry on at any time Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women during the Discussion Papers - know that the changes that they want to reach in their life - as the feille for more movement of movement or its own clothes-election - at the end of a difficult-to-navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By placing on the other self-confidence, they will be aware that they are in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victims of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I have also been there.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives everyone of us that, however, will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. if a chain reaction has been limited, if every woman is reported in the club and others reports, we talk about we speak and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or land?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore has a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may be dummed, since Singapore is recognised as an independent state as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmuzzle, Singapore is considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remarks has triggered a debate in the blogosphere a debate.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York State, the ministers that many people criticized the sole political party of Singapore, because they were compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports the city that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has put into question whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, but most people go to an error.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to declare that we would be different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are no land.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog of Cavalierio accused of the Minister of Justice, "the logic," in order to defend the existing authoritators of the power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all of our efforts and efforts, this precious country, that we could say that we finally gave no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It is so volcanic, it had been forced to escape a flight before the responsibilities.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, wessen the land is then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">They were not very notion: he was not very notion: he defended an idea that could not measure the political system of Singapore not with other "normal countries', in view of his mother, he appeared invisible.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In contrast, he has defended the idea that Singapore had to be compared to the cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, in the same way as the permanent cities of a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratically elected.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once one reaches the subject point of the Thas, the good old dead bodies of the authorized feeders, on the pre-confuse Demokrates, in the case of logic, they perform better to its power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final week, in the final week of Shanmute gave answers to his American guests concerning our press, our jewel, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Relevant questions tarred with non-responses rational species.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng requires Shanmugam upon his opinion, because they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallowed.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but one city is, so that the country belongs to the city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Shortly, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be grateful if our werter K Shanmugam will clarify the effort to clarify these point, unless he was highly paid in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By clicking on the blog, he has published his comment on the reviews, so that you should read the entire scheme of the conference, so that in the context of the testimonies of Shanmugam could be better, according to which Singapore has been a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the co-section.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said, Singapore has said to be a "City," stated as a country, "stated why the elections in Singapore had so important, even if we are able to enjoy free and notable elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He won Singapore with cities in the USA (and as many of these cities saw a party?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said, Singapore "is no country," he did not appear in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment over Shanmugam, which makes the leader of a strong-growing generation, such as a strong statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I'm about that of the Minister of Justice of Singapore, I said,...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least, I knew with Lee kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, which I expected me - unless you agree with them, or not, that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmuzzle, a member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even certain whether he is properly performed, and he is aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek review consists of the weak points of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">That Mr. Shanmugam "is committed to an error" or was a pleasingly pleasurning?</seg>
<seg id="1720">When Singapore is no land, we will be considered as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, in what country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the Intergovernmental Conference, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam of serious significance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why make the Lonavail able to their military service, they only defend her town but not her country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">If our Prime Minister will have to be returned?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink staff?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizen of a country or the residents of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">That the magazine Journey of a Decade to Beyond, Singapore is always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">I haven't said, "what I told" "</seg>
<seg id="1730">This set seems to be more expensive more expensive...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is one country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were there a city-view in the city of State.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often think as "the defense of the country, especially" etc., but this is not quite right.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should talk to the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1739">Global Voices, asked about short of editorial: what is the most frequently used aspect on your home site or home country?</seg>
<seg id="1740">Your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series, the rumble of certain parts of the world will be revealed and another facets will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series is from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, which lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is written in Japan on most is: "are Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, sorry about Leid," I see me. "I am from Canada." since 1994 I live and again in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation, the conversation is taking place, there is a polite, interested in its meeting partner, by creating personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">On my clear overview this is usually the default response: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many canadians cook perhaps inner before Wut, if they are kept for Americans, but did not stop me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who don't know, there is little that differs from the Canadians of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag very visible at their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians are Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1749">On the other hand, Americans are...</seg>
<seg id="1750">It was already, when I started to travel through the world, before Donald Trump, before the march of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried out small Ahornsheets on their baggage by their American neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free healthcare system!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There are no weapons!</seg>
<seg id="1754">However, since 2005, we have been granted legal status in Canada by the same practice ever since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">Everyone seem to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">"" "" we say very often. "</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is supposed to be considered as the tolerability country opposite the ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as this types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hasse this.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends, which I have very admired.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It would be nothing that if you would change me for example with Johnny from Dallas by car.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc in Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">There are also some problems with the stamp "cute."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First, as "nice" referred to as "cute" is basically - as well as the gutters, gentle, but portable, Ned Flanders, "The Simpson's" (which has an own Canadian DoppelgÃ¤nger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really had a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, would be a step forward in fact. but the actual problem is that "kind" does not know. "</seg>
<seg id="1770">There is no corners and edges, nothing, where you encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmlessly, is unconscious, not very interesting and interesting to earn attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">That can be something good if one would like unnoticed in the background, from the things that pass a around.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would like to say to say that if the wish is, freely and alone, one of Canadians is one of the Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We neigen to take care of our own business in order to take care of our own business.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What is the same as "nice" designate, maybe simply can just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians does not speak about the fence with the neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Us missing the warm, open kindness, which I now connect with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">For luck, for us (and for the rest of the world), Justin Trudeau was the stage to show that Canadians are more than just one kind. "our Prime Minister has made clear glass.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the road of Migrants, cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, he is located on the border of Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is directed by a 59--year-old Mexico, a small woman with a corpinkish color frame and gold tones of coloured rings in Teddybular form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. yet they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This pointed name is the fact that the hotel (or rather they have become) a target for Africans and Haitian, who are on the passage.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has rather no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with delicious, flashing walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a dairy.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless, hundreds of African and haitiers come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez, tells the people in full small bus and from the top part of the coast, they begin to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you see Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the time it is rather quiet but in this year RamÃ­rez already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also been slaughtered out in case of cartons.</seg>
<seg id="1912">You would like to set up niemanden.</seg>
<seg id="1913">They also helps them, and brings them to the hospital when they are sick of them, they do not pay a drugs that they do not pay them with a balances from the long voyage check.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived from a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him, whether Mama Africa was a reasonable top name for woman RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1919">Yes, "yes," he is responsible for a smile. "I feel it really it is, since African women are very nice women.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very affectionately.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the heart of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very probably "here."</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister to get to Boston to get to Boston to get her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They already lived in Brazil, however, it is for some Africans that are on the way to the United States, to make a first stop in South America, and then turn to the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard by other members of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route," explains Felix Michelet, a guest of Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitian, and the Africans often travels to Africa, and that Africans went to Africans already on WhatsApp by Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his works, Michelet has lived in Brazil and worked as a construction workers on the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker as the Brazilian economy, he started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest for Mama Africa for months. he sold SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">For this, I am sending him whether he will contact with Mrs. RamÃ­rez on contact with Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and let it never let them back," he will be dimiling. "we will always stay in contact."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs RamÃ­rez tells that their guests can send their often text, if they are still gone, to make them into regards to, or to report about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian belief in the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">You don't know much more than Africa, but their guests have brought her, chickens to prepare as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs RamÃ­rez is perhaps well known, but it is not the only radio hope to travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, a dead end to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valenzuela and his family won in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the bus tickets to be sold to numerous African Migrants to be expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has started to help them, a reasonable price, then he has offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment are 25 people, mainly Haitian.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on ceilings on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela says that he knows what the score make.</seg>
<seg id="1943">I lived in the United States, "he tells me." I've experienced what they experience. "</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border on the wilderness, and we crossed the border.</seg>

<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants, travels across Tapachula, comes from Central America, others, also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez, tells me that he fled in Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to have money back up with him without a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he moved to an accommodation and an unknown, a complete stone, has offered him its roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives and they tried to decide when the next steps should go.</seg>

<seg id="1952">In the gears to consult the traveler quiet of your phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has 20 new guests, a majority of Somalia.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang of Twitter users hives the same...</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in the West of China, are forced to install a demonstration on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of the City of Urumqi sets a mobile phone notification in which it indicates the District government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">In communication, it is said that the app is to be given access to terrorist information. "</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities also use the authorities to use the app for more than control of terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because she had shortly after they had replaced the app, news with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the notification of the police, the app is that the sources and the distribution of the terrorists would be and follow, together with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs Web site describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking of the web site, by online fraud, Troians, and Phishing sides, to make user to make users who want to spend on how much time they are online to remotely control the own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app is intended to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can be used in many different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" state players or even hacker that could be manipulate the home network of a person or to stand.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While melts on digital censorship in China, mostly on the experiences of users in the east and south, is the reality very often nozzles for those who live in distant ethnic minors like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often disseminated extreme conditions and surveillance measures, as well as routinembodied Internet sensations.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media based on Twitter based media Outlet "images from Mainland China" (workers "), released messages in China, showed photos from a Checkpoint where the inhabitants of the residents are unsolved, whether they had the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people are using the official Jingwang-App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification designed to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered at a Checkpoint with a device without this software, they may be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a result for the technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">You've forced the people forced to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity in the rest of the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back again in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">In addition, "images from Mainland China" (hiberths) released a Jingwang-product description, from which the software can increase the password for a Windows operating system, thereby prolonging the access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computer and mobile phones in Xinjiang are available for electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang, possibly a reaction to the instructions of the city party, the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government officials, authorities and research institutions, including universities and research institutes are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office for operation of their computer and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current report from the same House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang the authorities issued the authorities on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, a regulation related to all residents and entrepreneurs as to register its "personal ID cards, phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" in the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously any "terrorist videos" to identify and destroyed. this promotion is not violated the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants, and gives them to include a whole range of other possible prices, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political communications.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The jordan Rapper Emsallam Hdaib speaks about the rights of LGBTQ + Community, free opinion and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib is a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by AMAN Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib brings the majority of his time; it turns out to his computer, and again on his computer, and again on his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can leave however, is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine-hidden lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which since 1967 has belonged to the occupation of the Westbank and Hdaibs family forced to flee their village in Palestine, where they had lived as felahyques (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For the past six years Hdaib is an passionate activist, who puts the majority in the conservative, and their old proven opinions on gender reels, sexuality and free opinion counts through art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which is often translated with themes, such as Orientalism, racism and the situation Palestinian poultry. all of these topics will not only be found in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities that stretches from Damascus in Syria to the whole of Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib looks like a man, who is not too restricted by borders, and he may have suffering a testimony to people who have suffered under the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he is not open, there is no special flags against the US-American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib offers its art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib believes that his co-esteem is believed to survive in the war of war, any detour with his identity as "Palestinian poultry ers" - so he was born himself, even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">I don't think of my own life conditions, "says Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then it adds: "I think, because I am a man," while he dissolved the nest-cafÃ© in two cups, it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise and sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordanic law said that the public consumption of food during the Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has made a certain weakness of weakness; on the other hand, there has a cup of coffee at a sena hot jitag with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Generally, the vacant of warm coffee and the shot of the Kent-cigarette in the nose is in the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes, Jordan, like a prison below open sky, especially when you have a view to the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, by thus avoids it simply to do fundamental things - as in the public during the Ramadan water - to land not to land.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Minister Jordan has had a gig on the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary elections, that support the Islamist branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homossus Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional norms of the country, speaks and the main reason for the concert at the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The member and former press release in the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert is said "just because of the sexual orientation of the receiver.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim that the band's commitment in matters, such as the Arab Spring, human rights and free incorporation into the Arab world, is endangered to dangerous activism, which represents the tried-and-tested Legitimacy regime in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila the jordan people as "progressive supporters for Human Rights," which continue to use "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not simply plugged Rhetoric, but actually, in fact that a clear crystalline reality is clearly seen in the Hdaibs work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib traditional gender norms to Leibe, accompanied by his vision of fate, was formed by vorehelichen Sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a apparently unknown woman whose arms and legs can be found until the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives thanks to hands of which they are actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past years, the number of the "honorary de 'was put into the official position outside of Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch, according to this high point in 2016, the number of honorary infrastructure reached its peak; however, in Jordan, the institutional infrastructure is missing in order to support women, the victims of the murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on the breaking-breaking point of 1954, women who are exposed to a certain time in prison, "and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee of the family necessary that the woman will happen anything.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music is delighted with great popularity and is well-known for it, even before returning to swallows the country in his country long as tabu gold.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib contest it, however, that his work is politically, however, however, that he is his music, the full of explicitly played on sexuality, freedom and opinion, not far from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">He was proclaimed, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa's" Hdaib takes the question after the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" there is a focus on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are on the core in a core.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, a verse often repeated itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and any other is it too."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the songs the Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can get in his words, "what you want" - it is faith or notices, hack- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that anyone who speaks in Jordan on the rights of spondyes and readers and that comments on gender equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still in use in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordan online program ROYA to remember that his comments were torn out of the context, turns off his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without a cuts, but has only been a revised version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is open to the Arabic LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that the tolerance in homosexuals do not agree to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuclear, an poet of the eighth century, which still remained today thanks to its homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: when Abu Nuclear who work later on behalf of the potassium work, in the eighth century it was able to write about homosexuality why in Jordan he did not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The actual problem, as Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila, or the fact that the concert was said to do.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemitical Kingdom, there is nothing new more that the government attacks on the free opinion disgrazing and that progressive voices may be brought to the tail.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the national news service paid several former government officials and members of the teacher, with the accusation, they had expressed on commentaries on the commentaries on the problems faced with the deep in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of the Hdaibs concert, it is only the top of the Ice Age - the real challenge is to structural change in the next generation of Jordanier.</seg>
<seg id="2143">Mashrou'Leila is now progressing for him for the second time in a row but there is Hdaib - consists of slow, covered and inner changes. it is sure that these changes have been held in the heart of the jordan Society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib showed, like millions of other Arabs, also from an Arab world without intersubsidies abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He would not only dreams his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem, and Damascus, but also of them that "them too."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps this is the region of music, art and literature of a real and basic off-sewn - and not by bombs, streamed and unguided species to the democratic. at least he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is, Hdaib becomes desired, and therefore also make resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2152">It is believed that there is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. there is a further theory that marched from the West Japan in the northeast, in order to flee the indigenous people in the region, the Emishi, into the Knie.</seg>

<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the contribution "Liebeskind to guerillakazi" which publishes the international online magazine Tea after Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why We write only love letter to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet much more important, people who feel more to bring to him?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question went out to the two young Colombian and Cristian Palacios by the Young-Youth and Cristian Palacios campaign of the Young Artists Foundation (Letters for Reconciliation) to write the young people to write permission to guerrigs.</seg>
<seg id="2186">It was just a short time ago, her country was setting a historical event, and they wanted to contribute to a peace agreement with the guerillamovement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces), which forms the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signatories of the peace agreement was considered to be the most important that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received a Nobel Peace Prize for his merits in the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, the Colombian is still a long way, until you can talk about a real reconciliation and of peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillakazi who had lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to war rhetoric rhetoric, and around the clock, they have to integrate their weapons in the life as a civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, in turn again turned to life in constant fear and in some cases deep Hass compared to the guerrichs had to capture it in their rows and support it into construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian has to close himself and would help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And it is exactly the cities: up to now they have written thousands of young people - love-love to the former guerrichs struggles to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign are 6900 Letters - one for any former guerriflawns, which then personally be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day in inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation of reconciliation was found at the World Summit of Peace Prize, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This declared that we love the people that we love, on Valentine's Day, thousands of love letter, but those forget that they need to be far as far as you need.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He cover he told, he told his love with people who need his love with people, in this year the urgent situation.</seg>
<seg id="2198">This was the plan, letters of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC that will find their place in society and will find a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian Society is ready to make the discourse of a common history of peace in a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far the campaign had collected more than 2000 letters within the framework of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombian such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I have never thought that someone would be awarded. "</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in a UN camp in the Caldono Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the town council of Cali and Leonardo by the BogotArt Foundation in the camp to bring the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set itself, as they had previously done to take the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time she received no commands, but letters full of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all participants. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can run in just a few hours - from fear to luck, and everything that is what is" told, "told the political science student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the governors of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After the letters had handed over, led me a former fighter with the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Camal" (a kind of refuge in which the guerrichs) saw living), I saw a guerricle he wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I had to go back, because in addition to him on the bed, a MGL-Granatwerfer, a deadly weapon in the DornrÃ¶cker.</seg>
<seg id="2211">I spoke him, and asked him: "Hello, what they're just?" he said, "I answer to a letter which has written me someone.</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopelessly full of letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life, someone has never found something to me something, that response to me. "because there was suddenly the tears of tears over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I converted him very fixed and continued me next to the Granatwerfer.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps also he was the war, it was tired, all the years of faithful unto this fighting, and wanted to help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had a somewhat different from the life. he was the only way to store him and his six brothers before the famine. "I have never thought that someone would be awarded me for my error.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is outside a company, which is with open arms to us.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned to learned how to avoid with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things to learn and do in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New vote</seg>
<seg id="2221">There are students and some leaders of the FARC to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all raised as the war and the FARC already had already in obscurity.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC leader have experienced the history of ideals, ideals and gave insight into their views over the peace process. "now we have the possibility to develop us to a political party, we can contribute to a political party in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a target of this size, it is worth it to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people were to hear, who had never found a hearing and no campaign that people who had seen as a monsters, and even hassen, only people with beautiful feelings and their environment had been filmed, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, which lives in the country is me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it would go to me that all people - even those who have killed and so much damage have to be brought to us, and give us a smile, and a rearming.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many ex fighters have been responsible for letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the archbishop of the town Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Column has been made sure that after the deforestation peace would mean peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it impregnation, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, are always ready to use to buy the weapons, and for their rights to use, and this is completely righteous (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We are set up from the FARC now on peace, to a policy without arms.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore, we call all defenders of peace to - regardless of the race, religion, or ideology, spread over all the land which dreams of a land in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word to make our contribution and bring to sacrifice, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. who, among us who defend the life as the basis of the existence, many difficulties will be forthcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2237">At our way there will be many obstacles, but we will be overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two samples in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which nurtures you were placed - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, because my male name is drunk; but the doctor stood and put me to the women.</seg>

<seg id="2275">When I got his name for the first time on his leaflet, I got to do with fear, it was a musculmination, a Caucasus name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he presented itself as a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I was thankful for him that he has gone full of me with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They returned to me, wrote me - relatives, foreign, foreign, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a alpacms.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family are visited by neighbours and some remote relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The desired, to send me in Chechnya to prove that the everything was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They ordered the absurd: some told me, I must prove it by using the roads; others wanted to say that I was not changed in the official television in Grosny, and I didn't know my sex I was, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have to say baskets size C - what would I say in television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how does your family tries to go with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people spoke to my mother at the road.</seg>
<seg id="2289">She said to her, "You have brought a monster to the world, that does not only have your family, but the entire Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can not stir until you, because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she laid up a strike around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">For happiness, the neighbours and retains it came to luck.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later stood under the window a car with darkened window windows and a Nummernplate with a 95 drinkplate.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it was clear that there was something bad.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends overtook the numbers of human rights - it was found that I was pursued.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Out of safety reasons, I will not give their name to its name, but I will say that I am reminded of them; they really helped me to me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then the country was very believable.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I still cannot understand how it could not be able to realize how it was possible.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to retrieve my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them, without having to register without a reference, without giving everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke out my old SIM card and threw them into the waste.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and checkout at the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I plug the SIM card into my mobile phone card.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment, when I call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you think is not about you who get there in security, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know you know in which hotel du plug. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only around "s you have to prove it: it is the number 115."</seg>
<seg id="2311">You can imagine how do you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: stand with your family still in contact?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not hesitate to talk about the sexual intercourse, however, this is a Tabuity.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still have a few traditional casus elements, I still have been in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So very I wish to wish I wish to overcome this seam barrier, I cannot overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I tell us that, as long as my mother is in life, I will do my best do not to violate them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">If we are happy with the camera, I have actually been living out of effort, like the person who say it out of their past - thus saith to my male shape.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that's very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: know a bit about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who stayed unfolds?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington on the last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the need, I needed current information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to somebody there, who eat a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during the Ramadan did not be arrested and tortured, however, that all the end of Ramadan could not wait to wait, and he closed a new shaft.</seg>
<seg id="2327">The most likely they will concentrate on family and transformation.</seg>
<seg id="2328">That I would like to load the relatives in front of those who take care of this problem with the affected person and at the end of require a proof that the so-called "honour" by blood gentuung.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: now there are still pregnant women in these secret counties?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there are not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">When, in particular, those who have no relatives have been relatives or the relatives were left out of their relatives, Kadyrows Court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be taken there, so that they can then present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">That means: if they are taken, you will show their body in television and claim, they would have attacked any village or a military base point.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">When they were not simply disappeared as these people do not have vanished, rather specifically targeted to radically.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: this is now only a muting or have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just want to meet someone who was incarcerated in Archanger in a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people had vanished in that prison after their bart had grown.</seg>

<seg id="2341">And this so called Lord, this person was taken part, when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">However, until now they were introduced as bandits, there was so far not reports. we think that such actions are possible.</seg>

<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think, already in 2003 I was already familiar with all of it, when I had lived there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia had never applied, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much more safe than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia wanted to lead us to the civil war, and finally brought us into the stone time.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how does it possible to work under the Scharia Law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were sunk; I made coloured lashes, bore Roman eyelashes and short Tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Education of Sharia has never made me a hair only.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches took place, and the whole city knew; they were, why men, young people met there.</seg>

<seg id="2359">One says it often to reach children, making it a funny thing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply have their eyes ahead of your eyes, because they believed to believe you would be sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">You never have never done me, never finished, and never beaten never before.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long he kept these Gnadenstime?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow had entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about Moral in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He didn't talk about us per se, but priority about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, it was possible to change like the people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who, who, before, and gelatin had eight, considered you on once with Argwohn.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the period I left Chechnya.</seg>

<seg id="2381">OC Media: wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So, nature, that has purely nothing to do anything with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chetschens, who want to take you with foam before the mouth, that there is no tail coils.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagests have what the cabardiner, which have both Russians. they also have what they are - but they are not in Chechnya. "</seg>

<seg id="2424">Since functionaries and institutions are preferred to adjust the Arab labour force, the local Arab Ahwazi grows to access to workstations in all sectors.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion that was written by Ayomide, and was originally published on the site of Afro-Ã©minas. the article was the subject of several discussions, in which many different positions came to an expression.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the commentary text under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not feminist, many women - especially white women who have themselves as interseeded Feminists - with Frust.</seg>
<seg id="2438">You get rid of why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">You can even put together scientific and social arguments about me why I should be feminist and why we generally speaking all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, in spite of the same education, women still earn less than men in spite of the same education.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation, if necessary, what they may make your body with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or so that cultural and social norms are still ensuring that women sooner or later in various fields of life participated in a ginal ceiling, and that discrimination on the gender can still be spread across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I felt twice and three times.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And nonetheless, when I say to skin art, on black women in the LGBTIQ or black women from the Diaspora; if I have chosen, what kind of understanding, seeks, and burnt al movement, there were many white feminists and white interseperate feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, all women are all that women - all women - come together to go to "their vote, and" Kumbaya, "my lord 'to sing," to reach the equality (some of the women).</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about it that in addition to sexual violence, there is a institutional form of raalized violence that we are exposed to two different species.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or beyond that black women and women of other ethics and women of other ethnic groups and women are less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The black girl and girls with a migration background more often than white girls, due to obvious reasons.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spies and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk, and violence and violence in the partnership as well as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want to have all men, all men and all men. on the other hand, I can hear me as a black woman not able to take into account the white woman who refused to account for both the sex as well as to the skin of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am erect and I will not want to fight with me in a white-feminist-oriented sphere, which brought me and countless other black women and again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">In 1851 Sojourner started his speech in 1851 in her speech: "I am not a woman?" and I have weightful me to justify an idea of ideology in the black woman in historical respect to an isolated and marginal beings.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I jumpers me to join me groupings that also absorb our customs and customs, in order to strive your egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will not try to try white women on the importance of overlap of skin and sex. because some of them will continue to recover the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to leave them one better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the interseedale feminism was founded in order to give women different materials and a home from a white feminism, which is still the word "Feminism" in his name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I'm afraid, and all of the feminism will join me, and my status of feminism, which was called upon me as a white-feminist Paradigma, which is hard to use for a white-feminist Paradigma, which is so hard to be celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before we define the black women to our own ideas and we are looking forward to us from us to us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson - Weems, the author of the book of Africana, says: Recoring Ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: how we are able to create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, seeks, physical and even the spiritual elements could be admired, which account for the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intermodal feminists are immediately read, after they read them read about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman are affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a vosanist environment, I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because in this Paradigm, I have existed.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized due to my dark skin, and due to my existence, as part of this Paradigmas.</seg>

<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are really harassed at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various information and reports that are not once answering the extent of the gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers are available. however, the numbers are available.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the State Attorney's Office owned by the Attorney's Office 9600. of which 70% of them went up violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">Only 86% of the advertisements in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There was more than 5,000 advertisements in the peace violence among peace violence. here, 86% of the advertisements were women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women that they were postulated, 55% of women spoke of psychic mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics show however not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the data of the paraguan Women of State, Ana Baiardi will actually appear only a few of these criminal cases. "on every woman who will not be refunded in Paraguay because of psychic missions, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">On every woman who is refunded for physical mistreatment, two women who do not do so, "stated the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">As women's murder in Paraguay are no own tuning authorities, the complaint is not appropriate to document how many women have been murdered every year from their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Until August 2016, journalists spent at least 12 cases of women in the country alone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, all ten days in Paraguay all ten days spent a woman due to violence against men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and an legal system that keeps nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez, the fixed girlfriend of Carlos Vera, it insisted on that they called the name of all their former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning, she was not really not yet, but, however, after that. this should be one of them for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos together. but for two years she bore the psychological violence in one part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult ones:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought that I would have been victims of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2509">If I have read more about it, I thought that only women happens to be discounted that only women affected by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana took social media to report about the missions of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without any name, she wrote a posts on Facebook, in which they described his Beleic, and various attacks during their two-year relationship, and told them, as he had isolated.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people interested in their contributions, including Carlos even. he asked the rhetorically, whether he ever made his hand against them, and refused to be a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users, Mariana, why they didn't like that so long from Carlos I had left him, and didn't left him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as they wanted to say that the victims of mistreatment were at least a certain co-school.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, which did not come from Paraguay, fought in Paraguay nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that their former partner they had been harassed.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo ("I think you") who is composed of women who are in any way of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk to other experiences over their experiences, listen to each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Do you do what many others do not do: they take the statements of the women.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case all started with psychic missions.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her prosperous partner had finally managed to convince them that they were valuable.</seg>
<seg id="2522">He began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias ads during the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a trial against their former partner who developed to an unmistakable legal fight between Paraguay and its home country, mainly in money, power and the influence of their former Partners.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Threading laws: good approach, lack of implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">There are many laws that are very good, but not to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The display of missions is a way full of resistors and a struggle against corruption in the judiciary, "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organisation for women in Paraguay, looks great problems at the application of the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On August 10, 2016 a bill was discussed under the haguan Parliament under the hashtag # PorEllas (# FÃ¼rth).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# non-eWeniger) are part of a campaign on Twitter, which is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law sees how to explain Femicide on a stand-standing pensionate and harder, as it was already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the legislative text was changed in some points but also the MPs to win the law that would be banned in Paraguay that the way for decriminalisation of sample descriptions were forbidden in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill that had been planned for most of the (bureaucratic and economic) travel costs which have to be present at present themselves if they just want to enjoy and secure the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law does not exist, if the legislature is not effective when the legislature is no proper financial funds provided at your disposal:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay mistreatment is seen as part of human relations.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here is a change in memory, so that violence did not be more than anything else.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whosoever dened in view of these facts, pleaded not guilty, and bears that the perpetratory is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to refund this long display, until mistreatment is no longer regarded as normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted by the paraguan Senate. prior to the law, parts of the law had been changed. among other things a passage level, which was called the partners in cases of the reconciliation of reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes are apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section concerning the reconciliation of reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the Aggressor, his sacrifice again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The words of the words "gender," political violence "and" sexual abuse "from parts of the law applies however as a great return.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit's Club 2016 in Zambia, image is carried out in Zambia.</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is not mentioned in the media only rare or even not mentioned. this is in order to address a growing area that make one of the urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the needs of local medical research, there are two reasons: for a missing on the offer of global health, many medicines and vaccines, which cover the specific medical needs on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in the poorest countries of Africa far more extensive effects as elsewhere, and lack of investment for the investigation of these diseases are a great problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research, which is conducted by African scientists itself, with its establishment of a research capacity in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be facilitated for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>

<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. med) speaks as private people).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit's RW for the moment is the main focus of my work on the application of research results. supporting the most economical national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I have just got a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion about the important current science topics in your country and generally in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How they differ from them in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research research here. we are only put solutions that have been differently.</seg>
<seg id="2604">That must change, otherwise, we will always stay for the receiver, rather than yourself Macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get, are often used in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where is the financing and support?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is they sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult it is, suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">Projects are well supported.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who come back or here, because the financing and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are available in your routine work, which you did not had previously?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries. it costs plenty of money, a continuous power supply with electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it lasts for months to import from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: how is the opinion of the public on science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interested but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools in order to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how big is your opinion after the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should focus on demand, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all age classes.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are requirements of special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, exploration of the world, health care (non-transferable and increasing) and efficiency of traditional medicine are very profit.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the fore- and disadvantages of life as a scientists in Africa across Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, there are the limited speed, things to do, and the ability to scientific expertise gained here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines can only be accessible only against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), limited also the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers of global food production.</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post of Rachel Cernansky was originally reported on the website Ensia.com, a magazine which reported on the basis of environmental problems in the world.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton zÃ¼chtung since the 1980s in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 varieties such as Outredden, the first plant that has been cultivated by NASA astronauts in the space space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton work was only allowed through its own random number and question how many Salatables can get borders.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he observed that more salts were patented, so that they could not use the breeder.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents do not only have individual varieties, but also for specific features such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or weeds leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past years, more of such patents have been registered over to more plants such as grain or antiottenants. due to this trends, Plant-based plant-protective, environmental protective and expert for food safety for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia, Morton still reside salad, he needs to do longer, since his work is still being continued with more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is, when it would be a boulders in a river, around which I have to stumbled.</seg>
<seg id="2637">So, we have to do this, but it is a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think that this patents will go to Salate.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they hold a court, no one cannot miss a new Salateries, because all features are patented. "he makes so good as possible and trying to rearing those features.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and strive to use, no material that is protected as a geological property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a motion, which is always larger in the USA, and anywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("open source" trains).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronaut of the International Space Station ISS have bred red RÃ¶mersalat the train station "the station is bred and eaten it. there will be tested whether plants can be found in the space space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is not a coincidence that this name is rather as so, the movement of the IT sector originate and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open Source" seed ") can be inspired by the motion for free" Open Source "software, which provides alternatives to this protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to life in order to ensure that some plant species and fish are not protected as a non-term property and can be used for plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, short Ossi, as part of the initiative, US ZÃ¼ers can commit to do so that other that do not have to use seed seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This means that they do not continue to make business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeder allow up their seeds, to cross it their own varieties, and it does not agree with two aspects that are banned by many plant patente.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Nozzle: "nozzles" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emination of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi member, Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seed and the possibility of halving new plants, both important for food safety and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds play a role in major conjunctions such as Biodiversity, rights of peasants, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeder would try to use the latter only or just little to use, by taking plant seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasised that the "Open Source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented, whether vegetable, Korn, genetically modified and sustainable vegetable consumption, which is why in August or September 2016, we would like to be offered on a farmer's markets, should we know that the species is bred, as this vegetables is bred.</seg>
<seg id="2654">The nutritionity without seeds is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed initiative to pursue other seeds, others are still free at disposal. thus, in contrast, seed and plant features are patented.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters believed that the future of food supply are endangered, since the available genprizepool was due to the always-wide-sized mental potential to plant breeding material, which therefore still be reduced, non-reduced detail.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Director of Ossi, has worked in her thesis with genetic Variation at carrots and their availability. it found out that about a third of all Kartottenant features are protected as a non-legal property, making it not useable for plant breeding eders.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates are still not yet, but experts, like Luby suggests that there are plants such as wheat in even larger style, are salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of Visible</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are cultivated so that they are specifically targeted features - from such, due to their taste or their color, because of which they keep in certain environments, thrive and threats as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of Patents on plant properties show that the available plant material for breasts through more patents. genetic variety is currently than ever before, since the changed conditions are predivisible with climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-speaking in Carly Scaduto that genetic diversity is important and important for Monsanitation activities. with a total of four genres banks and the cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States, the company responsible for the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it says the view to promote other breeder, since "patents and the protection of plant professionals." a patent is basically a patent pending, which is followed by the patent for the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often, these instructions can help others to come with another method to reach the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection inhibits innovations, but does not support it by the public more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks like the different: 20 years, until a patent sequel, conveyed no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long, to plants with plants, which are adapted to the modified environmental conditions, if one could have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main house for Morton is however, that genetic resources are always good to use: "independent plant breeding eders have neither the time even the money for such formality, and monetching Anreize are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to facilitate farmers and facilitate farmers.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what we rubbing, and it will be impossible to use us if we do not continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton participated in the concept to patented plant features: "we don't create the characteristics not really.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants constitute them out of and as a breeder we finally gave up the idea how the plants do do.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding, in the US state of Oregon and Ossi member, there are another important aspect of the plant breeding: "those who bear a variety with her own values in it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believes in industrial agriculture with large underground and monocular shocks, which are needed for their growing herbicides, the farming has rearing its varieties in agriculture in its varieties.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly skilled. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that are to move on international markets, but is smaller than Monsanto) - either rests her smaller seed companies - either rests her, or hold it for too expensive and therefore it is not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton is looking for in its breeding garden Salate.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo of Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the conclusion that the gathers of plant patrol innovative would be: "it looks like to produce new efforts to produce new, more than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need to do a permanent new material for my catalogue, because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years, "he says." with a patent is being protected from competition, where it is pretty easy for about 20 years. "</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of the censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still alive the Egyptian authorities have been involved in the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time met the site of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of August 5, the Egyptian government adopted the website of the European Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt, and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network announced an opinion on Facebook that criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step, criticized the work and efforts to go on human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The "Network for Human Rights Information Available - in spite of these statutes and to give to a voice in the Arab world, so it was never so important as now. ANHRI is confirmed that all technical possibilities will be performed in order to overcome the spersing and not to be. we beharren to meet our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first major website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after which the authorities left out more than two months 21 websites, including Qatar-language version of the Huffington Post and Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera.</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation on the wave of Websews and victims. @ anhri a major data sources for Human Rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Next to ANHRI, there is also no access to the blog of the Colomnists and human rights, Ahmed Gamal Ziada no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the dissemination of Kolumba and articles that he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, he was addressed to avoid the Zensuration of the Egyptian government, even the goal of a attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider of which is native to Ziadas blog, is on the other hand, is also accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he participated in the student of a student, such as the police violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article is turning mainly to politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook commentary, Ziada went to the Spering through the government and reflect what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to sperm is very old, however, in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the lock of the blogs is not important for the world, it is not important for me for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has succeeded to communicate with me the feeling of a siege to nature; A arrest, a attempted murder, preloading in the national Security Council, the Spering Blogs as well as every other website, for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I wrote not in any other words. in other words: my words have influence, even only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used to avoid the censorship for the post of articles.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, after having locked him, and that they were afraid of the words, I still change the link or to create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mud go out the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Humanity and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06. August 133 websites. this produced technical tests in the different Internet Service Provider (ISP), including orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE documentary also documented the sperfrom providers of intergrid-censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12 we will notice as the Spering of websites, which began VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates that the government's intention to operate content to block contents, and to filters that Egyptian users could have access to Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation will be made in addition to the fact that the Zensuria can be made behind it, so that the Egyptian population has no legal situation, which they can predict against this actions in court.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question: as far, the Egyptian government is ready to go with the censorship and wen she will mature as the next attack?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants are disputed.</seg>

<seg id="2753">During the report on newspapers in Brazil, the headlines made from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous posters.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are like:</seg>
<seg id="2755">In school, "14-year-old was shot in school," each day is murdered by a police officer in Rio de Janeiro, "Dieves rause pharmacy with military weapons," President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air afee after Rio. "</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis, in the middle of the economic crisis, the violence threshold in Rio reached the highest level since 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called the United Nations to access the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are daily, and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">Thus, for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio well-known newspaper "Extra" on 16th August, "which is not normal," in which they announced a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motifs for their decision declared the newspaper:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes committed in every major city on the world, as murder, Raub, sexual crimes, etc. all that happens during the "war" War in Rio. "(...) This is our kind to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative to close as journalists as journalist not close our eyes in front of the Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, chief editor-in-chief of the newspaper, that this decision was no reason for pride, but rather a sign of the failure of the failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper on the world with a wardbrik in a country which does not recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that it will be controlled according to the information of the institute for internal safety in Rio de Janeiro 843 areas that will be controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the guiding article, the newspaper continues:</seg>
<seg id="2768">It is aware that a war discourse, when he is broken, the police can only use the police, such as the police that only use, and then ask questions to forwards.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civil population, but the economic power of Mafia and its partner.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Schawaiting the designation "war" more than they are used?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argued the journalism of the CecÃ­lia Oliveira. this is the opinion of a right-term security policy through the media and could change it to control the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - such as Extra at the analysis of military personnel in Rio himself - in combination with inadequate investments in personnel, education, and a historical and self-educated deterioration of the public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just his capital.</seg>

<seg id="2782">At the beginning, this was in fact to a decrease in violent deaths. for several years, the UPP, but after several reports on Schikanes and repression against the poor congregations, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux made from one of his article from 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio do not correspond to the name "Civil War" through the Geneva Convention.</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as war also moves serious consequences for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this, it calls for a state which are typical for a war, which is typical for a war. it belongs to the territory of a "fine of" where a civil point is an invisible point in the landscape and to the object for "collateralous damage" and "verirte balls."</seg>
