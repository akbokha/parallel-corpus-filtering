that is James R@@ isen .
they may know , because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize , because he won the New York Times re@@ porter in New York Times .
long before someone had heard by Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he released spectacular , that the N@@ SA had illegal teleph@@ ones of Americans .
it &apos;s a different chapter to leave a lasting impression .
in this manner , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c US secret services , in which the CIA was literally handed over to a nuclear bomb .
if this is crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but know if you don &apos;t know who did not have the chapter ?
the US government .
nearly 10 years the government said against R@@ isen and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he became a symbol for the pattern of the government , hist@@ leb@@ able and condem@@ n journalists and journalists .
according to the first Constitutional Court the media have the right to publish a secret information .
but it is impossible to use this right , if media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the Mu@@ tigen .
so , when the government came to R@@ isen out , he did something that many cour@@ ageous re@@ porter already said before him : he said , he said that he would prefer to go to prison .
thus , from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go into prison .
but then , only days before the process , happened something exceptional .
suddenly , although they would have been essential for years that it would be indispensable for their case , the demands of the government were dropped from R@@ isen .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ porter and sources are always hidden .
instead of troub@@ led and cra@@ mp@@ tions to the statements , that could also do his digital foot@@ steps for him .
and thus , the investigations carried out without any understanding , his telephone number , his telephone at home ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , finance and ban@@ ker , its lending information , and even travel service with the list of his flights .
in the midst of these information , they were proof of evidence they made use of Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ able and Ris@@ ens to condem@@ n it .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama spoke to protect his attacks against W@@ hist@@ leb@@ i . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ sts had more than all American governments in front of him .
now , you can imagine how to have a problem , particularly because the government has down@@ gra@@ ded as much of their work .
since the 11th of September , almost every article on national security was the result that a W@@ hist@@ ler was a journalist .
so , we put the press work on the game which may be protected by the first Constitutional because the government always has more opportunities to fill all out .
however , as the technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
and although they can record it from the moment , in which they were going into contact , rather than in the night .
today , there are communication software that there was still not yet , when R@@ isen &apos;s book had written , and it is essential as a normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such technology is the drop , an open source transmission system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ ash , which was originally developed by the internet of Aaron S@@ wart@@ z and today has been developed by the German of the Press Foundation , which I &apos;ve been developed further .
instead of an email to send an e @-@ mail , head to a news site , such as the Washington Post .
there you can also instantly upload documents or more information , as in any ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server where the following news agency has access .
so , the government does not require more information about secre@@ tly , and many of the information that would be able to challenge it .
the drop is but only a small part of the whole , protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments of all over the world will always develop new sp@@ y technologies which are all commercially available .
it &apos;s to make sure that this is not only technology , such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to bring abuse . it is just as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ an .
the supply of soldiers are modest and supervised by the soldiers of anti @-@ filled hospitals in the supply of soldiers . or the next environmental workers , the alarm , the alarm from F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ Street In@@ sider that warned us in front of the next financial crisis .
anyway , these technologies are not only made for those who want to cover the crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights .
thank you . thank You
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the largest data sheet date of the history was published . &#93; &#91; what does this week &#91; We are Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness . &#93; this week we have been sent by news about a rect@@ angle of 11 million documents of Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a little insight into the secret world of the tax phases .
we will get an impression of what customers , banks and attor@@ neys to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a go and say , &quot; ok@@ ay , we need a clear company . can you set up ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of news , as the whole system works , as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
the Prime Minister has returned .
also , there is reports that a federation of the violent Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad mail@@ ing firms in taxes phases .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children &apos;s holidays , a famous Cel@@ es@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of rich people , and others that wait to wait for the next release , and will be revealed next to the next release .
now the name of the P@@ lot of a agency un@@ ll@@ ri@@ ll@@ ers or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems to be wine from you , normal people .
why should we go to what you go ?
but the truth is : if the riding and mo@@ ons are able to hide their assets in tax phases , and not all taxes , then this means less money for major public services such as healthcare , education , streets .
and this is concerned us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
in all over the world , media and leading politi@@ cian , such as secret tax o@@ asen from some few years to be used , their assets and wear , -- something we discuss and un@@ v@@ eil the world for ten years .
I think many people appears to be very confused , and it &apos;s difficult to understand how this tax phases work .
I always always felt like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so , we have a company in another company , in a further company what it makes almost impossible to understand , who is behind this building .
it can be very difficult for the tra@@ ce@@ ability and tax authorities as well as journalists or civil society , as well as journalists or civil society .
I find it interesting that there are less reports on this issue in the USA .
presumably , since there was no prominent American Americans who came to these revel@@ ations , that sc@@ andal brought in these revel@@ ations .
now it is not so that there is no rich Americans , who hide their assets in taxes phases .
however , by the principle , after which these tax phases , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has to work less American customers .
we could have a data check by the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would like to see much more cases and examples .
in fact , it is so that in some US states , less information need to specify less information , to establish a company to get a library .
this species of the In@@ transparent in the USA has allowed workers from school districts , school children .
it allows , especially vulnerable to pl@@ enti@@ ce .
it is this kind of behaviour that happens to us all .
here , in Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out what all this in practice looks like .
how does that actually ?
so , we saw a discovered investigation into the offices of 13 attacks in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as an African ministers from the susp@@ ect of susp@@ ect money in the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked that all until an attack on our investig@@ ator had made suggestions , how he could trans@@ gression his money .
these were all pre@@ condition . none of these lawyers took us as a clients , and of course , no eman@@ cipation was handed over to the money . yet it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to view this not as individual cases .
it does not exist in order to be a single lawyer , who used our ver@@ discovered investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single @-@ peak power , wi@@ den@@ ot@@ ted in a sc@@ andal .
it &apos;s why , how the system works , by the corruption , control animals , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and in order to handle this , we must change the game rules .
we have to change the rules to change this kind of behaviour .
this may well sound very tr@@ v@@ nig , as if we could do anything , however , as if nothing would have changed if there is always the friction and mo@@ cks .
but as a born OP@@ TI@@ M@@ IST , I see that some of them started in change .
over the last few years we have seen pre @-@ tasting about more transparency , which affects the owners of companies .
the theme found political attention through the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then the EU has been recorded in central regi@@ stran@@ ds on national level , who is really behind companies in Europe , and who will receive it .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the USA are back .
representatives of both parties have taken a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this makes it not the progress that we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama &apos;s disc@@ los@@ ure , this huge insight into the world of tax phases , used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
we need common people who are w@@ ishing to see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lamps .
we need managers at the economy , which stand and say : &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for the business . &quot;
we need leading politicians , who recognize the problem and to finish this type of transparent by the laws of the In@@ transparent .
together , we can end the In@@ transparent , which now allows this type of tax zing , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story , as I was ab@@ duc@@ ted and in the trunk to a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I had completed my design studies , I made an hinter@@ land store .
a type in the red Maz@@ da stayed and look at my things .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and made just a road trip through the whole country . afterwards , he would go to the Crystal sc@@ or@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me to me , as he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
while we paid the bill that I made it to ask him : &quot; where you haven &apos;t ask him ? &quot;
he made the whole thing : &quot; I don &apos;t know it . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , Mann !
what ma@@ ch I now ? &quot;
does not know the situation does not ?
do I have to offer a sleeping area now ?
but I had just lear@@ nt met him , but he would go to the peace of Peace , but I don &apos;t know if he is really planning . I will not be ab@@ duc@@ ted in the trunk to a Maz@@ das .
this is a small trunk !
then I heard me : &quot; I have one air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
a voice in my head said : &quot; ä@@ h , as you ? &quot;
at night I was then in bed , I star@@ red at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh husband ! what I was broken with me ?
a wilderness of sitting in my living room .
what if it is crazy ? &quot;
I got a such fear that I rose up from bed , on a ten @-@ door to the door , and my sleeping room door .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact with contact .
the art work of art , which he bought from me today in his class@@ room . he is now teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has been completely changed .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as foreign minister , actually friends , who were just waiting to be discovered ?
people on my air mattress , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
we make a time jump , two years later ...
I am working unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my fellow inhabitants and the rental is increased .
I learned that there were a design conference in the city . all hotels were booked .
I believe creativity can create , fear in fun to transform .
I wrote my best friend and new people Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I posted something . our apartment is to stay in a designer @-@ bed and Breakfast . young designer can stay in our stay , free Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , including a mattress and breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created as &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super , and we also found .
I am sure that our cheese @-@ ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ ts was completely different , because we made it for our guests .
we toured with them through the whole city . as we passed our last guest , and the door fell into the castle , rigid Brian and I went to us .
we had just discovered that we find new friends to find our rent ?
the things came to rolling .
my former fellow @-@ inhabitants , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as an developers .
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept .
thus , we presented our investors : &quot; we would like to create a website on the people public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms , the species rooms , its doors is going to come .
via the internet , they can open them wild people to stay with them .
this will be the next great D@@ ing ! &quot;
we wait to waiting the ro@@ cket would be ign@@ ited .
however , it did not work .
no one who is still very close to Tro@@ st , would invest in a business to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we are all lear@@ nt have learned that foreign languages are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can see the things that you can good . we have designed to have designed .
at the Kunst@@ akademie , we had learned that design has much more than just look and hap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the total experience .
we had lear@@ nt to have learned how to have objects , but now we wanted by design substantial trust , among people who had never had taken before .
may make design such a bit ?
is it possible to create design confidence ?
I would like to give you a sample sample , which we trust our .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will be out of your comm@@ ability .
thum@@ b high , if you are ready to use .
start your mobile phone in hand .
now I would like to glad@@ ly use your mobile phone system .
enter your phone mobile phone your left seat in your left session .
this silent bu@@ stle of p@@ anic , which you go now -- -- is exactly what hosts , if they open the first time the door open .
because the only thing in your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , you can see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the operating mobile phone of a stranger going in the hands ?
most often the responsibility .
so , most guests , when they stay in the night .
only from this reason , our company exist .
only once so that Al Go@@ res is now actually Al Go@@ res mobile phone ?
could be announced on Twitter , that it is responsible for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you now have experienced what kind of confidence we want . I would like to tell you some discover@@ ies .
what would be if we have changed a small detail in this experiment ?
what if your descendants would be revealed only once with his name , when he told , from where he comes , how his dog or his children are hot ?
set out before you could have 150 Be@@ ur@@ ations that all say : &quot; he can really hold very well @-@ out mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you would like to make your mobile phone ?
for a well @-@ lasting feedback system , the confidence is decisive .
at the beginning , we still have made some things .
it was difficult for the people , negative impact departments .
finally , we decided to wait for both hosts and guest performances , before we &apos;ve made it online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people can trust in each other , depending on how they are in regards to age and residential resort .
little surprisingly we trust the people on most , that are similar to us .
depending on the differences we find , the less trust we find .
this is a natural social def@@ aul@@ ts .
it is exciting when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by irrig@@ ation departments .
if you have less than three impair@@ ments , nothing changes nothing .
but you &apos;ve got more than ten , changes everything .
a good reputation in common with good reputation .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep @-@ p@@ enc@@ es@@ ale love .
in addition , we went that confidence is dependent on how much you are of course .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if one tells you little , like for example , &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you get rather than any answer .
tells you much , like for example , &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- this is not supposed to be assumed .
there is thus an optimal degree of off @-@ off , such as &quot; Tol@@ le works in your apartment ! I am it with my family holiday . &quot;
how can you create it with design to create this degree of off ?
we use the size of the text area to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on what kind to write .
our whole company is based on hope that the right design can help to overcome our preliminary parts against foreign countries .
which we had not counting it was the great amount of people who place more than ready to put these curtains .
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first , great plenty of luck .
second , the ti@@ reless work of our teams .
third , that was not covered , previously , not covered .
we just running the business just very good .
of course there is also times when no everything runs smoothly .
there were guests , which had been celebrated or devast@@ ated by un@@ imagin@@ able party or apartments .
guests have been able to stand guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on the customer service . all calls came directly on my mobile phone .
I stand at pre @-@ front front , when confidence was broken .
there is nothing ch@@ lim@@ iting it as these calls . it does not think when I think about it .
the dis@@ appointment of having a dis@@ appointment in the voice of An@@ ru@@ fer , he and will always be our biggest motivation to improve us .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million were found only a fraction of the fraction .
because people trusted each other .
if confidence is work , the mira@@ cul@@ able can arise .
one of our guests enjoyed vacation in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host was to the hospital .
he donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is its assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travellers who have a sitting areas with heart attacks .
the area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are real prot@@ en@@ gel which save a life of life , even though they don &apos;t know it .
you have a car to hospital , if you dies , and wait , while you get a b@@ ypass tube .
because they don &apos;t want to understand that you feel free to use them .
you can leave a even longer stay without the extra @-@ nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , of course , not every stay .
but these relationships behind the pure money reaction are exactly what you want to reach the Sh@@ are Economy .
when I am proud to proud about this term , I asked me :
how does the thought of partial sub@@ actions together ?
it goes here to a economic trade .
but now it &apos;s just a &quot; rent @-@ industry &quot; you will not meet the matter .
Sh@@ are Economy describes a trade , human relations promises .
people place a part of itself , and that changes everything .
if one travels today , it is easy to compare with Fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but therefore less authentic .
what would be , however if travelling a rich buffet of local co@@ press would be ?
what would be , if at any place you visit one group there would wait for a group there , fill up a group there and a pub in a pub in a pub , of which one has never heard ;
or if you want to learn a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what would have been if we would divide the apartments from the ground ?
how would look like ?
what would have been to accept the idea of a common concern ?
I want to leave the cities with us and relations with us , instead of a sol@@ itude and sh@@ ot@@ ation .
in the South Korea of Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking , which belonged to the government .
now they were offered for the inhabitants . students who were looking for a lead in A@@ bide ,
they were conve@@ yed to people whose children were moved out . they were incub@@ ated with incub@@ ator programs .
to be able to finance new Start @-@ ups in Sh@@ are Economy , more than our platform alone will be 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries on a guest or even host .
the idea does not seem to be crazy about it , as it was given us .
we have been invented the wheel of the wheel .
we have already existed already before .
there was already similar websites in front of us .
so why did not work our work ?
in addition to luck and Tim@@ ing , we know that you can find the right design to the right design .
design can help us to overcome deep tri@@ mm@@ ed parts .
I find the aston@@ ishing ,
overwhel@@ m@@ ingly overwhel@@ ming .
I must think about any time you think when a red Maz@@ da ride past me .
of course , we know that design will not be able to solve any problem .
but if it could help us when it had this great influence , I experienced me , for we will soon be available soon .
thank you . thank You
what do you think when you see me ?
a believers ? a experts ?
maybe even a sister .
or suppres@@ sed , a brain wear under@@ gone , a terrorist act ?
or just a delay from a security check at the airport .
this is actually true .
I give you not the debt for your negative impressions .
so , the media people who like I look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative .
show : the Americans my , most of them would not know .
presumably the people are unable to talk with their u@@ ber driving .
for all those who have never learned an Muslims : it is great , you know it .
I say to you , who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ presso coffee , with cream extra .
I have been selected ,
a Mö@@ d@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ k in , Germany
and I &apos;m a practic@@ ed , spiritual Mus@@ lim@@ in .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not so born .
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as hom@@ os@@ eller man , like some of my friends , but as Mus@@ lim@@ in . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , and my head@@ ings .
my femin@@ ist friends were de@@ ferred : &quot; why did you get thee yourself ? &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist independence of independence , although I felt a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , me felt a perfect and un@@ mistak@@ able beauty deal .
I don &apos;t have happened to have been accepted by faith in my parents .
I have with the cord .
I read it , thought I thought out and believed in question , the question , and believed in the question .
my relationship to God was not love on the first sight .
it was trust and slow handle , which is deep@@ ened with any reading of the Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of rhyth@@ mi@@ k brings me sometimes to wines .
I dun@@ no myself to me . I feel that God knows me .
had you ever noticed that someone is true , you understand completely , and but somehow love ?
feels it feels .
later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as engineering in engineering .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then , the terrible morning was in September 2001 .
many of you thought about it , where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , I sat on the screen and saw the word &quot; E@@ il@@ message . &quot;
there was smoke , aircraft flew in buildings , people don@@ ors from buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical error ?
my shock is moving quickly in Emp@@ ac .
why should I do so something ?
I switched to the television channel and heard that &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terr@@ orists &quot; ... &quot; &quot; in the name of Islam &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &#91; ... &#93; ... &quot;
Oh , my God .
it &apos;s not only been attacked my country but in the N@@ u related the de@@ eds of other families in a susp@@ ects .
on the same day , we had to go through the Middle East in the USA to move into a new city and started to start studies .
I remember how I drove me -- so deep it went so deeply in my seat area , and I made me the first time to be detected as Mus@@ lim@@ in .
we moved in this night in our apartment , in a new town where it felt like a completely different world .
and then heard and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations , the brethren : &quot; you &apos;re growing at &quot; silk &quot; silk &quot; , &quot; A@@ bide in well lit areas , &quot; Ver@@ sam@@ mm@@ elt not &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week .
then , Friday in this week -- the day was dedicated to Muslims as well .
and again , the war@@ nings : &quot; goes on that first Friday , the mosque could be a target . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage of coverage .
the feelings were very distinctive , and I heard from attacks to Muslims or of people who made one for Muslims , dis@@ embark@@ ed into the Free and dis@@ embark@@ ed .
there was really Bran@@ dan@@ ic of mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not right .
because the people who had attacked this land attacked and attacked our country .
I drew the wh@@ ut of the people down to the terr@@ orists .
imagine ! I was too excited ! I was too excited .
it is not easy to declare itself .
I have nothing to questions , I love questions .
there are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today , we can say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when we are going to go ? &quot;
some people want to close Muslims , and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my municipality as by a tumor in the United States .
it is only the question : we are malign@@ ant or good ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumor act as a whole and a good tum@@ ours are only under observation .
the alternatives is sen@@ sel@@ ess , because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tum@@ ours in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are inventor and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ al and Olympi@@ oni@@ ken .
will make the closing of mos@@ ques in America ?
it will perhaps stop a few parking lot , but not the terror .
the regular visit to a mosque , to consider people of other faith @-@ toler@@ ant , and larger civil representatives .
and how me was the head of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told : people will actually not be radi@@ ated in mos@@ ques .
they are stored in a computer or in a bed in front of a computer .
we noted that it &apos;s online . as a result , the person &apos;s person is cut to a brain way , even from their family , that the person is believed that the person who say the terr@@ orists had the true Muslims , and everyone who are given their ideas and their ide@@ ology .
when we want to avoid radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some are still claim@@ ing that Islam was a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS owned its brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
when Mus@@ lim@@ in , as man , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would like to add to its performance world , when you recognizes it as a representative of 1.6 billion faithful .
thank you !
the IS has so much with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ K@@ Lux Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim@@ ing their ide@@ ology grounds on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
but if you have a look at it , they do not miss it , what they do in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot;
it is her brut@@ ality that they can read them into the script .
an outstanding image , I told me a amazing history :
a girl came to him because she would like to join the IS .
I was really surprised , and asked him whether they had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said , the problem was exactly the contrary . every cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken it , and said that her wrath , her meaning for the dis@@ appearances in the world , it would only bring to trouble .
nothing inspired and something that would have been given to their W@@ ut sense , she was a main target for the instrumental in the extre@@ mi@@ sts who spoke to her a solution .
this Ima@@ m the connection to God and her municipality again .
instead of them , instead , it demonstrated its construc@@ tive way for a real change in the world .
what she met in the mosque , she im@@ migr@@ ated to the IS in front of the IS .
this was a insight , like the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family affects .
but how does it acts on normal Americans ?
how does it works on any other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day on our democracy , because of our freedom ?
a study -- actually shows several neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ ence studies -- if we want to fear for at least three things .
we accept a author@@ it@@ ative government system , conformity and performance parts .
a study shows : if you report test persons , which was negative , in which negative over Muslims was reported , they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circum@@ c@@ ision of the rights to American Muslims .
this is not only an acute problem .
when you look at when the mood against Muslims after the above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this is three times , but never happened in connection with terror attacks .
it happened on the prior to the Ira@@ k@@ war and the two elect@@ oral periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem @-@ terror , as I have expected it .
it is actually a tool to prevent the manipulation of the public in order to imp@@ ose the foundations of a free society , who has reasonable and informed citizens .
the dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we recommend it maybe as the first , but the toxic air of fear will be given us all .
in the assignment of collective debt , there &apos;s not only about how to explain themselves .

his sister would say to me that he knew the sweet , a generous man , who knew it .
she visited him there , and he revealed his life . it was amaz@@ ed and said :
&quot; when is from my bre@@ der@@ lein such an experienced young man ? &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ zanne , her brother and his wife , has murdered them , just like the sister of Yus@@ or , Raz@@ or , who had to visit the afternoon . he did it in their home , as he did when he had led against Muslims on his Facebook page .
eight times on De@@ ah .
Fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be killed not only about moral , but also mort@@ ally .
thus back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we went to the mosque , or stayed safe at home ?
we glad@@ ly pra@@ ises it and for us it was no light decision to get to our children : one who would like to control our kids , or one , in which we can exercise our religion .
we opted for the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove up with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , and went out my shoes , went to prayer all , and what I saw , let me hold me .
the hall was rest@@ less .
then , the Ima@@ m did a announcement about it , because the half of the killed Christians were Christian , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , A@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who had come to attack , but to help us .
in this moment I was broken .
these people were there , because they had courage and experience a sensation .
what are you choose ?
what are you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will go to no longer ?
or you are connected to those that my : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thank you !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have a Ner@@ v .
but I ask myself what if you &apos;re talking about what you might claim that you have a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thinking that works in a no@@ tion of thinking , i.e. an exception and not the rule .
do you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , not dec@@ eive you . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am so usually , as it is allowed .
if one can look back on the Muslims in the whole world , and I did , with the biggest ever known study on the world , people want to be normal things .
you want to have prosperity to the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so , I have no exception in any respect .
if people usually appear as an exception , then often the rule is broken , and they are not the exception to the exception .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what a platform for home construc@@ ts began , shortly before that , to become a real estate .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial use . made possible in research facilities worldwide .
before the air package in our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of flight machines at Fra@@ c Centre in France has built live a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they started to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting external devices , high speed and acceleration on the smallest capacity can be connected .
you can also build up self @-@ oper@@ able structures too .
they learned to bear loads of loads , to react with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally to react to nature .
today we would like to show you a few of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possibility of autonomous flight .
in order to work a system autonomous , it must know , where mobile objects must be found in the room .
in our lab at the ETH Zurich , we are often used external cameras to focus objects . that allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s Dem@@ os we use a new locomotive technology from Ver@@ ity studios , an arrangement of our laboratories .
there is no external cameras .
each flight machine has an internal sensors to determine the position in the room , calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands is available on the highest layer . for example , &quot; start and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight machine , which tries to beat two F@@ lies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters it is efficient , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most of the starter , it is sulph@@ ur@@ bs , and it has great benefits of start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a swe@@ eping side .
a limitation by rear @-@ star@@ ters that it is sensitive to tur@@ bul@@ lets such as wind ar@@ ches .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight machine does matter in the location the optimal position and improves performance by practic@@ ing .
ok@@ ay .
during our research we provide fundamental abstract questions that penet@@ rating the nucle@@ us of the thing .
such a question was for example : what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to want to know the answer to a such question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand mo@@ vable parts , which refers to viol@@ ate .
after decades of decades , trained pilot @-@ controlled air@@ planes were fly , which had only two moving parts : an prop@@ eller and rear @-@ box .
in long discovered we discovered that F@@ lies with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , a mechan@@ ically simplified control device . it was invented in front of short films .
it has only an mo@@ vable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no folding , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ der , no further drive Drives or am@@ bi @-@ controlled areas , only a prop@@ eller .
even though it is mechan@@ ically easy , it happens in the inner life very much , so it can be stable , and can move in the room .
nevertheless it is not yet equipped with the elegant algorith@@ m of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to get there , I must be exactly right .
the probability , it is exactly right , if I feel right , is low , why I was filmed a video that was filmed last night .
if the Mon@@ osp@@ a is a exercise in Gen@@ ü@@ gs@@ am@@ ity , this machine is the machine with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in over@@ flow .
what do with all this over@@ flow ?
you see that he only symmet@@ ri@@ cally symmet@@ ri@@ cally .
for this reason , he is ambi@@ ance of his works in its orientation .
thus , he receives the overall ordinary capacity ,
to move in the room in all directions , no matter what it is filmed or even as he has been .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers by the eight prop@@ ellers .
some is already adjustable in models , the rest is learned directly during the F@@ lies .
we see that at the same time we see .
if flight machines should be part of our everyday life , it must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made of two separate two @-@ prop@@ ellers machines .
these turns into clock@@ wise
and the other against the clock@@ wise direction .
if one builds them , they are like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ru@@ cop@@ ter .
however , however , something is wrong - a motor or prop@@ eller is made out of the electronics or a battery - the machine can fly even if limited .
we are now demonstrated that we are able to make a half flight .
the last demonstration was investigated by a synthetic gun .
the greatest number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we took the usual Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than a disc bread -- and out@@ fit it with loc@@ alis@@ ing technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where it is in the room and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hop@@ efully this demonstrations you want to think of new revolutionary ideas in memory .
the especially safe machine , because in the Broadway , on the Broadway , there are a frequent lamp .
of course , it is difficult to declare the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the reward is in development and the Schaff@@ ens@@ ity .
it serves as a memory , as wonderful and enchanting our universe , and that it allows creative , smart phones , allows them to form a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such a massive commercial and economic potential , is the sh@@ adows on the i .
many thanks .
just 1.3 billion years ago , in a very far distant gal@@ axy , two black holes are always faster , you should make the mass of thir@@ teen in a tenth of a ten@@ ths .
it has a short moment , brigh@@ ter than all the stars together in all gal@@ axi@@ es of the entire universe .
it was a very great Kn@@ all .
its energy is not included in the form of light free --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was made into the room @-@ time emotions himself , and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
furthermore , we arrange the events at first time .
before 1.3 billion years ago , it was just a multi @-@ cell life in the earth .
since then the earth has brought some earth : coral , fish , plants , sau@@ ces , people and -- God understand us at -- even the internet .
some 25 years ago , a group of especially mu@@ te -- R@@ ai is looking for a huge laser det@@ ector of MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the C@@ alt@@ ech -- to search for gra@@ vit@@ ation waves , which arise for the black holes .
it counted it on the basis of it .
but enough people knew them as crazy gen@@ ius , so that the U.S. National Science Foundation is financi@@ ally financed its idea .
after decades of development , design , design and extremely much har@@ ter work , they built the Det@@ ector L@@ IG@@ O : the laser inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ry @-@ observ@@ atory @-@ Observ@@ atory .
in the following time , the precision of L@@ IG@@ O could significantly increased , which improved the impact performance .
therefore , it is called Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
in early September 2015 L@@ IG@@ O was launched for a last test run in order to clari@@ fy some smaller , hard drive problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the det@@ ect@@ ors , the gra@@ vit@@ ation profil@@ ing of the two col@@ li@@ fic black holes through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than that :
my daughter
and the fare@@ well from my to@@ d@@ kran@@ ian father .
basically the fruits of my life @-@ work were the fruits of my life .
all that I worked for this , is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist on the MIT . he has studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and its observ@@ atory like L@@ IG@@ O measuring signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ation waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a herbal time in the feelings of space and time .
at the end of the shaft , the room will be the room and his total content into a direction and put into the other .
in order to illustrate the viewing conditions , lecturer in c@@ sen for Rel@@ ativity theory often have a correct dance .
the edge and du@@ g , on the edge and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even imm@@ ed .
on 14 September , for example , every of us the waves in the waves came and stri@@ ped . the expansion of an average people was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is , 20 Nul@@ len according to the Kom@@ ma , followed by a 1 . thus , the L@@ IG@@ O employees have declared .
with a five kilometres long laser det@@ ector , and that &apos;s already absur@@ d , the length should be measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ ths of a nuclear power . this is gro@@ tes@@ que .
at the end of his classic text on Gra@@ vit@@ ation
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical problems in the construction of such det@@ ectors are ra@@ ped .
but physi@@ cist are fin@@ alized and with the support of the public will be overcome all obst@@ acles . &quot;
in 1973 , Thor@@ ne published his success in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott claims , L@@ IG@@ O is more a ear than one eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around : view , the size of your mobile phones .
that &apos;s quite convenient . for example , you can create a picture or a map of things by taking the coming from multiple points .
in tones , the different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
therefore it is very tough , actually impossible to create a picture of things that mean you great deal of :
on the face of your child &apos;s face .
instead , we have instead of certain properties like sound and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now speaks Alice &quot; . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob under@@ breaks them . &quot;
&quot; Dum@@ mer Bob . &quot;
the equ@@ als is valid for gra@@ vit@@ ation waves .
we can do with them not a simple images of objects in all .
but by using changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to us their stories .
at least are available for L@@ IG@@ O the measured frequencies in a read@@ able area .
so , when we convert , in Sch@@ all , we can hear the all @-@ literally .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation to tep@@ id , about a lot about coll@@ ision of two black holes , which had my colleague Scott already very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , zir@@ pen : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two body very fast , one cannot hear the same cir@@ cus with an additional sound change . that &apos;s how to do it with : W@@ u @-@ O@@ sc@@ anners @-@ wu :
it is a kind of motion sensor , integrated into the wave form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- one date , which I never forget - heard this : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ s of the device : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ s of the device : ... two black holes with 30 rounds of sun mass , which as fast as the rods of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : then we are superior to us what this means .
two black holes , the most densely bodies in the All , one with a mass of 29 Son@@ am , the other with a mass of 36 son@@ ata , converted into a hundred times a second before they en@@ code .
make these forces before .
fantastic .
and we know it because we have heard it .
it consists of constant importance of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O eb@@ net a completely new way to the investigation of the Al@@ ls as they never had previously possible .
on this way , we can listen to all the things and listen to the invisible things .
much in all , we can not see - virtually or fundament@@ als -- you don &apos;t see .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why to explo@@ res stars in super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . of them we have learned much about the All .
the exciting physical signs will be happened in the core , which is behind the kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon hidden .
we will never see that this op@@ ak are never seen .
Gra@@ vit@@ ation profil@@ ing iron , as if it would be transparent glass . the urine would like to explore the first minutes of the Al@@ ls , but we will never see them , since the urine can be covered by its own sm@@ ashing lights .
it should be possible to look back up to the beginning of the gra@@ vit@@ ation process .
and the most important : I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things that we never have never seen , which we will never have never have any performance . things that we only discover that we are listening to .
in fact , L@@ IG@@ O took place in the first start of things that we had not expected .
my colleague in MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says that : Me are the type of stars , the black holes , as L@@ IG@@ O they are observed , are the Din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , old body from prehistoric times . the black holes are the sau@@ ces of the sau@@ ces for our ar@@ cheological work .
L@@ IG@@ O gives us a completely other eye @-@ view angle of the events in All , on the emergence of the stars and finally , as we went out of that chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be as easy as possible .
thanks to L@@ IG@@ O , we know how to get great det@@ ectors , and the noise and circulation of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atory -- a brand new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and the All .
for what could be more beautiful , than the Ur@@ ch@@ all itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you . thank You
I a experiment with experiment in front of some time .
for a year , I would say to all , &quot; Yes , &quot; before whom I made me .
no matter whether it made me nervous , me in un@@ pleasant situations , I asked me to tell me &quot; Yes . &quot;
I wanted to talk to the public ?
no , but yes !
I wanted to be live in television ?
no , but yes !
I wanted to start playing the play ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly that I do , w@@ ov@@ or I fear@@ ed to fear that my fear .
my fear , to keep my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
my life has changed my life .
me &quot; yes . &quot;
but there was a particular yes that my life changed my life , on an unexpected art . it started with a question of my young .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the most beautiful , calls out of un@@ explained reasons .
when she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; Evalu@@ ator , I needed to make milk for my be@@ ak . &quot;
she asked me to me whether I could play with her playing , when I was just the jump . &quot; and I said , &quot; yes &quot; . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from as to fluctu@@ ated me , always with them , as soon as you come to me . no matter what I am doing , or when I go , I say to Yes - every single time .
almost . I wasn &apos;t perfect , but I be@@ amed me very .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , on our family .
but it also has an aston@@ ishing out@@ action : just recently , I am really complete that the &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ S@@ agen for games with my children delivered my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am the author . I think about things out of w@@ inged out the life .
your dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
your dream job .
I C@@ ire TV . I produced a television television .
I watch TVs , in large style .
in this TV season I am responsible for this , 70 hours programme into the world .
four TV channels , 70 hours TV . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
every shipment offers hundreds of jobs that have not been existing .
the budget for a episode of a TV channel can vary between three and six million dollars .
say five .
a new episode has four days , four TV channels , four TV channels , four episodes , four episodes , and four episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes . : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes of episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours Television ,
$ 350 million for a season .
in America , my TV series will run on Thursday evening on Thursday evening .
around the world run my series in 256 languages in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is globally , and 45 this 70 TV @-@ hours are broadcasts that I have not created , and not only produced , so I have time to tell you time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours TV , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires , which around the world .
know who still does this ?
no one , so I am a Titan .
your dream job .
I want to print out my attention . I would like to impress you .
I say it because I know what you think if the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I say to you , so if I say to you , a country or a class@@ room , a business or a class@@ room , so I don &apos;t understand that I don &apos;t know only on the computer or un@@ imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true if I say , I am sure that there are not a dream job .
it &apos;s everything a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , all silence -- no tears .
I work lots , hard and I love it .
if I &apos;m too deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work makes it a land out of the gene .
it is , when I put troops on a painting , when I went on a canvas .
as a dream of sound you have a high sound , you &apos;ll find a marathon .
how Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é is feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that is at the same time .
I love it to work .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and con@@ spic@@ uous , funny and mat@@ ernal , cru@@ mb@@ h , and reasonable , cru@@ el and reasonable . and the best of it is the sums .
there is so a change in me when working well runs .
a sums starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sums of the sums are like an animated road , I could go for ever .
many people take if I have the Sum@@ mon , that I have over@@ write the writing , that writing to me is joy .
understand me , don &apos;t understand me .
but the sums up -- when I started to work with television production when I started to work and work to create , create , create and work , I discovered this thing this sums .
the sums is more than writing .
the sums is action and activity . the sums is a drug .
the sums is music . the sums is light and air .
the sums is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have a sums , then you can not save differently than the size .
the feeling that could not be different when the size is to stri@@ ve , no matter , at which price .
the sums of the sums .
or maybe it means also be a work@@ horse .
perhaps , Genie is gen@@ ius .
maybe it &apos;s E@@ go .
maybe it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know it .
I know only that I have done for the failure , and I know knows that I love the sums .
I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I will not want to put it in question .
in order to say one more detailed information , ever more inter@@ actions , the more recent limits , the more work , the more work gives the more work , the more things more things , the more could me , the more no more than I &apos;m history , the more expectations are there .
ever I work to work in order to be successful , the more needs to work me .
and what I said about work ?
I love work , not true ?
the country , which I for@@ bid , the marathon which I &apos;m running , the army , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums .
I like this sums . I love the sums .
I needed the sums of the sums . I am the sums .
I am only this sums ?
and then stops the sums .
it has revised , over@@ charged , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , burnt out .
the sums stops .
now my three daughters arrived to the truth that her M@@ ama is a single work Institute .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my M@@ ama will not be there , but you can write my N@@ ann@@ y . &quot;
and Emer@@ ald says : &quot; Schätz@@ ing , I would like to go to Sh@@ onda Land . &quot;
there are the children of an Tit@@ les .
you are baby Tit@@ anen .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sums up heard .
the sums of the engine was cont@@ ested .
I loved my work . I didn &apos;t love my work .
the sums came not back .
my sums was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same titles working work , 15 hours @-@ day , no Reu@@ ben , no Reu@@ e , nothing deleg@@ ate , there is no evil , don &apos;t work with all the heart , clear eyes , as well as always .
but there was no sums .
in me it was quiet .
four TV channels , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV channels , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a pre @-@ show Titan ,
everything was grey , I didn &apos;t have fun more .
and this was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sums and the sums was the sums up and the sums was .
what makes you what if you want to do the work , who love you love , suddenly ?
I know , some sort of memory : &quot; Heu@@ l thee , bl@@ ad@@ der author @-@ Titan . &quot;
but you know , you &apos;ll need to be a teacher , a painter , who love to be one another , and that is one of the sums , if one knows the sums it , and knows how to make the sums it only , if the sums come back , who is you one thing ?
what are you ?
I am ?
I still always have a Titan ?
when the song of my heart beat , I cannot survive in the silence ?
and then I will make my &quot; southern states &quot; with a question .
I am on the way to the outside , late , and she says : &quot; M@@ ama you play ? &quot;
and I already wants to say to me , when I will have two things :
first , I must said Yes at all , and secondly , they called not called me . &quot;
she calls out more &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot;
when is the result ?
I have p@@ asse when I am Titan &apos;s and my sums , and this changes everything before my own eyes .
and so they said , &quot; M@@ ama you play ? &quot;
and I say , &quot; yes . &quot;
nothing is special .
we play and their sisters , let &apos;s say much , and I &apos;m quite dramatic from the book &quot; Ever@@ y@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; in front of the book &quot; Ever@@ y@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; .
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my p@@ anic , in the lon@@ el@@ iness and in the place of the sums , I can &apos;t make anything else to fit apart .
I am focus .
I &apos;m quiet .
the country , which I sh@@ ear , the marathon which I &apos;m running , the army , the screen , the high sound - they exist no longer .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky finger and humid , delicate , w@@ sm@@ al@@ sti@@ cker and the song , in which it goes on , or what is the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air on this place is so short that I cannot leave anyone .
I cannot believe that I am me .
play the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something is dissolved .
a mental door continues and come in for an energy boost .
and that happened immediately , but it happens , it happened .
I feel it .
the sums is slowly back .
no full volumes , hardly ever , it &apos;s quiet , hardly ever , but it &apos;s there .
not the sums , but a sums .
and now I feel that I would know a magic secret as I would know .
but let &apos;s stay at the thing .
it &apos;s love . that &apos;s everything .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it &apos;s something that we have forgotten .
the sums of sums , the work environment , the Titan@@ po@@ ets , which is only of replacement .
if I ask you if you &apos;re aware , who I am , if I am me , when I am working with the help of broadcasting and TV hours , and how working my brain then I for@@ got to do what the real sums is .
the sums is no power and it is not working specific .
it is a pleasure depending on the pleasure .
the real sums is depending on the love .
the sums is the electricity , which comes from the living conditions .
the real sums is self @-@ awareness and peace .
the real sums are ignored the pressure of the story , which is to perform , the anticip@@ ation and pressure .
the real sums is simple and original .
the real sums is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but maybe w@@ alled me God the wrong words , because God said to me that I am a Titan &apos;s ?
it &apos;s just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
once my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I make it a fixed rule , so I can &apos;t release me as a work@@ horse of any gu@@ ilt .
it is law that I have no other choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice when I want to hear the Sum@@ men again .
I wish it would be so simple . I wasn &apos;t good in games , I like it .
play me not ans@@ at@@ as , as they work .
the truth do is an truth ,
but I don &apos;t want to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I am staying at the workplace as a pack .
this single document is painful , because what a man works better than to be a house ?
well , I am .
hon@@ est@@ ly hon@@ est@@ ly , I get myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have trouble .
that I &apos;m too , is one of them .
we rapid and back in the garden , before and back , and her .
we make small dance parties ,
we will sing and play Ball .
we sm@@ ashed Sei@@ fen@@ bl@@ eman in Sei@@ fen@@ bl@@ eman .
I feel mostly stiff , ab@@ sent and confused with me .
I always moved to my mobile phone .
but it is O.@@ K .
my children show me how to live , and the sums of the universe must be fulfilled .
I play games and games , I ask myself : why we have heard with the games ?
you may also see it ! say they always want to play with you when your child want to play with you .
maybe you stop me for n@@ ai@@ v , for a day job .
since you probably have quite right , but you can also do it !
you &apos;ve got time !
and know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child is going to be less interesting , as you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me , and up to them , that they want to make anything else .
it are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , I will replace a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or K@@ eks .
and speaks my teen@@ age daughter whole 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , no need it needs .
everyone can bring 15 minutes a piece , even on a Schle@@ an La@@ une day !
15 minutes !
no phone , no ling@@ erie , no de@@ but@@ s .
the day is short : dinner , your children are ready to finish your children .
but 15 minutes are in the middle !
my children are my cow@@ or@@ ase , my world . don &apos;t have to be the children . it is not to feel the sums up to have a place for his sail@@ ors .
it &apos;s not about games with the own children . it goes to joy ,
for &quot; games &quot; in general .
you can enjoy the 15 minutes !
you will find what you do good .
you will find it out and store it out .
I am not perfect in it . I &apos;m lucky and I finished victories . friends meet , books , day , --
&quot; &quot; &quot; you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just for everything that I was my first TV show when I was my first TV show when I wanted to exceed me more and more .
15 min at the piece , why does not play a full 15 minutes ?
what can be it wrong ? nothing !
the sums came back in my leisure time . the sums seems to return , when I am not work .
work does not work without games .
it &apos;s time to come into a couple of months , but I find me in my office again . I listen to a unknown mel@@ ody , they met me and my soul . the sums up the sums up again . I use it in full power and love my work again .
I like the sums , but I love it not .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sums , the sums is not ... no more .
Sei@@ fen@@ bl@@ eman and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends .
this is now my sums .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
the sums of the work is part of me , but only a part . and that I am grat@@ eful for this .
it is me of me that I am a Titan bin . I never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes at less work and to play more games .
and nevertheless I have everything in the grip . my brain is still functional . my bon@@ fires still burn .
the more I play , the lucky , I and my children .
ever more I play , the more feel I feel a good mother .
the more I play , the clear is my head .
the more I play , the better work I am .
the more I play , the more listen to the sums . the country , which I for@@ bid , the marathon which I change the forces , the great sound , the sums , the sums , the sums of the sums , the sums of life : the sums of life .
ever more I feel this sums , the more makes this unusual , mighty , bare and new life @-@ experience in me wide . less Titan -- More I !
and if I feel exactly this sums , the more knows I am , who I am .
I am the author . I think me things from me , I w@@ inged out the life .
that is part of the job , which means his dream .
that is the dream of this Jobs ,
for a dream job should be a little toler@@ ated .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; said to less work and to play more games .
Tit@@ les have no chance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you nice .
I am Neuro@@ surgery .
like most of my colleagues , I &apos;ve got to do every day with human tra@@ ilers .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a severe stroke rate , or after a auto@@ un@@ case .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geon , it is highly fruity that the brain , in contrast to other body organs , has a very low capacity to the self @-@ profit .
after a severe injury of the central nervous system the patients often have a constant , difficult disability .
that is probably the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ sur@@ gin .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tried to improve the nervous functions through various surgical interventions .
certainly it belongs to one of the most famous , the &quot; deep @-@ cell stimulation , &quot; which impl@@ anted an electric de deeply in the brain to affect the switching circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function improves itself .
it &apos;s really an amazing technology . it improves the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , which suffered under severe citrus and heavy pain .
but not Ne@@ uro @-@ healing , however , is not Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of neuro@@ sur@@ geon is the recovery of the brain .
my opinion has to approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close to .
with a little help can help himself in the brain .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time , I was head of the head office and worked in the not@@ ing day .
in often , I frequently used patients with Schä@@ del @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma .
you need to imagine that at Schä@@ del @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ mat@@ a , brain and cran@@ ial pressure decreased .
in order to save the life , you need to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure pressure .
it is necessary to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass as well .
instead of the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analy@@ ze us with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass .
what my I mean ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissues .
this is no light task .
to leave cells from a tissue piece , is comparable to all small children who are out of your families .
you need to find the correct diet , temperature , moisture , and environments you need to leave it .
we had to make it with these cells .
after many attempts to search it Jean @-@ François .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
this was a surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly as such as a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
maybe you know from the bi@@ ologic classes that stem cells are in@@ complete cells that can transform itself in any cell type of body .
the adult brain stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in operation .
we made another fascinating control : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are un@@ matched .
but these cells were kept differently .
they spread slowly and after a couple of weeks she died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population which saw as stem cells , but were different .
we needed a long time to understand what they came .
they stem from these cells .
these blue and red cells are hot Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have done it in our brain .
it is 4 % of our large @-@ stag cells .
you play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us , they provide the brain for the brain .
but why do they stay for us ?
we don &apos;t know .
we believe that they will participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher levels close to brain ab@@ uses .
however , this is not so safe .
one thing is however clear - of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand before a potential cell source , which enables the brain to brain .
we had to prove .
so we decided to develop a experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass in the non @-@ language area and then the cells exactly as cul@@ tured , as it Jean @-@ François did
and they were then coloured , in order to follow it in the brain .
in the last step we impl@@ anted it on the basis of the same individual individuals .
we call the aut@@ ologist transplan@@ tation -- car transplan@@ t transplan@@ t .
one of our first questions was : what happened when we happen to normal brain tissue in brain tissue ? and what will happen when we move the same cells into brain tissue in brain tissue ?
with the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we could work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we observed the cells in a healthy brain and we observed that she would be returned to a few weeks ago , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they will not disappear when they disappear .
in the second scenario , we added a violation and impl@@ anted exactly the same cells and now , the cells were preserved ne@@ sted out of neur@@ ons .
here you see , what we could see under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were impl@@ anted .
the proof that they show , are these small points . these are the cells that we went in vitro , in the culture .
we could not hear of course , of course , of course .
the cells also help to recover from a brain injury ?
therefore , we inher@@ ited monkeys with an manual act task .
you had to take a feed pellets from one tablet .
they did very well .
when they achieved a stable dex@@ ter@@ ation level , we were able to handle the motor mot@@ ex to the motor mot@@ ex field .
then the monkeys thought that they were not able to move their hand anymore .
just as it happened in humans , they re@@ covering spontane@@ ously up to a certain extent , just as after a stroke .
the patients are trained and then try to recover them with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . you are able to recover a certain degree , just like the monkeys .
when we were sure that the A@@ ffe achieved his degree of spontaneous recovery , we impl@@ anted his own cells .
on the left , they see the monkeys , re@@ sum@@ ed spontane@@ ously .
it is about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
see now , when we re@@ impl@@ anted the cells : the same A@@ ffe , two months after the maturity .
I can say you , that were also very exciting results for us .
since this time we have found much more about these cells .
we can use them and later use them and later .
we can use them in other neu@@ ropath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease models .
but our dream is still always interested in people to impl@@ anted human beings .
I really hope that I can soon show you how to heal the human brain the means , to heal the human brain .
many thanks .
Bruno Spengler : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , which is wonderful , I am sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority of memory : &quot; I know someone who need to need . &quot;
I definitely have any case .
of course , the question is what the largest obst@@ acles are start before you can start clinical studies on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obst@@ acles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one must fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to fill this type of studies .
BG : this is under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of pati@@ ence and a almost professional team .
BG : check out in the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . when she continues to look into the future , how many years it takes to come into hospital , and will be available for this treatment .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
it initially depends on the approval of clinical trial .
will allow us to start the authority to start soon ?
then you must perform this study with a small group of patients .
it &apos;s just a long time to select the treatments and evaluate the treatments , whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that , one must apply to a multi @-@ centric study .
one must first really think that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for your visit to T@@ ed and that you told us .
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
we make in the west make a big mistake , to view it as of course .
we see the democracy is not as the frag@@ ile plant , which she is in reality , but as inventory of our company .
we nei@@ gen to consider it as an un@@ altered plum@@ age .
we believe that capitalism leads to democracy .
this is true .
Lee ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ mer in Beijing have proved that it is possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth while the policy remains un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy is in fact that democracy is going to us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece re@@ presented -- the new Minister for Finance in the Euro@@ Group un@@ mistak@@ able that the democratic process of our country has not been able to affect the savings , which were in Greece developed in Greece .
in this moment , I thought that there could be no better support for Lee ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my abundance of friends , which would be repeated that the democracy would be abol@@ ished when they would change .
at this point , I would like to introduce an economic model for a real democracy .
please , together with me , to believe that Lee ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ Group announced a mistake to believe , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ensive democracy .
for without democracy , our companies are moving to one , our future no@@ zzles and our great , new technologies .
on the subject of disappearance I want to contrary to an interesting contra@@ diction point , that is currently being threatened by our business teams .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; twin twin Summit &quot; Par@@ ad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot;
the summit is known . you know it and recognize it as the Schul@@ den@@ berg , who comes its long shade over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the Schul@@ den@@ berg ,
but just a few can recognize its Z@@ ones .
a mountain of wast@@ ed cash , which belongs to those who would have to invest in prison where it would have to carry out and income , with whom we could carry out the debt , and all those things could produce , who need the kind of mankind , for example , &quot; green &quot; energy .
I suggest them to them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3.4 trillion US Dollars were invested in the United States , in all the prosperity of goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office building , schools , streets , sor@@ row , equipment , and so on .
3.4 trillion dollars sounds after much money , except it compar@@ es with the $ 5,@@ 1 trillion US dollars , which were around the same time in the same countries , and that absolutely nothing else , except the stock up and the real estate prices are highly regarded .
such a debt and un@@ productive capital , the twin twin summit , which are not the same due to the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the United States , Japan and Europe , and therefore will not invest in a final statement that could do not invest . just like Ö@@ di@@ pus father , who could be afraid , the prophecy of the O@@ rac@@ ite could be true that his son will kill him , when he will grow .
un@@ dil@@ ated the circumstances which leads to circumstances which lead the furnaces .
that is my ha@@ dern with capitalism --
its extremely low @-@ product art . All the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our life and develop especially all the technologies to finance , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the rescue of the earth .
is thus democracy the solution ?
I believe already . but before we continue driving : what we understand that we are among democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the social form , in the open air and arms to control the government as a majority .
the ath@@ en@@ sic Democracy joined many of --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be an error , the importance of the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy due to this discharge .
the decision on the ath@@ ani@@ ties of democracy , and it is not only the right to exp@@ ir@@ ation , and it is not only the right to free of opinion , but it is important and crucial to them the right to political cooperation with the same mood in the state of State .
the ath@@ en@@ sic democracy is not held long --
like a cand@@ le , which is very bright , it is even burnt out quickly .
however , our current Secretary @-@ democr@@ ats have not have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the US Constitution .
while the ath@@ en@@ sic democracy is concentrated on the free citizens and the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the Magna Cart@@ a , which was a set of ruling for ruling .
for the liberal democracy occurred only when a full separation of policy and economy is possible and the democratic process on the policy , while the economy -- so the world of concert has been a democr@@ ati@@ cal zone .
in our present day , since the time of which these separation from politics and economy began , an in@@ consistent struggle between the two and the economy gradually migr@@ ated to the politics by the economy .
wonder how the politicians had no longer like earlier ?
it is not possible to degeneration of their DNA .
it lies that one cannot be in the government today , however , not to power , because the power of politics into the economy is emigr@@ ated and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my ha@@ dern with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is in about such as a herd of rob@@ atic animals , so the animals , of which they proved to feed them , that they had to be star@@ ved at the end of this year .
it is similar to the economy that concerns the policy so far . however , the power of the concert is growing , political goods will be de@@ emed to invest political products , the overall economic demand and the Managing Director of the concert are to be anxi@@ ous to invest in their company in cash .
according to capitalism , the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; came from democracy , the higher the twin gods , and the greater the disappearance of human labour force and the prosperity of mankind .
if it is true , it is obvious that we must bring the policy and the economy again , and it would be better when the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; will retain , as in the ancient country , apart from the case of slaves , the women and the foreig@@ ner .
by the way , this is no new idea .
the Marxist Lin@@ ke already had an idea already 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t feel good .
the doctrine of the Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union was to be that the working poor only should be re@@ incar@@ nation by a mi@@ racle , such as in the ancient country , without new species of brut@@ ality and disappearance .
but there is a solution : the working poor !
capitalism are it by making low @-@ grade , and replaced with automation and robot .
the problem is that long economy and politics are separated , the automation process can be lower than the twin gods , the disappearance , and the social conflicts , as it is - already very soon as I think in countries like China .
so , we have to unite the economy and the areas of economy and politics again , and to ensure that , in an anti @-@ hyp@@ er Hyper@@ cr@@ ative , the film &quot; Matrix &quot; like a documentation is released .
so , the question is not whether the capitalism has brought the technical achievements , which he has brought to survive --
the more detailed question is whether the capitalism is similar to &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; similar to those who go to the universe in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks with the sense of life .
I believe we might be optimistic .
so , what does it look like it could look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ like D@@ yst@@ ro@@ scopy ?
in practical implementation , I would like to tell you shortly , some examples include .
in the area of companies : please make a capital market before you find money in which you &apos;ll find money in the next post , by a company to the next , and the company - no matter what you &apos;ve just works - is the property which currently works in the company .
then all income from capital and rede@@ em the concept of the wage work is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction from which the company belong to work , but the company does not work , and employees who are not part of the company there . no de@@ bit more between capital and work , no major g@@ aps between investment and savings , and finally does not affect the twin twin summit .
in the field of global political economics : make sure that our national currencies had a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global digital currency , which will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group &#93; of 20 biggest emerging markets &#93; , issued in interest of all mankind .
make sure that the whole world trade will be tra@@ ded in this currency , we call them &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; in units from &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays a sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or trading income of the respective country , into a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world , in which the fields of investment are .
this is no new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes was suggested by John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time , the technical means I did not implement the technical means .
today , we have found it in particular against the background of a re @-@ compatible Policy and economy .
the world that I give you the enemy , in which they are preferred persons , and mar@@ x@@ ing , because they were buried in the tr@@ ash@@ can of history and work in the tr@@ ash@@ can of history , and ke@@ yn@@ esi@@ ze , globally ke@@ yn@@ esi@@ ze .
but above all other , it is a world , where we can imagine a real democracy .
we are w@@ aking in such a world .
or are we decrease in a &quot; Matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ ro@@ scopy ?
the answer depends on how we decide to decide together .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic .
thank you . thank You
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you get your biography in your biography itself as liber@@ té Mar@@ xi@@ sts .
today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ vi@@ is : if any of what I have just said , Marx will be relevant to Marx .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and business is ... T@@ un we do not know that the technological development will produce a massive decline in the overall economic demand , making Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long term St@@ agn@@ ation . &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis in a part of the earth to the next , as we see it currently , it will not only be our democratic dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ ze , but also the countries whose interest to liber@@ aler democracy is low .
if this analysis is , Marx &apos;s relevant , then Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , so I have a liber@@ ate Marxist , and like key@@ nes , and therefore I &apos;m completely in@@ s@@ wir@@ l .
BG : indeed , and now we are probably also available .
Y@@ V : if one is not confused , if you don &apos;t know enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophi@@ cal explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said . BG : in your lecture mentioned in Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Red@@ ner you have very clear , what you keep from the point of view to China .
do you want to repeat this here ?
Y@@ V : there is a large size of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liber@@ als democr@@ ats we have the attack of a democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited the democracy to the policy , while the area where most of the business , -- the area of the economy -- a completely democr@@ atically elected zone .
in certain respect , when I say the so @-@ called pro@@ oc@@ ative , China is similar to China today of the 19th century .
for -- -- let &apos;s remember to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , historically important .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stuart Mill --
he was especially sk@@ ep@@ tically , which affects the democratic development .
what are now possible in China , resem@@ bles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now illegal to do what the West in the 19th century itself , rie@@ ve ra@@ ped to Heu@@ chel@@ ei .
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ ers was curious about your experiences as the finance ministers of Greece in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I found that the coming comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of 2015 ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view@@ point , and very dis@@ appoint@@ ing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro area .
not only Greece , but the euro area ,
namely , by the deduc@@ tion of that , and the di@@ gesti@@ ble appeal is that a massive reduction in the Eurozone through the Eurozone , and continue to reduce the development of the entire European Union massi@@ vely .
we had the opportunity to date , on the basis of the Greek front - the way , the first sugges@@ tion was supposed to pay attention .
it &apos;s right to make . unfortunately the powers of the euro area , within the European group , will continue to vote .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if one tried to obtain a economic system that is not covered , by political will and art guitar at the life , you may have a while , but if the change occurs , he happened and destro@@ y@@ able .
BG : what change you see ?
Y@@ V : there &apos;s no doubt that the euro zone does not have any future when we change it .
BG : haven &apos;t made any error in your time as a financial officer ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who look back -- Ern@@ est ...
if there is a Minister for Finance , or any minister , after 6 months in the office , especially in a so @-@ called situation , he claims no error , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest error was to grant the application for the extension of the school program at the end of February .
I believed that there was a honest interest in the money to find a common solution .
but that there was not .
they wanted to walk only our government , only because they wanted to deal with the gra@@ dations that ran through the euro zone .
she wanted to be noted that she has led a cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ half programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
because the &quot; Great Depression &quot; is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
none of the Tro@@ ika of the monetary policy which has imposed us this policy : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal@@ er error . &quot;
BG : despite all the effects , despite the aggressive T@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite right per @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone , compared to Yemen , who lives and loves love .
my greatest fear is that the euro zone does not survived .
for if they did not survive , the acqu@@ itted fli@@ cker forces are destroy and destroy the European Union .
this will not operate alone for Europe cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c consequences , but for the whole world economy .
we are probably the most powerful economy in the world .
if we want to beat the way of a post@@ modern 1930 , which it appears to be it , it will be as far as to the future of Europeans like the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , many thanks , that you were at T@@ ed .
Y@@ V : thanks .
most of the Roy Price will never have never been part , although it is probably responsible for 22 @-@ sized minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision to hit the Roy before three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior executive of Amazon Studios .
the TV production company from Amazon .
it is 47 years old , slim , has an icon and describes on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for this shows , shows the shows and the content to produce the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard around in the industry .
there are already so many TV series that Roy do not select any extra TV series .
it must find shows that are very good .
in other words , it must find shows that you can find the right at this bend .
this curve is the evaluation of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows of this review .
your show is rewarded with nine and higher , this one is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows such as &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that make it one season , your brain asks : &quot; where there are more of these episodes ? &quot;
this type of show .
on the left side , here at this end , shows such as &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- which should tell you enough that goes on this track at the end of the curve .
Roy Price does not hesitate to get to the left side of the curve , because I don &apos;t need a special intelligence to under@@ going &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts on the mean follow @-@ up , the average TV - the shows that neither well bad are not bad , they were not yet easy .
so he must ensure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is also the first time that Amazon makes it something like a bit .
he wants to create successes .
he needs a guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition .
he performs many ideas for TV shows and select an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and features online where they can look at any charge .
and if needed , otherwise , there is certain things that you are right ?
in addition , these episodes can spread over this episodes .
however , it does not know that they are observed during tigh@@ tening of these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team , which will absorb everything from Roy and his team .
you capture how to start the show when you get p@@ aus@@ ed , what parts of it out or once again .
in order to collect millions of data to decide with these data then the show you have to produce .
indeed , they collect these data , process , and this is the answer , and this is the answer : &quot; Amazon was to make a Sit@@ Com about four Republi@@ can US transmitters . &quot;
they made this show .
knows the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; alpha House &quot; but it seems that there is no many of these show because they did not so good .
it is just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the Word -- because the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lan@@ o at 7.5 -- so something about the average , but not just that of which Roy and his team worked .
about the same time at another company , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programme design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy has always be found on the search for this one Super show , but he also uses data for it , but it makes it slightly different .
instead of a competition , he and his team have committed the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x spectators , so the reviews , they give them the shows , their course , which shows you like etc .
then use this data to find these small details about the audience : what shows they like , what producers , what actor .
when they had all the parts together , they took a car to have a car and decided to make a Sit@@ Com via four must@@ ators , but a drama Series over a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has one hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; House of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly there , where they wanted to go .
of course is the question : what happened here ?
one has two very com@@ it@@ tive , data sealed companies .
you connect this many data and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is what ?
because the logic should be somehow states that that it should work with all .
if you collects millions of data , for a decision to turn it , then you should make a good decision to make the right choice .
it has 200 years of statistics as a Back @-@ Up .
it has been optimized with very powerful computer .
the Min@@ de@@ ste , what you can expect , is good television , or ?
if data analysis does not work so if data analysis does not work , because we live in a time , in which we live more and more to statistics to meet serious decisions , far beyond the television .
knows how this is the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that is even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes in touch with this software . come in contact with this software , you are in contact with this software .
if someone asks here in the United States in jail and to un@@ release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a mission is performed or not .
just as with Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad , it will be decided whether a person is good or bad .
central television , 22 minutes , which may be a bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately there is evidence of evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results were created . this does not remember that a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
even the data can be reversible @-@ in companies .
yes , even Google makes sometimes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it was predic@@ tions by data analysis , the ra@@ cial of flu , predic@@ tions can say - by data analysis of the Google research .
it was wonderful and was a great news reports . the success is in a release in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it works fine , year around year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work yet ,
and no one could say why .
it didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ unification of the release in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data can be experienced companies like Amazon and Google have sometimes something .
despite all these mistakes the data presented data into the decisions of life a -- on the My Computer on law , in medicine .
so we should prefer to ensure that data are helpful .
I know many difficulties with data . I work on the computer @-@ assisted gene@@ tics -- a territory where some very smart people do not make many data to meet serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer @-@ therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I detected some pattern about the difference between the successful decisions on the basis of data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
need to solve a complex problem , do you see mainly two things :
when creating this problem in its individual parts , so you can analy@@ ze the individual parts ; as second , you set the individual parts again to summ@@ ari@@ ze a resolution .
sometimes , you have to do this times , but there are always two things : apart and again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help you change the problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to add the parts back in time and then to come to a decision .
for this there is another tool and we own all : our brain .
if there is something that the brain is good , it &apos;s parts and plays together , even if the information is not complete , but if the information is not completely to summ@@ ari@@ ze - especially if the brain is one of experts .
therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and delay , where it also belong to the process .
they use the data to understand their audience better . but the decision how to take all these parts , go back and put an show like the House of Cards , which is not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they went into a great personal risk with this decision .
to Amazon , on the other hand , however , this is the false way .
they us@@ eless data to control all their decisions , first as they chose TV @-@ ideas w@@ ett@@ ed , then as they voted &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show .
it was a safe decision to say because they could always say , &quot; says the data . &quot;
it didn &apos;t want to get a desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things are wrong when data will start to control our decisions .
no matter how ma@@ cht@@ fully they are , data is only a tool used , and in order to forget that this device is pretty useful .
many of you will be ...
before it gave data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions using a J@@ ing or N@@ ein @-@ question you have to shake the ball to get a answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here in this moment .
I &apos;ll be a real estate later with a technology demo .
so I &apos;ve met some decisions in my life , and I would have to listen to the ball on the ball .
however , as you know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace these data by a little bit sophisticated , as data analysis , to meet better decisions .
but this does not change the basic design .
so maybe the ball well as well as well as well as well as well . finally , it lies to meet decisions that you want to reach the right at the end of the right corner .
and I want to take this as a very encouraging message that , despite the great amount of data is still paid , decisions expected to be an expert in which what you do , and risk to go .
because at the end , it is not the data but the risks , with which you encounter at the right end of the curve .
thank you nice .
