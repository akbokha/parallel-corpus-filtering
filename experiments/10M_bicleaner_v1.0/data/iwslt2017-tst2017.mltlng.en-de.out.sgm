<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They may know, because he won the Pulitzer Prize, because he won the New York Times reporter in New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard by Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he released spectacular, that the NSA had illegal telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's a different chapter to leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this manner, he describes a catastrophic US secret services, in which the CIA was literally handed over to a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If this is crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But know if you don't know who did not have the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nearly 10 years the government said against Risen and asked him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became a symbol for the pattern of the government, histlebable and condemn journalists and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first Constitutional Court the media have the right to publish a secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to use this right, if media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the Mutigen.</seg>
<seg id="14">So, when the government came to Risen out, he did something that many courageous reporter already said before him: he said, he said that he would prefer to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thus, from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the process, happened something exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they would have been essential for years that it would be indispensable for their case, the demands of the government were dropped from Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporter and sources are always hidden.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of troubled and cramptions to the statements, that could also do his digital footsteps for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And thus, the investigations carried out without any understanding, his telephone number, his telephone at home,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, finance and banker, its lending information, and even travel service with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of these information, they were proof of evidence they made use of Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistlebable and Risens to condemn it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama spoke to protect his attacks against Whistlebi. but instead, the judicists had more than all American governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now, you can imagine how to have a problem, particularly because the government has downgraded as much of their work.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since the 11th of September, almost every article on national security was the result that a Whistler was a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, we put the press work on the game which may be protected by the first Constitutional because the government always has more opportunities to fill all out.</seg>
<seg id="28">However, as the technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And although they can record it from the moment, in which they were going into contact, rather than in the night.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software that there was still not yet, when Risen's book had written, and it is essential as a normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is the drop, an open source transmission system for Whistlebash, which was originally developed by the internet of Aaron Swartz and today has been developed by the German of the Press Foundation, which I've been developed further.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of an email to send an e-mail, head to a news site, such as the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can also instantly upload documents or more information, as in any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server where the following news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So, the government does not require more information about secretly, and many of the information that would be able to challenge it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The drop is but only a small part of the whole, protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments of all over the world will always develop new spy technologies which are all commercially available.</seg>
<seg id="38">It's to make sure that this is not only technology, such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to bring abuse. it is just as important that we protect the next Whistan.</seg>
<seg id="39">The supply of soldiers are modest and supervised by the soldiers of anti-filled hospitals in the supply of soldiers. or the next environmental workers, the alarm, the alarm from Flint. or a WallStreet Insider that warned us in front of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">Anyway, these technologies are not only made for those who want to cover the crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you. thank You</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the largest data sheet date of the history was published.] [what does this week [We are Robert Palmer of Global Witness.] this week we have been sent by news about a rectangle of 11 million documents of Mossack Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a little insight into the secret world of the tax phases.</seg>
<seg id="44">We will get an impression of what customers, banks and attorneys to companies like Mossack Fonseca go and say, "okay, we need a clear company. can you set up?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of news, as the whole system works, as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Prime Minister has returned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also, there is reports that a federation of the violent Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad mailing firms in taxes phases.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children's holidays, a famous Celeslists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people, and others that wait to wait for the next release, and will be revealed next to the next release.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now the name of the Plot of a agency unllrillers or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be wine from you, normal people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we go to what you go?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the riding and moons are able to hide their assets in tax phases, and not all taxes, then this means less money for major public services such as healthcare, education, streets.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this is concerned us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politician, such as secret tax oasen from some few years to be used, their assets and wear, -- something we discuss and unveil the world for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people appears to be very confused, and it's difficult to understand how this tax phases work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always always felt like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So, we have a company in another company, in a further company what it makes almost impossible to understand, who is behind this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for the traceability and tax authorities as well as journalists or civil society, as well as journalists or civil society.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are less reports on this issue in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably, since there was no prominent American Americans who came to these revelations, that scandal brought in these revelations.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there is no rich Americans, who hide their assets in taxes phases.</seg>
<seg id="65">However, by the principle, after which these tax phases, Mossack Fonseca has to work less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">We could have a data check by the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would like to see much more cases and examples.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some US states, less information need to specify less information, to establish a company to get a library.</seg>
<seg id="68">This species of the Intransparent in the USA has allowed workers from school districts, school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It allows, especially vulnerable to plentice.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behaviour that happens to us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here, in Global Witness, we wanted to find out what all this in practice looks like.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that actually?</seg>
<seg id="73">So, we saw a discovered investigation into the offices of 13 attacks in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as an African ministers from the suspect of suspect money in the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked that all until an attack on our investigator had made suggestions, how he could transgression his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all precondition. none of these lawyers took us as a clients, and of course, no emancipation was handed over to the money. yet it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to view this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It does not exist in order to be a single lawyer, who used our verdiscovered investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single-peak power, widenotted in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It's why, how the system works, by the corruption, control animals, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And in order to handle this, we must change the game rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to change this kind of behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may well sound very trvnig, as if we could do anything, however, as if nothing would have changed if there is always the friction and mocks.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born OPTIMIST, I see that some of them started in change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the last few years we have seen pre-tasting about more transparency, which affects the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention through the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then the EU has been recorded in central registrands on national level, who is really behind companies in Europe, and who will receive it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA are back.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have taken a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this makes it not the progress that we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama's disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax phases, used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need common people who are wishing to see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlamps.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need managers at the economy, which stand and say: "Intransparent is not good for the business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians, who recognize the problem and to finish this type of transparent by the laws of the Intransparent.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can end the Intransparent, which now allows this type of tax zing, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I was abducted and in the trunk to a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I had completed my design studies, I made an hinterland store.</seg>
<seg id="98">A type in the red Mazda stayed and look at my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made just a road trip through the whole country. afterwards, he would go to the Crystal scorps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me to me, as he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">While we paid the bill that I made it to ask him: "where you haven't ask him?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing: "I don't know it."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, Mann!</seg>
<seg id="106">What mach I now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Does not know the situation does not?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping area now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I had just learnt met him, but he would go to the peace of Peace, but I don't know if he is really planning. I will not be abducted in the trunk to a Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me: "I have one air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said: "äh, as you?"</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was then in bed, I starred at the ceiling and thought: "Oh husband! what I was broken with me?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wilderness of sitting in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if it is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got a such fear that I rose up from bed, on a ten-door to the door, and my sleeping room door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact with contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The art work of art, which he bought from me today in his classroom. he is now teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has been completely changed.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as foreign minister, actually friends, who were just waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my air mattress, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">We make a time jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am working unemployed, almost pleite, my fellow inhabitants and the rental is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there were a design conference in the city. all hotels were booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can create, fear in fun to transform.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new people Brian Chesky: "Brian, I posted something. our apartment is to stay in a designer-bed and Breakfast. young designer can stay in our stay, free Wi-Fi and a desk included, including a mattress and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created as "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we also found.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure that our cheese-ham-Omelts was completely different, because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. as we passed our last guest, and the door fell into the castle, rigid Brian and I went to us.</seg>
<seg id="134">We had just discovered that we find new friends to find our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came to rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former fellow-inhabitants, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as an developers.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">Thus, we presented our investors: "we would like to create a website on the people public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms, the species rooms, its doors is going to come.</seg>
<seg id="139">Via the internet, they can open them wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next great Ding! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We wait to waiting the rocket would be ignited.</seg>
<seg id="142">However, it did not work.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still very close to Trost, would invest in a business to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we are all learnt have learned that foreign languages are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you can see the things that you can good. we have designed to have designed.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie, we had learned that design has much more than just look and haptics -- it's the total experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learnt to have learned how to have objects, but now we wanted by design substantial trust, among people who had never had taken before.</seg>
<seg id="149">May make design such a bit?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample sample, which we trust our.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will be out of your commability.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumb high, if you are ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="154">Start your mobile phone in hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to gladly use your mobile phone system.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your phone mobile phone your left seat in your left session.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent bustle of panic, which you go now -- -- is exactly what hosts, if they open the first time the door open.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing in your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, you can see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the operating mobile phone of a stranger going in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most often the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So, most guests, when they stay in the night.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only from this reason, our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only once so that Al Gores is now actually Al Gores mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could be announced on Twitter, that it is responsible for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of confidence we want. I would like to tell you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What would be if we have changed a small detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your descendants would be revealed only once with his name, when he told, from where he comes, how his dog or his children are hot?</seg>
<seg id="170">Set out before you could have 150 Beurations that all say: "he can really hold very well-out mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you would like to make your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">For a well-lasting feedback system, the confidence is decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning, we still have made some things.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for the people, negative impact departments.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait for both hosts and guest performances, before we've made it online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people can trust in each other, depending on how they are in regards to age and residential resort.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly we trust the people on most, that are similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">Depending on the differences we find, the less trust we find.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social defaults.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by irrigation departments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three impairments, nothing changes nothing.</seg>
<seg id="183">But you've got more than ten, changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation in common with good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deep-pencesale love.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we went that confidence is dependent on how much you are of course.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If one tells you little, like for example, "Hi!," you get rather than any answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">Tells you much, like for example, "I have problems with my mother" -- -- this is not supposed to be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="190">There is thus an optimal degree of off-off, such as "Tolle works in your apartment! I am it with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to create this degree of off?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text area to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on what kind to write.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company is based on hope that the right design can help to overcome our preliminary parts against foreign countries.</seg>
<seg id="194">Which we had not counting it was the great amount of people who place more than ready to put these curtains.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First, great plenty of luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our teams.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, that was not covered, previously, not covered.</seg>
<seg id="200">We just running the business just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there is also times when no everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests, which had been celebrated or devastated by unimaginable party or apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Guests have been able to stand guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on the customer service. all calls came directly on my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stand at pre-front front, when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing chlimiting it as these calls. it does not think when I think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment of having a disappointment in the voice of Anrufer, he and will always be our biggest motivation to improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million were found only a fraction of the fraction.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trusted each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">If confidence is work, the miraculable can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests enjoyed vacation in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host was to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is its assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers who have a sitting areas with heart attacks.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real protengel which save a life of life, even though they don't know it.</seg>
<seg id="218">You have a car to hospital, if you dies, and wait, while you get a bypass tube.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to understand that you feel free to use them.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can leave a even longer stay without the extra-nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, of course, not every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money reaction are exactly what you want to reach the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I am proud to proud about this term, I asked me:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of partial subactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It goes here to a economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">But now it's just a "rent-industry" you will not meet the matter.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade, human relations promises.</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of itself, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If one travels today, it is easy to compare with Fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but therefore less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would be, however if travelling a rich buffet of local copress would be?</seg>
<seg id="232">What would be, if at any place you visit one group there would wait for a group there, fill up a group there and a pub in a pub in a pub, of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you want to learn a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What would have been if we would divide the apartments from the ground?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would have been to accept the idea of a common concern?</seg>
<seg id="238">I want to leave the cities with us and relations with us, instead of a solitude and shotation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In the South Korea of Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking, which belonged to the government.</seg>
<seg id="240">Now they were offered for the inhabitants. students who were looking for a lead in Abide,</seg>
<seg id="241">They were conveyed to people whose children were moved out. they were incubated with incubator programs.</seg>
<seg id="242">To be able to finance new Start-ups in Share Economy, more than our platform alone will be 785 000 people in 191 countries on a guest or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea does not seem to be crazy about it, as it was given us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have been invented the wheel of the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">We have already existed already before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There was already similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did not work our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">In addition to luck and Timing, we know that you can find the right design to the right design.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deep trimmed parts.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find the astonishing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Overwhelmingly overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I must think about any time you think when a red Mazda ride past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design will not be able to solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us when it had this great influence, I experienced me, for we will soon be available soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you. thank You</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you see me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believers? a experts?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a brain wear undergone, a terrorist act?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay from a security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I give you not the debt for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So, the media people who like I look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Show: the Americans my, most of them would not know.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably the people are unable to talk with their uber driving.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never learned an Muslims: it is great, you know it.</seg>
<seg id="268">I say to you, who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso coffee, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I have been selected,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Mödegern-Fitness-fanatikerk in, Germany</seg>
<seg id="272">And I'm a practiced, spiritual Muslimin.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not so born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as homoseller man, like some of my friends, but as Muslimin. I decided to wear the Hijab, and my headings.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were deferred: "why did you get thee yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time, it was a feminist independence of independence, although I felt a 17-year-old, me felt a perfect and unmistakable beauty deal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I don't have happened to have been accepted by faith in my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have with the cord.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought I thought out and believed in question, the question, and believed in the question.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship to God was not love on the first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow handle, which is deepened with any reading of the Korans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythmik brings me sometimes to wines.</seg>
<seg id="285">I dunno myself to me. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Had you ever noticed that someone is true, you understand completely, and but somehow love?</seg>
<seg id="287">Feels it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began, like all good Egyptians, my career as engineering in engineering.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the Egyptian-American dream. "</seg>
<seg id="290">Then, the terrible morning was in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you thought about it, where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, I sat on the screen and saw the word "Eilmessage."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, aircraft flew in buildings, people donors from buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical error?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock is moving quickly in Empac.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do so something?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched to the television channel and heard that "..." Muslim terrorists "..." "in the name of Islam"... ""... "[...]..."</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It's not only been attacked my country but in the Nu related the deeds of other families in a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to go through the Middle East in the USA to move into a new city and started to start studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I drove me -- so deep it went so deeply in my seat area, and I made me the first time to be detected as Muslimin.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved in this night in our apartment, in a new town where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations, the brethren: "you're growing at" silk "silk", "Abide in well lit areas," Versammmelt not "" "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then, Friday in this week -- the day was dedicated to Muslims as well.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again, the warnings: "goes on that first Friday, the mosque could be a target."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage of coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were very distinctive, and I heard from attacks to Muslims or of people who made one for Muslims, disembarked into the Free and disembarked.</seg>
<seg id="311">There was really Brandanic of mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who had attacked this land attacked and attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I drew the whut of the people down to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was too excited! I was too excited.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to declare itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing to questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today, we can say people: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When we are going to go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to close Muslims, and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my municipality as by a tumor in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: we are malignant or good?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor act as a whole and a good tumours are only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives is senseless, because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumours in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventor and teachers, Ersthal and Olympioniken.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will make the closing of mosques in America?</seg>
<seg id="331">It will perhaps stop a few parking lot, but not the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit to a mosque, to consider people of other faith-tolerant, and larger civil representatives.</seg>
<seg id="333">And how me was the head of the police in the area of Washington, DC recently told: people will actually not be radiated in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are stored in a computer or in a bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">We noted that it's online. as a result, the person's person is cut to a brain way, even from their family, that the person is believed that the person who say the terrorists had the true Muslims, and everyone who are given their ideas and their ideology.</seg>
<seg id="336">When we want to avoid radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam was a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS owned its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">When Muslimin, as man, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would like to add to its performance world, when you recognizes it as a representative of 1.6 billion faithful.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much with Islam as the Ku-KLux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claiming their ideology grounds on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But if you have a look at it, they do not miss it, what they do in their "Holy Scripture."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is her brutality that they can read them into the script.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding image, I told me a amazing history:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she would like to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised, and asked him whether they had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said, the problem was exactly the contrary. every clergy with whom she had spoken it, and said that her wrath, her meaning for the disappearances in the world, it would only bring to trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Nothing inspired and something that would have been given to their Wut sense, she was a main target for the instrumental in the extremists who spoke to her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam the connection to God and her municipality again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of them, instead, it demonstrated its constructive way for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she met in the mosque, she immigrated to the IS in front of the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was a insight, like the Islamophobia me and my family affects.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it acts on normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it works on any other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day on our democracy, because of our freedom?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually shows several neuroscience studies -- if we want to fear for at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept a authoritative government system, conformity and performance parts.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if you report test persons, which was negative, in which negative over Muslims was reported, they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of the rights to American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an acute problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">When you look at when the mood against Muslims after the above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this is three times, but never happened in connection with terror attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened on the prior to the Irakwar and the two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem-terror, as I have expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It is actually a tool to prevent the manipulation of the public in order to impose the foundations of a free society, who has reasonable and informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We recommend it maybe as the first, but the toxic air of fear will be given us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective debt, there's not only about how to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both the school went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental medicine, talented, much more...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he knew the sweet, a generous man, who knew it.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there, and he revealed his life. it was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is from my brederlein such an experienced young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne, her brother and his wife, has murdered them, just like the sister of Yusor, Razor, who had to visit the afternoon. he did it in their home, as he did when he had led against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">Eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be killed not only about moral, but also mortally.</seg>
<seg id="378">Thus back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we went to the mosque, or stayed safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We gladly praises it and for us it was no light decision to get to our children: one who would like to control our kids, or one, in which we can exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We opted for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat, we drove up with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and went out my shoes, went to prayer all, and what I saw, let me hold me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then, the Imam did a announcement about it, because the half of the killed Christians were Christian, Jews, Buddhists, Atheists, believers and non-believers who had come to attack, but to help us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In this moment I was broken.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there, because they had courage and experience a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="389">What are you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What are you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will go to no longer?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or you are connected to those that my: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have a Nerv.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I ask myself what if you're talking about what you might claim that you have a TEDTalk, a thinking that works in a notion of thinking, i.e. an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">Do you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, not deceive you. I'm totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am so usually, as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If one can look back on the Muslims in the whole world, and I did, with the biggest ever known study on the world, people want to be normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">You want to have prosperity to the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So, I have no exception in any respect.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people usually appear as an exception, then often the rule is broken, and they are not the exception to the exception.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What a platform for home constructs began, shortly before that, to become a real estate.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial use. made possible in research facilities worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before the air package in our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of flight machines at Frac Centre in France has built live a six-metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting external devices, high speed and acceleration on the smallest capacity can be connected.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build up self-operable structures too.</seg>
<seg id="412">They learned to bear loads of loads, to react with turmoil and generally to react to nature.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you a few of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possibility of autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order to work a system autonomous, it must know, where mobile objects must be found in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our lab at the ETH Zurich, we are often used external cameras to focus objects. that allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's Demos we use a new locomotive technology from Verity studios, an arrangement of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There is no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has an internal sensors to determine the position in the room, calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands is available on the highest layer. for example, "start and" land. "</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight machine, which tries to beat two Flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the starter, it is sulphurbs, and it has great benefits of start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a sweeping side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation by rear-starters that it is sensitive to turbullets such as wind arches.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight machine does matter in the location the optimal position and improves performance by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we provide fundamental abstract questions that penetrating the nucleus of the thing.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question was for example: what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to want to know the answer to a such question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand movable parts, which refers to violate.</seg>
<seg id="434">After decades of decades, trained pilot-controlled airplanes were fly, which had only two moving parts: an propeller and rear-box.</seg>
<seg id="435">In long discovered we discovered that Flies with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, a mechanically simplified control device. it was invented in front of short films.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only an movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No folding, hinges and cross-ruder, no further drive Drives or ambi-controlled areas, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Even though it is mechanically easy, it happens in the inner life very much, so it can be stable, and can move in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless it is not yet equipped with the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to get there, I must be exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability, it is exactly right, if I feel right, is low, why I was filmed a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Monospa is a exercise in Genügsamity, this machine is the machine with its eight propellers, an exercise in overflow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">You see that he only symmetrically symmetrically.</seg>
<seg id="445">For this reason, he is ambiance of his works in its orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thus, he receives the overall ordinary capacity,</seg>
<seg id="447">To move in the room in all directions, no matter what it is filmed or even as he has been.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers by the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is already adjustable in models, the rest is learned directly during the Flies.</seg>
<seg id="450">We see that at the same time we see.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flight machines should be part of our everyday life, it must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made of two separate two-propellers machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">These turns into clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise direction.</seg>
<seg id="455">If one builds them, they are like a high-performance quadrucopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, however, something is wrong - a motor or propeller is made out of the electronics or a battery - the machine can fly even if limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We are now demonstrated that we are able to make a half flight.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration was investigated by a synthetic gun.</seg>
<seg id="459">The greatest number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took the usual Micro-Quadcopter -- each single weighs less than a disc bread -- and outfit it with localising technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where it is in the room and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully this demonstrations you want to think of new revolutionary ideas in memory.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially safe machine, because in the Broadway, on the Broadway, there are a frequent lamp.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to declare the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the reward is in development and the Schaffensity.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, as wonderful and enchanting our universe, and that it allows creative, smart phones, allows them to form a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such a massive commercial and economic potential, is the shadows on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">Just 1.3 billion years ago, in a very far distant galaxy, two black holes are always faster, you should make the mass of thirteen in a tenth of a tenths.</seg>
<seg id="470">It has a short moment, brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very great Knall.</seg>
<seg id="472">Its energy is not included in the form of light free --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was made into the room-time emotions himself, and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Furthermore, we arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">Before 1.3 billion years ago, it was just a multi-cell life in the earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has brought some earth: coral, fish, plants, sauces, people and -- God understand us at -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">Some 25 years ago, a group of especially mute -- Rai is looking for a huge laser detector of MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech -- to search for gravitation waves, which arise for the black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">It counted it on the basis of it.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people knew them as crazy genius, so that the U.S. National Science Foundation is financially financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, design and extremely much harter work, they built the Detector LIGO: the laser interferometry-observatory-Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following time, the precision of LIGO could significantly increased, which improved the impact performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">In early September 2015 LIGO was launched for a last test run in order to clarify some smaller, hard drive problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detectors, the gravitation profiling of the two collific black holes through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than that:</seg>
<seg id="489">My daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my todkranian father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically the fruits of my life-work were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I worked for this, is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on the MIT. he has studied gravitational waves from black holes and its observatory like LIGO measuring signals. but what are gravitation waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a herbal time in the feelings of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">At the end of the shaft, the room will be the room and his total content into a direction and put into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">In order to illustrate the viewing conditions, lecturer in csen for Relativity theory often have a correct dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">The edge and dug, on the edge and dust. "</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even immed.</seg>
<seg id="498">On 14 September, for example, every of us the waves in the waves came and striped. the expansion of an average people was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is, 20 Nullen according to the Komma, followed by a 1. thus, the LIGO employees have declared.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometres long laser detector, and that's already absurd, the length should be measured on less than a thousandths of a nuclear power. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text on Gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of LIGOs, the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical problems in the construction of such detectors are raped.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicist are finalized and with the support of the public will be overcome all obstacles. "</seg>
<seg id="504">In 1973, Thorne published his success in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claims, LIGO is more a ear than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around: view, the size of your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">That's quite convenient. for example, you can create a picture or a map of things by taking the coming from multiple points.</seg>
<seg id="509">In tones, the different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore it is very tough, actually impossible to create a picture of things that mean you great deal of:</seg>
<seg id="512">On the face of your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we have instead of certain properties like sound and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "now speaks Alice". "</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "and Bob underbreaks them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"Dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The equals is valid for gravitation waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can do with them not a simple images of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by using changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to us their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least are available for LIGO the measured frequencies in a readable area.</seg>
<seg id="521">So, when we convert, in Schall, we can hear the all-literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to tepid, about a lot about collision of two black holes, which had my colleague Scott already very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, zirpen: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two body very fast, one cannot hear the same circus with an additional sound change. that's how to do it with: Wu-Oscanners-wu:</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of motion sensor, integrated into the wave form.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- one date, which I never forget - heard this: [Surrens of the device: [Surrens of the device:... two black holes with 30 rounds of sun mass, which as fast as the rods of your Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: then we are superior to us what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the most densely bodies in the All, one with a mass of 29 Sonam, the other with a mass of 36 sonata, converted into a hundred times a second before they encode.</seg>
<seg id="529">Make these forces before.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">It consists of constant importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO ebnet a completely new way to the investigation of the Alls as they never had previously possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way, we can listen to all the things and listen to the invisible things.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all, we can not see - virtually or fundamentals -- you don't see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why to explores stars in supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned much about the All.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical signs will be happened in the core, which is behind the kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon hidden.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see that this opak are never seen.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitation profiling iron, as if it would be transparent glass. the urine would like to explore the first minutes of the Alls, but we will never see them, since the urine can be covered by its own smashing lights.</seg>
<seg id="541">It should be possible to look back up to the beginning of the gravitation process.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important: I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things that we never have never seen, which we will never have never have any performance. things that we only discover that we are listening to.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO took place in the first start of things that we had not expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague in MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says that: Me are the type of stars, the black holes, as LIGO they are observed, are the Dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, old body from prehistoric times. the black holes are the sauces of the sauces for our archeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO gives us a completely other eye-view angle of the events in All, on the emergence of the stars and finally, as we went out of that chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as easy as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO, we know how to get great detectors, and the noise and circulation of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatory -- a brand new generation of observatories on Earth and the All.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful, than the Urchall itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you. thank You</seg>
<seg id="554">I a experiment with experiment in front of some time.</seg>
<seg id="555">For a year, I would say to all, "Yes," before whom I made me.</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter whether it made me nervous, me in unpleasant situations, I asked me to tell me "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">I wanted to talk to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">I wanted to be live in television?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">I wanted to start playing the play?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly that I do, wovor I feared to fear that my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, to keep my social fear -- Puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">My life has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">Me "yes."</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a particular yes that my life changed my life, on an unexpected art. it started with a question of my young.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the most beautiful, calls out of unexplained reasons.</seg>
<seg id="570">When she was a waitress from the South.</seg>
<seg id="571">"Evaluator, I needed to make milk for my beak."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me to me whether I could play with her playing, when I was just the jump. "and I said," yes "."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from as to fluctuated me, always with them, as soon as you come to me. no matter what I am doing, or when I go, I say to Yes - every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I wasn't perfect, but I beamed me very.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an astonishing outaction: just recently, I am really complete that the "Yes" -Sagen for games with my children delivered my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am the author. I think about things out of winged out the life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Your dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Your dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I Cire TV. I produced a television television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I watch TVs, in large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for this, 70 hours programme into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV channels, 70 hours TV. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every shipment offers hundreds of jobs that have not been existing.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for a episode of a TV channel can vary between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode has four days, four TV channels, four TV channels, four episodes, four episodes, and four episodes: scandal, 15 episodes.: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes of episodes: the Catch, 70 hours Television,</seg>
<seg id="592">$350 million for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series will run on Thursday evening on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">Around the world run my series in 256 languages in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is globally, and 45 this 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have not created, and not only produced, so I have time to tell you time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours TV, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires, which around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Know who still does this?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, so I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Your dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I want to print out my attention. I would like to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think if the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I say to you, so if I say to you, a country or a classroom, a business or a classroom, so I don't understand that I don't know only on the computer or unimaginative, and it's true if I say, I am sure that there are not a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's everything a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, all silence -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work lots, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">If I'm too deepened in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work makes it a land out of the gene.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is, when I put troops on a painting, when I went on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a dream of sound you have a high sound, you'll find a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">How Beyoncé is feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that is at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love it to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, exhausting and conspicuous, funny and maternal, crumbh, and reasonable, cruel and reasonable. and the best of it is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is so a change in me when working well runs.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums of the sums are like an animated road, I could go for ever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take if I have the Summon, that I have overwrite the writing, that writing to me is joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Understand me, don't understand me.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums up -- when I started to work with television production when I started to work and work to create, create, create and work, I discovered this thing this sums.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have a sums, then you can not save differently than the size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling that could not be different when the size is to strive, no matter, at which price.</seg>
<seg id="624">The sums of the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it means also be a workhorse.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps, Genie is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it's Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know it.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I have done for the failure, and I know knows that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I will not want to put it in question.</seg>
<seg id="632">In order to say one more detailed information, ever more interactions, the more recent limits, the more work, the more work gives the more work, the more things more things, the more could me, the more no more than I'm history, the more expectations are there.</seg>
<seg id="633">Ever I work to work in order to be successful, the more needs to work me.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what I said about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country, which I forbid, the marathon which I'm running, the army, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I needed the sums of the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">I am only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then stops the sums.</seg>
<seg id="641">It has revised, overcharged, exaggerated, burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters arrived to the truth that her Mama is a single work Institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my Mama will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerald says: "Schätzing, I would like to go to Shonda Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of an Titles.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums up heard.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine was contested.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work. I didn't love my work.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums came not back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same titles working work, 15 hours-day, no Reuben, no Reue, nothing delegate, there is no evil, don't work with all the heart, clear eyes, as well as always.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me it was quiet.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV channels, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV channels, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously,...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a pre-show Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I didn't have fun more.</seg>
<seg id="661">And this was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums was the sums up and the sums was.</seg>
<seg id="664">What makes you what if you want to do the work, who love you love, suddenly?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know, some sort of memory: "Heul thee, bladder author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you'll need to be a teacher, a painter, who love to be one another, and that is one of the sums, if one knows the sums it, and knows how to make the sums it only, if the sums come back, who is you one thing?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">I am?</seg>
<seg id="669">I still always have a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart beat, I cannot survive in the silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then I will make my "southern states" with a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">I am on the way to the outside, late, and she says: "Mama you play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I already wants to say to me, when I will have two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must said Yes at all, and secondly, they called not called me. "</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls out more "estimation."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is the result?</seg>
<seg id="677">I have passe when I am Titan's and my sums, and this changes everything before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so they said, "Mama you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">Nothing is special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and their sisters, let's say much, and I'm quite dramatic from the book "Everybody Poops" in front of the book "Everybody Poops".</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and in the place of the sums, I can't make anything else to fit apart.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focus.</seg>
<seg id="685">I'm quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country, which I shear, the marathon which I'm running, the army, the screen, the high sound - they exist no longer.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky finger and humid, delicate, wsmalsticker and the song, in which it goes on, or what is the girl in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air on this place is so short that I cannot leave anyone.</seg>
<seg id="690">I cannot believe that I am me.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something is dissolved.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door continues and come in for an energy boost.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that happened immediately, but it happens, it happened.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums is slowly back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volumes, hardly ever, it's quiet, hardly ever, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel that I would know a magic secret as I would know.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay at the thing.</seg>
<seg id="702">It's love. that's everything.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums of sums, the work environment, the Titanpoets, which is only of replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you if you're aware, who I am, if I am me, when I am working with the help of broadcasting and TV hours, and how working my brain then I forgot to do what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no power and it is not working specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is a pleasure depending on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums is depending on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the electricity, which comes from the living conditions.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-awareness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums are ignored the pressure of the story, which is to perform, the anticipation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums is God's voice in my ear, but maybe walled me God the wrong words, because God said to me that I am a Titan's?</seg>
<seg id="715">It's just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I make it a fixed rule, so I can't release me as a workhorse of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law that I have no other choice. I don't have any other choice when I want to hear the Summen again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so simple. I wasn't good in games, I like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Play me not ansatas, as they work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth do is an truth,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't want to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I am staying at the workplace as a pack.</seg>
<seg id="726">This single document is painful, because what a man works better than to be a house?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I am.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly honestly, I get myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too, is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rapid and back in the garden, before and back, and her.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We will sing and play Ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We smashed Seifenbleman in Seifenbleman.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused with me.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always moved to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is O.K.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe must be fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play games and games, I ask myself: why we have heard with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You may also see it! say they always want to play with you when your child want to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you stop me for naiv, for a day job.</seg>
<seg id="742">Since you probably have quite right, but you can also do it!</seg>
<seg id="743">You've got time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child is going to be less interesting, as you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me, and up to them, that they want to make anything else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, I will replace a Marienkäfer or Keks.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speaks my teenage daughter whole 15 minutes with me, I am mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, no need it needs.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can bring 15 minutes a piece, even on a Schlean Laune day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="754">No phone, no lingerie, no debuts.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, your children are ready to finish your children.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in the middle!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my coworase, my world. don't have to be the children. it is not to feel the sums up to have a place for his sailors.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about games with the own children. it goes to joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">For "games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">You can enjoy the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">You will find what you do good.</seg>
<seg id="762">You will find it out and store it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">I am not perfect in it. I'm lucky and I finished victories. friends meet, books, day, --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "you want to play?" "" it's just for everything that I was my first TV show when I was my first TV show when I wanted to exceed me more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 min at the piece, why does not play a full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be it wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my leisure time. the sums seems to return, when I am not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It's time to come into a couple of months, but I find me in my office again. I listen to a unknown melody, they met me and my soul. the sums up the sums up again. I use it in full power and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I love it not.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sums, the sums is not... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Seifenbleman and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of the work is part of me, but only a part. and that I am grateful for this.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is me of me that I am a Titan bin. I never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes at less work and to play more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And nevertheless I have everything in the grip. my brain is still functional. my bonfires still burn.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the lucky, I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">Ever more I play, the more feel I feel a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clear is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better work I am.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more listen to the sums. the country, which I forbid, the marathon which I change the forces, the great sound, the sums, the sums, the sums of the sums, the sums of life: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">Ever more I feel this sums, the more makes this unusual, mighty, bare and new life-experience in me wide. less Titan -- More I!</seg>
<seg id="787">And if I feel exactly this sums, the more knows I am, who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am the author. I think me things from me, I winged out the life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That is part of the job, which means his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">That is the dream of this Jobs,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" said to less work and to play more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titles have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"" "" ""? "" "</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I've got to do every day with human trailers.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a severe stroke rate, or after a autouncase.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon, it is highly fruity that the brain, in contrast to other body organs, has a very low capacity to the self-profit.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of the central nervous system the patients often have a constant, difficult disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I was functional Neurosurgin.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tried to improve the nervous functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly it belongs to one of the most famous, the "deep-cell stimulation," which implanted an electric de deeply in the brain to affect the switching circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improves itself.</seg>
<seg id="805">It's really an amazing technology. it improves the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, which suffered under severe citrus and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">But not Neuro-healing, however, is not Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of neurosurgeon is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">My opinion has to approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close to.</seg>
<seg id="810">With a little help can help himself in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time, I was head of the head office and worked in the noting day.</seg>
<seg id="813">In often, I frequently used patients with Schädel-Hirn-Trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You need to imagine that at Schädel-Hirn-Traumata, brain and cranial pressure decreased.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save the life, you need to reduce the cranial pressure pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">It is necessary to remove a part of swollen brain mass as well.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze us with Jean-François Brunet, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What my I mean?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissues.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no light task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To leave cells from a tissue piece, is comparable to all small children who are out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the correct diet, temperature, moisture, and environments you need to leave it.</seg>
<seg id="823">We had to make it with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts to search it Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly as such as a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Maybe you know from the biologic classes that stem cells are incomplete cells that can transform itself in any cell type of body.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating control: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are unmatched.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were kept differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They spread slowly and after a couple of weeks she died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population which saw as stem cells, but were different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand what they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They stem from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have done it in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">It is 4% of our large-stag cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus, they provide the brain for the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay for us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they will participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher levels close to brain abuses.</seg>
<seg id="847">However, this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is however clear - of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand before a potential cell source, which enables the brain to brain.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass in the non-language area and then the cells exactly as cultured, as it Jean-François did</seg>
<seg id="853">And they were then coloured, in order to follow it in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we implanted it on the basis of the same individual individuals.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist transplantation -- car transplant transplant.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happened when we happen to normal brain tissue in brain tissue? and what will happen when we move the same cells into brain tissue in brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">With the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we observed the cells in a healthy brain and we observed that she would be returned to a few weeks ago, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they will not disappear when they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we added a violation and implanted exactly the same cells and now, the cells were preserved nested out of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see, what we could see under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof that they show, are these small points. these are the cells that we went in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We could not hear of course, of course, of course.</seg>
<seg id="864">The cells also help to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">Therefore, we inherited monkeys with an manual act task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take a feed pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they achieved a stable dexteration level, we were able to handle the motor motex to the motor motex field.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys thought that they were not able to move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it happened in humans, they recovering spontaneously up to a certain extent, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are trained and then try to recover them with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. you are able to recover a certain degree, just like the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the Affe achieved his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left, they see the monkeys, resumed spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It is about 40% to 50% of its original performance before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">See now, when we reimplanted the cells: the same Affe, two months after the maturity.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can say you, that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since this time we have found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can use them and later use them and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease models.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still always interested in people to implanted human beings.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can soon show you how to heal the human brain the means, to heal the human brain.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Spengler: Jocelyne, which is wonderful, I am sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority of memory: "I know someone who need to need."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely have any case.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the largest obstacles are start before you can start clinical studies on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one must fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to fill this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it needs a long time, a lot of patience and a almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: check out in the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. when she continues to look into the future, how many years it takes to come into hospital, and will be available for this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">It initially depends on the approval of clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will allow us to start the authority to start soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you must perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It's just a long time to select the treatments and evaluate the treatments, whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, one must apply to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">One must first really think that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for your visit to Ted and that you told us.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We make in the west make a big mistake, to view it as of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see the democracy is not as the fragile plant, which she is in reality, but as inventory of our company.</seg>
<seg id="904">We neigen to consider it as an unaltered plumage.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitmer in Beijing have proved that it is possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth while the policy remains undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy is in fact that democracy is going to us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece represented -- the new Minister for Finance in the EuroGroup unmistakable that the democratic process of our country has not been able to affect the savings, which were in Greece developed in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">In this moment, I thought that there could be no better support for Lee kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my abundance of friends, which would be repeated that the democracy would be abolished when they would change.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to introduce an economic model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">Please, together with me, to believe that Lee kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the EuroGroup announced a mistake to believe, we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our companies are moving to one, our future nozzles and our great, new technologies.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of disappearance I want to contrary to an interesting contradiction point, that is currently being threatened by our business teams.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "the" twin twin Summit "Paradox" "" "."</seg>
<seg id="916">The summit is known. you know it and recognize it as the Schuldenberg, who comes its long shade over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the Schuldenberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But just a few can recognize its Zones.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of wasted cash, which belongs to those who would have to invest in prison where it would have to carry out and income, with whom we could carry out the debt, and all those things could produce, who need the kind of mankind, for example, "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I suggest them to them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion US Dollars were invested in the United States, in all the prosperity of goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office building, schools, streets, sorrow, equipment, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion dollars sounds after much money, except it compares with the $5,1 trillion US dollars, which were around the same time in the same countries, and that absolutely nothing else, except the stock up and the real estate prices are highly regarded.</seg>
<seg id="923">Such a debt and unproductive capital, the twin twin summit, which are not the same due to the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating, more than a quarter of 25-54-year-old in the United States, Japan and Europe, and therefore will not invest in a final statement that could do not invest. just like Ödipus father, who could be afraid, the prophecy of the Oracite could be true that his son will kill him, when he will grow.</seg>
<seg id="925">Undilated the circumstances which leads to circumstances which lead the furnaces.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my hadern with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely low-product art. All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our life and develop especially all the technologies to finance, "green" technologies that are decisive for the rescue of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is thus democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe already. but before we continue driving: what we understand that we are among democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form, in the open air and arms to control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The athensic Democracy joined many of --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be an error, the importance of the athenical democracy due to this discharge.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision on the athanities of democracy, and it is not only the right to expiration, and it is not only the right to free of opinion, but it is important and crucial to them the right to political cooperation with the same mood in the state of State.</seg>
<seg id="935">The athensic democracy is not held long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which is very bright, it is even burnt out quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our current Secretary-democrats have not have their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the US Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athensic democracy is concentrated on the free citizens and the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the Magna Carta, which was a set of ruling for ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy occurred only when a full separation of policy and economy is possible and the democratic process on the policy, while the economy -- so the world of concert has been a democratical zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present day, since the time of which these separation from politics and economy began, an inconsistent struggle between the two and the economy gradually migrated to the politics by the economy.</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder how the politicians had no longer like earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not possible to degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It lies that one cannot be in the government today, however, not to power, because the power of politics into the economy is emigrated and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hadern with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is in about such as a herd of robatic animals, so the animals, of which they proved to feed them, that they had to be starved at the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that concerns the policy so far. however, the power of the concert is growing, political goods will be deemed to invest political products, the overall economic demand and the Managing Director of the concert are to be anxious to invest in their company in cash.</seg>
<seg id="948">According to capitalism, the "Demos" [the people] came from democracy, the higher the twin gods, and the greater the disappearance of human labour force and the prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If it is true, it is obvious that we must bring the policy and the economy again, and it would be better when the "Demos" will retain, as in the ancient country, apart from the case of slaves, the women and the foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is no new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Linke already had an idea already 100 years ago and it didn't feel good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the Debakel of the Soviet Union was to be that the working poor only should be reincarnation by a miracle, such as in the ancient country, without new species of brutality and disappearance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism are it by making low-grade, and replaced with automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that long economy and politics are separated, the automation process can be lower than the twin gods, the disappearance, and the social conflicts, as it is - already very soon as I think in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So, we have to unite the economy and the areas of economy and politics again, and to ensure that, in an anti-hyper Hypercrative, the film "Matrix" like a documentation is released.</seg>
<seg id="957">So, the question is not whether the capitalism has brought the technical achievements, which he has brought to survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more detailed question is whether the capitalism is similar to "Star Trek," similar to those who go to the universe in "Star Trek," in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long talks with the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we might be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So, what does it look like it could look like this "Star Trek" -like utopia rather than the "Matrix" -like Dystroscopy?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to tell you shortly, some examples include.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of companies: please make a capital market before you find money in which you'll find money in the next post, by a company to the next, and the company - no matter what you've just works - is the property which currently works in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and redeem the concept of the wage work is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction from which the company belong to work, but the company does not work, and employees who are not part of the company there. no debit more between capital and work, no major gaps between investment and savings, and finally does not affect the twin twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economics: make sure that our national currencies had a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global digital currency, which will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group] of 20 biggest emerging markets], issued in interest of all mankind.</seg>
<seg id="966">Make sure that the whole world trade will be traded in this currency, we call them "Kosmos" in units from "Kosmos" -- and every government pays a sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or trading income of the respective country, into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in "green" technologies, particularly in parts of the world, in which the fields of investment are.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is no new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes was suggested by John Maynard Keynes in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time, the technical means I did not implement the technical means.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have found it in particular against the background of a re-compatible Policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I give you the enemy, in which they are preferred persons, and marxing, because they were buried in the trashcan of history and work in the trashcan of history, and keynesize, globally keynesize.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all other, it is a world, where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We are waking in such a world.</seg>
<seg id="975">Or are we decrease in a "Matrix" - similar Dystroscopy?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to decide together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you. thank You</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You get your biography in your biography itself as liberté Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">Today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varouviis: if any of what I have just said, Marx will be relevant to Marx.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and business is... Tun we do not know that the technological development will produce a massive decline in the overall economic demand, making Larry Summers as "long term Stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis in a part of the earth to the next, as we see it currently, it will not only be our democratic destabilize, but also the countries whose interest to liberaler democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is, Marx's relevant, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, so I have a liberate Marxist, and like keynes, and therefore I'm completely inswirl.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are probably also available.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if one is not confused, if you don't know enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein that said. BG: in your lecture mentioned in Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Redner you have very clear, what you keep from the point of view to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Do you want to repeat this here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a large size of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberals democrats we have the attack of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited the democracy to the policy, while the area where most of the business, -- the area of the economy -- a completely democratically elected zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In certain respect, when I say the so-called proocative, China is similar to China today of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- -- let's remember to combine liberalism with democracy -- this is an error, historically important.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially skeptically, which affects the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What are now possible in China, resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now illegal to do what the West in the 19th century itself, rieve raped to Heuchelei.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners was curious about your experiences as the finance ministers of Greece in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I found that the coming comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of 2015?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal viewpoint, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro area.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the euro area,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, by the deduction of that, and the digestible appeal is that a massive reduction in the Eurozone through the Eurozone, and continue to reduce the development of the entire European Union massively.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity to date, on the basis of the Greek front - the way, the first suggestion was supposed to pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="1008">It's right to make. unfortunately the powers of the euro area, within the European group, will continue to vote.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tried to obtain a economic system that is not covered, by political will and art guitar at the life, you may have a while, but if the change occurs, he happened and destroyable.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change you see?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there's no doubt that the euro zone does not have any future when we change it.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: haven't made any error in your time as a financial officer?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who look back -- Ernest...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister for Finance, or any minister, after 6 months in the office, especially in a so-called situation, he claims no error, then that is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest error was to grant the application for the extension of the school program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was a honest interest in the money to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that there was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They wanted to walk only our government, only because they wanted to deal with the gradations that ran through the euro zone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">She wanted to be noted that she has led a catastrophihalf programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Because the "Great Depression" is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the Troika of the monetary policy which has imposed us this policy: "this was a colossaler error."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all the effects, despite the aggressive Tons of talks, you seem to be quite right per-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone, compared to Yemen, who lives and loves love.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the euro zone does not survived.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they did not survive, the acquitted flicker forces are destroy and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not operate alone for Europe catastrophic consequences, but for the whole world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the most powerful economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we want to beat the way of a postmodern 1930, which it appears to be it, it will be as far as to the future of Europeans like the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, many thanks, that you were at Ted.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Most of the Roy Price will never have never been part, although it is probably responsible for 22-sized minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision to hit the Roy before three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior executive of Amazon Studios.</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">It is 47 years old, slim, has an icon and describes on Twitter as "films, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for this shows, shows the shows and the content to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard around in the industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy do not select any extra TV series.</seg>
<seg id="1047">It must find shows that are very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, it must find shows that you can find the right at this bend.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows of this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Your show is rewarded with nine and higher, this one is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows such as "Breaking Bad," The Wire "-- all the shows that make it one season, your brain asks:" where there are more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This type of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left side, here at this end, shows such as "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- which should tell you enough that goes on this track at the end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not hesitate to get to the left side of the curve, because I don't need a special intelligence to undergoing "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts on the mean follow-up, the average TV - the shows that neither well bad are not bad, they were not yet easy.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is also the first time that Amazon makes it something like a bit.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs a guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He performs many ideas for TV shows and select an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and features online where they can look at any charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if needed, otherwise, there is certain things that you are right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">In addition, these episodes can spread over this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, it does not know that they are observed during tightening of these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team, which will absorb everything from Roy and his team.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture how to start the show when you get paused, what parts of it out or once again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">In order to collect millions of data to decide with these data then the show you have to produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">Indeed, they collect these data, process, and this is the answer, and this is the answer: "Amazon was to make a SitCom about four Republican US transmitters."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Knows the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "alpha House" but it seems that there is no many of these show because they did not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is just an average show -- in the truest sense of the Word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House lano at 7.5 -- so something about the average, but not just that of which Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time at another company, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programme design of Netflix. just like Roy has always be found on the search for this one Super show, but he also uses data for it, but it makes it slightly different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of a competition, he and his team have committed the existing data on the Netflix spectators, so the reviews, they give them the shows, their course, which shows you like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then use this data to find these small details about the audience: what shows they like, what producers, what actor.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they took a car to have a car and decided to make a SitCom via four mustators, but a drama Series over a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix has one hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"House of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly there, where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course is the question: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very comittive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">You connect this many data and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is what?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic should be somehow states that that it should work with all.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collects millions of data, for a decision to turn it, then you should make a good decision to make the right choice.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as a Back-Up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It has been optimized with very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The Mindeste, what you can expect, is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work so if data analysis does not work, because we live in a time, in which we live more and more to statistics to meet serious decisions, far beyond the television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Knows how this is the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that is even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes in touch with this software. come in contact with this software, you are in contact with this software.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone asks here in the United States in jail and to unrelease, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a mission is performed or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just as with Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad, it will be decided whether a person is good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Central television, 22 minutes, which may be a bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately there is evidence of evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results were created. this does not remember that a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data can be reversible-in companies.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes sometimes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it was predictions by data analysis, the racial of flu, predictions can say - by data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It was wonderful and was a great news reports. the success is in a release in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It works fine, year around year, until it suddenly didn't work yet,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the reunification of the release in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data can be experienced companies like Amazon and Google have sometimes something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these mistakes the data presented data into the decisions of life a -- on the My Computer on law, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should prefer to ensure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I know many difficulties with data. I work on the computer-assisted genetics -- a territory where some very smart people do not make many data to meet serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer-therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I detected some pattern about the difference between the successful decisions on the basis of data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Need to solve a complex problem, do you see mainly two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">When creating this problem in its individual parts, so you can analyze the individual parts; as second, you set the individual parts again to summarize a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes, you have to do this times, but there are always two things: apart and again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help you change the problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to add the parts back in time and then to come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">For this there is another tool and we own all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that the brain is good, it's parts and plays together, even if the information is not complete, but if the information is not completely to summarize - especially if the brain is one of experts.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they have used data and delay, where it also belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use the data to understand their audience better. but the decision how to take all these parts, go back and put an show like the House of Cards, which is not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they went into a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">To Amazon, on the other hand, however, this is the false way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They useless data to control all their decisions, first as they chose TV-ideas wetted, then as they voted "Alpha House" as show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision to say because they could always say, "says the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It didn't want to get a desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things are wrong when data will start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how machtfully they are, data is only a tool used, and in order to forget that this device is pretty useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before it gave data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball". it is amazing. for decisions using a Jing or Nein-question you have to shake the ball to get a answer. "most likely" -- exactly here in this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'll be a real estate later with a technology demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So I've met some decisions in my life, and I would have to listen to the ball on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">However, as you know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace these data by a little bit sophisticated, as data analysis, to meet better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic design.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball well as well as well as well as well as well. finally, it lies to meet decisions that you want to reach the right at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I want to take this as a very encouraging message that, despite the great amount of data is still paid, decisions expected to be an expert in which what you do, and risk to go.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end, it is not the data but the risks, with which you encounter at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you nice.</seg>
