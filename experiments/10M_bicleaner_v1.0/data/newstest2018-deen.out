Munich 1856 : four cards you change your views to the city .
today , a ir@@ re @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where people encounter a young people today .
a Gru@@ ft@@ y , where now stands for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
Klein@@ g@@ är@@ tner proved the former cause of farmers in the same time .
the oldest official map of Munich delivers exciting stories about days .
there are nervous , if land maps are not currently .
that knows everyone who had to wait in time because the car @-@ Nav@@ i took place a green me@@ adow .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als of Bavaria , are all other as currently - yet very easy @-@ to @-@ run .
in particular if you compare them to current online cards using current online cards .
then the cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ ak , which one can not be found as such as such .
the great overview map were collected for cities and municipalities in detail for more detailed cards , so @-@ called Ur@@ als .
this was created according to the Bavarian State Administration between 1810 and 1864 , and jump on the first size of Bay@@ erns Bay@@ er@@ ania .
their client : Napoleon .
the French military leader , Bavaria since spring 1800 joined the Second Coalition War with Austria in the spring of 1800 .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the last country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bay@@ erns for military purposes .
even though the French troops were moved with peace from Lun@@ é@@ ville of 9 February 1801 , the present neigh@@ bors who created the idea of an extensive Bayern @-@ map .
El@@ ector Max IV. continued to launch the project , the &quot; Top@@ ograph@@ ische Bureau &quot; set up the &quot; Top@@ ograph@@ ische Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Meas@@ ures Administration .
the German opposition Journal of Munich comes from 1856 to find as all other on the site of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of early / Heu@@ te is the example of the state capital on an impressive .
the city has grown into all directions and has grown in all directions .
one example of this is sub@@ s@@ end@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
S@@ end@@ ling became a 21 years after creating the map , in 1877 , when Munich &apos;s district .
today , Unter@@ s@@ end@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses are made in 1856 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian capital against Austria 17@@ 05 .
where today &apos;s western park , you &apos;ll see nothing as a fields - at the first glance , a small piece map with d@@ utz@@ ing lines and numbers : handwritten notes from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ photograph , &quot; which is derived from the basic tax .
small plots put here today no farmers in the sun as well as Klein@@ g@@ är@@ tner of the plant &quot; Land in sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ s@@ end@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 of the Oktober@@ fest , was in the 19th century still a me@@ adow and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical card gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the Ur@@ position , one can not only reads the street name &quot; by the Au Hai@@ d@@ hausen near the road &quot; or from the view &quot; on the sk@@ ies , &quot; but also in large letters &quot; ear@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse in the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse near to the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse , once more people with guards .
there was 1858 / 59 the Munich district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ s &apos; was created on the Au@@ er lies .
from 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the establishment of a psychiat@@ rist , who brought to King Louis II in connection with the death of King Louis II .
for his time , he was progressive for his time and ended , for example the Ank@@ ets of the so @-@ called ear@@ thly .
in addition , he tells the personnel down , violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with An@@ st@@ alt .
only 280 patients were first place , later it was increased to 500 places later .
sometime , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the district administration in hair in 1905 .
there since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s biggest psychiat@@ ry in Germany .
at the area of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , adol@@ esc@@ ents in Munich Sal@@ esians at the site of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt .
the Order obtained the building complex in 1920 and turned him to a youth home with vocational training .
west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich east , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
built in 2015 , the children &apos;s home &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; - was destroyed in the direction of the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , who was destroyed during the Second World War during the Second World War .
the Marien@@ platz was listed in 1856 as &quot; main square , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies cra@@ bs in December of 1944 many holes in the city centre .
until today - at the Mari@@ enhof Stu@@ d .

the old Munich @-@ card can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view at today - and the hole at the Mari@@ enhof Stu@@ d .
Civil Code released by means of Mis@@ souri
the National Association for promoting colour of colour has issued a warning for coloured people which are on the discre@@ ri@@ min@@ ant politics and the ra@@ cial attacks of the state after Mis@@ souri .
the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory is said to take into force by August 28 , 2017 , is requ@@ est@@ ing to en@@ dur@@ e American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ aner , as a number of frag@@ mentation , r@@ ust @-@ based stocks , which occur here in the whole state , is said to be noted in the opinion of the group .
the recently adopted law of Mis@@ souri , which makes it serious and discri@@ min@@ ating authorities as well as the criminal authorities of the state that were in@@ stituted on min@@ orities of min@@ orities , promp@@ ted the group , the search warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said that NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; you will happen to injuries of the civil rights , people will happen .
they are addressed because of their skin colors , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kan@@ sas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency which we did not have heard . &quot;
it is the first such warning that has been exhibited for a state in the United States .
the Group cited as ra@@ cial understanding with black students at the University of Mis@@ souri , and death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ differently died under frag@@ mented circumstances in the beginning of the year after he had no longer than gasoline more , and by the police of Mis@@ souri , in custody , without a crime .
the Council also indicates a report of the offices of the general state @-@ owned by Mis@@ souri , in which the black driver will be more common in the state of 75 percent more common than the White .
the Recommen@@ dation is that people are consci@@ ously , and their families , friends and employees have to inform about what could happen in Mis@@ souri . &quot;
&quot; the people must be ready to bring whether it will bring to Kau@@ b or the relatives , that they are traveling through the state . &quot;
Mis@@ souri was able to break 100 % in 2015 , after the latest figures from the Hass@@ ver@@ bre@@ athe report program of the F@@ BI , set up the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also a response to a new Mis@@ souri law which would be difficult to make a company because of living or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) was issued by the states of Texas and Arizona , had adopted the local criminal authorities to commit people because of immigration cases , which is to contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U to the other rati@@ fication .
travel war@@ nings will rule be issued by the Ministry of Economic Affairs for other countries , but in the last time , groups of interest in response to certain laws and trends are used within the United States .
elementary project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year .
the CDU Bundestag Parliament , Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac took place a picture on site .
the representative of the Schwen@@ demann family members from the fishing village of Schwen@@ demann met for the mayor of Thomas Schneider and the two races .
Markus Schwen@@ demann granted his insights into its operation , in which it houses 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows , as well as many young animals and in five apartments are accommod@@ ates .
the &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ ald milch , &quot; is the alternative way for an alternative focus on the milk of his cows , as Schwen@@ demann .
at the table of the Resorts is exclusively Regional .
since he is also called the BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fish@@ bach , it is important as elementary project as a &quot; elementary project . &quot;
I can not play any steep surfaces in such parts .
the green area for much work , much that is working with the motor sense .
we have shown here with the conditions and to fight with the Top@@ ography &quot; stressed Schwen@@ demann .
in 2003 , he had taken over the el@@ eventh operation and put into account for this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zers , even if he does not guide it .
for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the commune has recognized the significance of the crossover project , and is delighted with the leader . &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , the farmers would have to be supported .
it is hope that the request of the areas could still be pushed for a whole time .
we have the greatest treasure that we have people who work in agriculture work , and thoughts about how they continue to bring their operations . &quot; says the mayor &apos;s mayor .
the farmers are often often found in criticism
over the crossover networks have been fenced in 2013 , a total of 25 participants were fenced .
the primary open area is about 40 hectares , which may not be used by at least 20@@ 23 .
the total cost of 71 500 euros was funded by the leader , a quarter to the Municipality of Fish@@ bach .
so the farmers were able to invest 12 610 euros , which had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of consec@@ u@@ ckle .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; declared Schwen@@ demann .
K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you really does a really good job , without farmers and landing . &quot;
even for Peter White stood there : &quot; here best food has been produced here . &quot;
the Land@@ sc@@ rub@@ bing line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state promotion of Wei@@ de@@ oc@@ ene .
the destination is the open source of the Black Forest .
the presence is a subject matter by the L@@ PR recorded conveyor .
moreover , the non @-@ smo@@ ked area cannot be tow@@ ed ( at 35 per cent ) and must be threatened by our request .
for the Fish@@ bacher @-@ 2018 Fish@@ eries project , the request of eight participants currently runs at 24 plots , which would like to build nearly 16 kilometers of fence .
the primary open area corresponds to 35 hectares , the cal@@ ming costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp can now be created by the White House of Tru@@ mp .
the transparent first signs of a regime exchange is it when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans estimate that just like any other - therefore the sor@@ row was staged by the fall of Saddam Hussein &apos;s Fir@@ m in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key idea of the Tru@@ mp regim@@ es , knew what he did , when he did a symbolic court with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CNN about the suggestions of the president to dras@@ tic limitation of the leg@@ al@@ thy emigr@@ ation with the freedom of liberty .
in order to remain fair , Miller ( not the statue ) .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators have had in@@ feed it , if he had done .
but he handle its meaning , and especially the importance of which it was considered to be the famous po@@ em of Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after completion of the thinking , was added again .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta g@@ im@@ min@@ ated : &quot; I will not go to a complete di@@ ing over history , but the freedom of the statue is ... a symbol of American freedom , which en@@ cap@@ tures the world .
the po@@ em , on which you can refer to which later , was added later , and not part of the original language is known . &quot;
Miller is amazing right , but as it is formulated , it &apos;s not really a story .
it &apos;s about the performance of Laz@@ arus , which invites the only one , in which a state not only charges any old immigrants , but the sleeves of the poor , &quot; your poor , your poor , / your be@@ mo@@ ur@@ ged masses which are looking for at@@ men , / the attack@@ ing of thy waters . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ ende waste &quot; was better to see better on our screen .
Miller committed itself in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome to Tru@@ mps USA .
this conflict due to the importance of a statue , part of a wider political and cultural confron@@ tation : it is indeed a conflict in fact the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and their friends who refused to place their words after her death on the basis of the basis , had very good that she has completed a high political party .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American @-@ American Repub@@ lic@@ ism by adding them in one of the most popular classical representation of the female Co@@ ör@@ per@@ ation of freedom .
Laz@@ arus changed this importance : in its po@@ em , the female figure is not more abstract - it has received a voice .
and she herself is a very other name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the Ge@@ di@@ ke with the picture is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just like Laz@@ arus , the importance of the statue changed , the people wanted to return from right wing .
the big write h@@ als Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argu@@ ed that the Statue of being in@@ filtr@@ ing , rather rather a early neo @-@ con@@ doms existed in which the American flame burned down in the world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues .
it is alleged to bear the F@@ ack@@ el the Freedom of the United States in the rest of the world .
the f@@ ack@@ el should not be the way to the United States . &quot;
quite unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh stayed here on a little bit .
the importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of the perception .
the great ph@@ ant@@ asi@@ evol@@ le indeed of Laz@@ arus was , as they see , as they had seen from the exhaus@@ tible , but hop@@ ed full people after long and often terrible travel on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the true sense of how to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge , and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of the hope and of the welcome , which they must listen .
and this is of course not the perspective , the Miller and Tru@@ mp can be seen .
their f@@ ack@@ el should not have the way to light , but the hatred , who is the only source of power , ign@@ ited the power .
world championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black with Scottish members of the United Kingdom
Ei@@ li@@ ie Do@@ yle is reminiscent of a time when just two car@@ rots for the team of Great Britain .
the performance director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom &apos;s Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent at the world championship will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland has developed something special &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom to learn something .
we welcome you to understand , and we try to understand , and we will run it , until we &apos;ll need to figure out what kind . &quot;
&quot; I speak with people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they did .
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they did .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the type on the street corner .
what is always the combination of circumstances is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athlete are medals candidates , amongst them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ cher - who can compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while Ei@@ li@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected to the team .
&quot; Ei@@ li@@ ie is pretty modest .
their chapter was incredible , &quot; says Black .
a number of athletes , no matter whether they were Scottish , or where they are still living or train , went out of the room and felt very motiv@@ ating .
the passion and the genuine feeling , the o@@ li@@ dh made of course , was great . &quot;
the Commonwealth Silver me@@ da@@ illons winner , who is going to compete in the fifth world championships in the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dle , says that it is unbeliev@@ ably , that 16 Sh@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland has so far been the best number of athletes at the World Championship in 1983 , which was reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the Middle Ages Mu@@ ir route leads on this road and has five British and two European records in the past year .
it will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m floor .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another piece that is one of the great season to observe the victory at the British team Tri@@ as and the Anniversary Games , watch .
Do@@ yle is reminiscent of her first World Cup , when the only other Sch@@ otte was Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the Mann@@ ery capit@@ als said that they are very proud &quot; that many of their fellow country@@ men are not only among the team , but in some cases also in the medals and at the Fin@@ als .
to be the special team of this team , that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that my team mate was voted for me , and have chosen me to become something special for me , &quot; added to them . &quot;
I obviously very proud to all the sh@@ ots , which are part of the team .
it shows just how far we come , as far we come .
and they are here a established athlete , athletes , who want to climb on Po@@ dies .
what my speech delivered as an capit@@ als ?
yes , I think they went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , since we have a home world championship .
it &apos;s really important to set this home support and take advantage of that we are back in the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go there , and to compete , it &apos;s just as a great atmosphere as outside . &quot;
block of critics on Facebook : Be@@ z@@ b are not to be a public office if you don &apos;t wear the he@@ aters of vot@@ ers .
the father of our country , knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it took not long until the newspapers brought him for themselves because of the interior policy up to his political principles .
he im@@ migr@@ ated to criticism , safe .
but he has not brought his critic .
as in the year 1783 , Washington said : &quot; the Rede@@ mption of freedom can be taken away - and , du@@ mm@@ ed and un@@ read@@ ed , we will have led to the sheep . &quot;
this brings me to Governor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work on me to be more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ an employee have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people , which have sold their opinion on his official Facebook page .
in the beginning of this week , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union agree him so that this week .
the staff of the Govern@@ ments left the law@@ suit against Fr@@ vol . , and the online commentary was full of a counter@@ act with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when it is like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhel@@ ming democratic state that is amazing popular .
he has the second highest approval of the nation &apos;s 50 govern@@ ors .
H@@ og@@ an is no re@@ ac@@ tionary heat head .
he has a fixed hand in the leadership of its state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect Facebook to his vot@@ ers , and have his ha@@ ar@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the block@@ age of people who come on the side of the Govern@@ ments - which is officially referred to as officially as officially referred to and by employees that are paid by public tax @-@ dollar - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post defended H@@ og@@ ans speaking to Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse , the actions of the govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that the comments of the comments are nothing more than a pres@@ ation .
but it &apos;s easy to use the image of troll@@ s or split @-@ filled people , which are online the P@@ eit@@ s .
the post spoke with some of the actual people who had blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and that are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they said all the comments that their comments were full , re@@ conc@@ ise and not to work .
the parish of the parish is the Bible in his post and app@@ el@@ ated of H@@ og@@ ans Catholic faith .
attor@@ ney Lak@@ sh@@ mi ra@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not h@@ ass@@ as , but she asked him to break .
I commented the pol@@ ite , I dis@@ appointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current messages , &quot; wrote in the commentary range of the news release &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not even if a number of people go to the same position , then they will be recognized by some more than a so called collective risk of citizens and not considered a major group of citizens . &quot;
what employees of the Govern@@ ments as &quot; concentrated sp@@ am attack &quot; would call others would be &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; . &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut to a message by simply a critic or a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times , if one would have been the same that employees were sand@@ ed to collect newspapers with the critical goods , and to burn or demonstr@@ ators .
but this happens just digitally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials that cri@@ tici@@ zed by Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp will be accused of Twitter users suffering from Twitter , which were blocked by his Twitter Fe@@ ed .
one of the first mile@@ stones in one of the first mile@@ stones in Virginia .
the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County , the last First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , called by a vot@@ ers from their Facebook page .
in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt . ( R ) was also obtained a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
that should not be difficult .
at the time Washington &apos;s time , the time of an affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers are promising between 1776 and 1800 , and an anonymous letter proposed to his lead .
and even at that time , anonymous , anonymous , was anonymous .
people who have pseu@@ don@@ y@@ me like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ cio &quot; used , wrote all letters of newspapers , Washington &apos;s decisions .
Peti@@ te , who cri@@ tici@@ zed its point of view over the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and the shipping industry for the United Kingdom , according to the historic documents , collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project .
but he has not brought them to the tail .
speech , opinion of opinion , and dis@@ courses are among the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means that we accept .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes to domestic comfort in Renaissance club
the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope the next three days in the next three days since the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an gives the 25th edition of the Scottish senior Open .

&quot; I haven &apos;t able to defend the Extre@@ madura Open , as they had won , after I won them out of the program .
back to this part of the world is magic .
it is a wonderful place for golf .
the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we always appreciate all . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday , returns to the promotion .
this event will be his first Scottish appearance at the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish open in 2013 .
&quot; it means always a bit more if you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you feel good , but you also need this additional pressure .
I really enjoyed it again , and I played a solid golf .
I am glad like that time , I am glad . &quot;
with the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Champion Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark McN@@ ist .

less pul@@ mon@@ ds s@@ aut@@ um@@ ote by passive smoke
in the past two decades , less people died for passive working days in lung cancer .
scientists from the University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) will come into a study .
according to our estimates , € 167 lung cancer was due to passive protein , &quot; said the Hei@@ ko Becher .
as a result , he moved to this topic at the subject of 1994 .
at that time , there was still 400 lung cancers which was given for passive working per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; published .
house ports are considered very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; lie within the time , &quot; thus the head of the station Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of household connections , the situation existed in more than expected , because in the underground , there is much qui@@ berge , which should not be noted in the plans .
the traffic , which always under@@ stands the construction work , represents a large problem for the construction of the company Stum@@ pp .
&quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ ms of the driver in front of red amp@@ les and tra@@ ff@@ r@@ g@@ ings is already enormously &quot; , &quot; Hein@@ ze .
the road is locked away and then entitled to the bus station to drive the road .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ dar@@ z and Tim Ko@@ de@@ z by the company Stum@@ pp has been working with the works at the bridge for weeks .
&quot; the hot days were already quite stren@@ uous . &quot;
but fortunately , we were powered by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; tells Mar@@ vin Ko@@ de@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i is cooked , dinner does not use a stove .
it even uses a sau@@ cep@@ an pot .
in her wood house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the P@@ ani@@ ai province in the un@@ quiet Indon@@ esian province of Papua New , the house@@ wife is usually called a confection@@ ery - locally as &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the Kn@@ olle will be taken with ei@@ fri@@ es , unc@@ ach@@ able hands and closures .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the Leh@@ m@@ ole - it has no furniture - where they also leads your daily work , such as clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp to wash them .
a bu@@ cket in a homeless room is used as Lat@@ rine .
as youngest of the four wives of their husband , her husband were not assigned to no fields .
poly@@ g@@ amie is common here .
of course , it can be potentially dangerous : most of the village men are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers .
no one passed away in the village around 17 o &apos;clock in the village . &quot; she says . &quot;
it is more rarely gli@@ mp@@ se into the daily life in the high@@ land of Papua New Guinea , a former Dutch colony , which came in Indonesia to a controversial referendum , just 1,0@@ 26 El@@ ders are caused by a public h@@ ander@@ ing against the occupying troops .
an existing movement that ruled for independence against the Dutch reign , turned rapidly to the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control over the region and foreign journalists or legal issues .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided in Papua New Guinea , and the independent part of Papua New Guinea &apos;s eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is thus far off as it is . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a moral 5 @-@ hour drive away by car rental .
there are no public transport links .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made of wood floors that are surrounded by bam@@ boo @-@ lag@@ o@@ ons , and of corrugated roofs , which have been transformed into various sal@@ b@@ brown sounds .
just a few Indon@@ esians have made their journey here , singing for journalists and practically any foreig@@ ner .
before Christian mission@@ aries , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans had a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
we were not cur@@ able to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and suggests to their lively , handy @-@ woven Tur@@ ban , its dark@@ er shirt and their bright rock .
&quot; earlier we had only cover leaves to our body @-@ n . &quot;
Papua is Indon@@ esians in the po@@ o@@ rest province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s ster@@ b@@ ation and alpha@@ be@@ ti@@ zing rates in Asia .
but it is also Indon@@ esians at gold .
the largest and most profitable gold mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from P@@ ani@@ ai , a high@@ land province of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has destroyed gold and copper in the value of 3.1 billion .
in addition , Papua New resources has wooden resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
however , this wealth , however , are a source of mis@@ ery for Papua Papua New Guinea , ensuring that Indon@@ esians at the military domin@@ ate a sti@@ cking presence .
a study conducted in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local military factory and units from 1998 to 2004 reached nearly 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to one single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ sian demands according to larger aut@@ onomy threatened this golden g@@ ans and are treated .
according to the activists , more than 500,000 Papua New Guinea have been killed and thousands of thousands were ra@@ ped and imprisoned in 1969 by the Indon@@ esian military .
massacres of the Pap@@ u@@ as stem in Pap@@ u@@ as stem in the 1970 @-@ 10 years , according to the Asia @-@ human rights commission .
in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful protest@@ ers in the region alone .
the fact that , in a report of the Arch@@ diocese of Brisbane , from 2016 , in which reports on the atro@@ cities of the previous year are concerned , such as un@@ legal exec@@ utions and torture and electrical events are particularly popular after another report - and the violent decline of peaceful demonstrations .
it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researchers for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have reinforced , since Pap@@ u@@ as Resources bring to an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indon@@ esians .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is about 83 % Christian , but the demographic development changed , since Muslim economic immigrants from the be@@ eke@@ eping islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .

in 2014 , the Indon@@ esian president J@@ ok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in Volk@@ sm@@ ist and as J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i , spoke out during his campaign of campaign in 2014 the im@@ pregn@@ ation and the rights violations in Papua New Guinea .
the former Zimmermann dies 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including P@@ ani@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua Papua New Guinea has little changed , and today the locals would make the locals .
our hearts are broken because we will need for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i , with the anticip@@ ation that he will meet our hopes , &quot; says you . &quot;
in fact , P@@ ani@@ ai suffered only two months after J@@ ok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October a low@@ point .
on 7 December 2014 a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas members before a bon@@ fires in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle through the darkness .
the fri@@ d children told them to them that they are switch to their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers started their sound and came back with four soldiers , so the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had dr@@ unk , hunting , and they slew the group with their children of men , saying , and Wit@@ nesses .
then , one of the soldiers held in the group of children .
a child , who had the 16 year old Y@@ er@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was heavily beaten so that he fell into the Com@@ a .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things to escal@@ ate the next day .
approximately 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Tribunal for Justice .
they fought against the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - in circle and a bird @-@ singing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started up stones on police and military spending .
when the mo@@ ck was heated up , the soldiers were sent over an internal radio : &quot; if the crowds has more than three times , &quot; shoot them dead &quot; in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not approved in the local media .
Y@@ er@@ emi@@ as Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ quad@@ ru@@ by En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , looked after peace and called for peace and called the quantity of his time to return home .
no one was to listen to the mood .
when I turned off , I suddenly shot in my lin@@ kes wrist , he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his b@@ unt @-@ painted wooden house .
Kay@@ ame knows still not , who has been fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the here gathered soldiers .
it was over@@ crow@@ ded , many shots have been fired . &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin were the witness to the shooting .
I tried to him , and tested his body to ensure that it was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ane , who bears as many Indon@@ esians , who carries a name to the TI@@ ME in nozzle .
I saw that he was dead ... I have broken him . &quot;
the Che@@ fin@@ eness of Papua New @-@ police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said re@@ por@@ ters that his officers wanted to secure their station &quot; back , &quot; they wanted to be attacked .
&quot; we have to defend when people threatened to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others .
the news about the kill@@ ings only came to Jak@@ arta in the following day .
three weeks , J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i kept an passionate address in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura for the families of the victims of the victims of the victims and pregnant in Papua New Guinea .
&quot; I want to happen that this case is immediately solved , so it will not happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he was a extra@@ judicial mechanism for the establishment of historical human rights ab@@ uses .
but the talk started in almost immediately .
most of the injuries are in front of long time .
some were in the 90 @-@ year @-@ old years and at the beginning of the 2000 years .
the point is that we are obliged to go these assemblies , but there are processes that have to pass through &quot; he said . &quot;
then , Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke with TI@@ ME , in Jak@@ arta with TI@@ ME , and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Papua New Guinea .
instead , it is regulated by law , he said .
Wir@@ anto , which was indicted for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; which had demanded more than 1.000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody vote of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses were already laid down in Papua New Zealand , including the P@@ ani@@ ai signs .
families of p@@ ani@@ ai victims took place such alleg@@ ations with fi@@ er@@ ical in@@ flow .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ ane .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear still in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid that was arrested by the military , said to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in P@@ ani@@ ai was afraid of the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military , after he helped him to go four of the victims of the victims .
after I buried the dead , I sought the military to me , &quot; he says .
the sliding doors must not be heard .
on Tuesday , the Indon@@ esian police arrested in P@@ ani@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confron@@ tation between the village and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a conscious men into hospital , died a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned , when he conf@@ is@@ cated from the nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
disman@@ tling of the company in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers of the vill@@ agers from officers were raised by the re@@ su@@ mption of the women &apos;s warning .
but one may tell that the mobile Brigade ( in@@ don@@ ese par@@ amilit@@ ary police ) began to shoot and killed a dead@@ ly .
we were so in p@@ anic , we have fear that there are Ra@@ che , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i who had been living in the proximity of the hospital , and witnessed how the last here is to be delivered , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; myself two days in my house . &quot;
D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called to draw the officers for the control and to withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police in the field .
P@@ ani@@ ai was always a in@@ ru@@ ding producer for the in@@ don@@ ese government .
the lack of sen@@ su@@ ous development is strengthening the diss@@ atis@@ faction of the tri@@ bal of the tri@@ bal , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ land of Papua New Guinea .
many formed the &quot; Free Papua Movement , &quot; ( OP@@ M ) , the rebel group , claims to defend the rights of Papua New Zealand , to defend the rights ab@@ adi@@ c attacks , attacks by Indon@@ esian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ OP@@ M leader come from P@@ ani@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to thousands of people in P@@ ani@@ ai , thousands of people were arrested and arbitr@@ ary in custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing the national sovereig@@ nty . &quot;
some dive back again .
among the people in Papua New P@@ anic , P@@ ani@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic and tra@@ cked place . &quot;
poverty is strengthening the diss@@ atis@@ faction .
the bit rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is to be expensive for locals .
bread is the same as operating range .
the people are build here everything that they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ lets .
agriculture is the task of women who work in each four or five fields of the confection@@ ery .
you will keep the majority of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces Not@@ a cost only 10,000 asp@@ don@@ ese Ru@@ pi@@ en ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
during the time , economic im@@ pe@@ ers grew between the native Papua New and the new Mig@@ ran@@ ts , which has arrived since the opening of new flight gro@@ oves for the airport umbi@@ li@@ ire in larger number .
the few work stations , which are in the region , are usually trained to the better and we@@ ather@@ ing their migrant .
Papua Papua Papua New Guinea , rarely , or the necessary skills to lead their own company competitive competitive .
the young people are not interested in the village to stay in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Go@@ bay , chairman of the main Council of P@@ ani@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world of Papua New Zealand .
in addition , restrictions on the reporting of international media are ten@@ sed .
at the beginning of the year , French journalist Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp have been deported to the lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua New Zealand , although they gave them rare permission to films .
according to P@@ hel@@ per K@@ ine , the Deputy Head of Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the accus@@ ations carried out by J@@ ok@@ ow@@ is sel@@ ections to raise the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development .
there are new risks for foreign journalists who try to report from Indon@@ esians in the calm provinces of Papua and West@@ pap@@ ua , try to report : visa delay and a black list , &quot; he said in a statement .
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the in@@ don@@ ese government largely remains largely to the immediate neighbours Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , the six p@@ hat states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ ons Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and far more widespread injuries &quot; in Papua including the P@@ anic .
the same countries have seen the OP@@ M .
the spokes@@ man for the Indon@@ esian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to sei@@ zing the evidence for human rights . &quot;
people want to know that more foreign governments take care of the knowledge .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , visited K@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , the silence of her silence and ur@@ ged him &quot; We want to &quot; freedom &quot; according to a source which also participated in the session .
Indonesia has a further presidential election , but the Papua say that they probably do not have to vote for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i .
J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good prospects , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the P@@ ani@@ ai Sch@@ uts , &quot; says Go@@ bay , chairman of the Chief of the National Council .
he wants to know that J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i knows that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , apart from that , under the constant thre@@ ats of a military personnel , is living in arm@@ ing educ@@ ators and healthcare services .
Go@@ bay says that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , like other Papua , their voice for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; debt , &quot; which he must pay back .
&quot; you don &apos;t need money , they are only righteousness . &quot; he says .
despite the threat of thre@@ ats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the P@@ ani@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ ers , a recent symbolic act of Trotsky@@ ites : the bodies of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station .
you know , that maybe you will never forget justice , but at least they do not forget their crimes against their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family became killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with b@@ lown head .

fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai to the second time
a fire found on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai with its passage and zw@@ ang hundreds of inhabitants , dating from the 337 meter high , 79 @-@ story building .
it is the second fire , which is situated in just two years through the high @-@ house , that is called random &apos;s Tor@@ ch tower ( F@@ ack@@ el tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of flam@@ me .
we have slaugh@@ tering and we have enjoyed the fire@@ alarm and write to write the people .
we know the steps down to the steps , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50th floor , &quot; told a residents who told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dub@@ ais civilian authorities said that the units of the fire control against 4.@@ 00 PM local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) is the fire to get a fire and the building cooling .
the government said they work on the provision of accommodation for the person affected .
the case , questions concerning the safety of materials that are used in external areas of high schools around the world will be re@@ revi@@ ved .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch @-@ building was revealed by the fire in 2015 , that the largest part of damages of the machine covers , the outer cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation .
in Great Britain , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and machine covers in the London Gren@@ fell tower in June has contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June , around 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen with his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
at the meeting in Ho @-@ Chi Min@@ h &apos;s town , the Davis Cup was not only supported by two new releases , Davis @-@ Cup and not only supported by two @-@ thirds majority in the required two @-@ thirds majority .
although often very long , however , this is therefore extremely estimated five @-@ set classic stay in the traditional market .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member countries approved for the reform , the target of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore just barely missed .
&quot; we resp@@ ects this decision but are dis@@ appointed that our member states did not have adopted the entire reform package for Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
we need to secure a change in order to secure the long @-@ term future of these icon@@ ographic and historical events , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty .
one will continue to improve the application to improve the applications .
not only for the vote , after many branches , before the sugges@@ tion had come to a neutral place , the final on a neutral place .
new from 2018 only are compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will in future host the host right in the first round .
to reduce the costs for the organizers to reduce the requirements in terms of exercise tables , etc . , and players will need less official media appoint@@ ments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 U.S. travel@@ er brings you to the aircraft , you will find a survey .
a survey carried out by a flight mode act that more than 20 percent is deliberately refurbished or un@@ consci@@ ously raised objects in accordance with the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , among them at least 6 percent , the airplane rates , while they may seem to be acci@@ dental kni@@ ves or other objects with Klin@@ gen .
in less than 1 percent claimed it would have been late that they were ir@@ cul@@ tured with weapons of weapons , am@@ mun@@ i@@ tions or explo@@ sives .
the survey carried out more than 1,000 people - designed by a Jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ Service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also noted that younger travellers could be ab@@ used for the rules .
the respon@@ dents said that they were forbidden to fly with something to fly from the T@@ SA , 19,@@ 7 percent Millennium than , compared with less than 15 percent , members of the Generation X were banned .
the most common objects that have been seen on T@@ SA agents , were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent gave birth to know@@ ingly items to have carried out by security control due to security control , while 2.2 percent of women respon@@ dents said , and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents agreed that they had taken refuge in the plane .
the company said , it took place in the whole country to find out how many acci@@ sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ are through the airport safety and how many it did have done .
it &apos;s no surprise that people who want to migr@@ ated to the most sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ are - know@@ ingly , or un@@ certain - by security , those were to fly the most common .
the company demonstrates that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confused .
the people are often un@@ certain that liquids are allowed to take fluids or how much of them .
it &apos;s no surprise that the largest amount of the T@@ SA &apos;s largest objects can be banned fluids .
a long time , the people who could see the T@@ SA could see books as sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ware .
liquids are allowed to pl@@ ough@@ ing , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k there is no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla .
electric @-@ thous@@ and@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k are like to have a huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla Model Model 3 .
so far , he has so far under@@ gone that a part of the customers had already pulled their in@@ feed reservation again .
in addition to the always tri@@ but@@ t numbers , Tesla CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has submitted a more impressive figure for the first time at the announcement of the latest quarterly results for the first time that the canc@@ ell@@ ations made at the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k in recent months , Mus@@ k had often made more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car in recent months .
now Mus@@ k turned into a : from a total of 5@@ 18.000 pre @-@ orders 6@@ 3,000 have been withdrawn again .
critics had always pointed out , that it is just a binding reservations .
when cancellation paid up the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 ) and the UK 1000 Po@@ unds ( US $ 1000 ) .
currently , 45@@ ,000 of such un@@ expect@@ edly reservations before , Sp@@ ree Mus@@ k is one of the telephone conference with analysts at the moment .
that the cancellation of only twelve percent of all orders will be given to the problem , the Tesla boss could not believe .
his argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth targets are not in demand , but on the production site .
last year , Tesla was delivered to 8@@ 4,000 vehicles last year .
2018 now - all models were taken together - 500.000 , by 2020 one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , a day 1800 reservations may be booked per day 1800 .
those who reck@@ on today in the second half of 2018 , if Tesla managed to reduce its brand new ways without larger inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum load capacity in the second half of 2018 .
many experts , that this is possible .
however , it comes to larger del@@ ays , then the un@@ binding posts could be given to the problem for Tesla .
because then the company is un@@ happy customers not able to meet the company un@@ satisfied customers .
EPA @-@ CEO P@@ ru@@ itt moves themselves due to the execution of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules back to reduce emissions .
a day after having been committed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , his former decision to en@@ forced the implementation of the Obama era , to reduce emissions of Smo@@ g substances .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency had to meet the needs of government agencies across the reaction @-@ faster than previous tests .
he mentioned the complaint against his previous place in a Federal Constitutional Court .
it is about a deadline that ran on October 1st for states , in order to hold the standards of 2015 for the floor of o@@ zone .
P@@ ru@@ itt , in June , he announced the observ@@ ance to study of a year , to avoid the authority to study more time to avoid the plan and economic growth in local decisions . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp prosecutor from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable enemy on environmental protection legislation .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed into existence , re@@ trac@@ ting the chemical industry and to del@@ aying the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the youngest legal responsibility for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory back agenda .
last month , a Federal State Court decided that the EPA delay has exceeded its authority when he tried to implement the implementation of a Obama administration , the oil and gas companies for monitoring and reduction of meth@@ an@@ l@@ atives .
in a Wednesday evening opinion , P@@ ru@@ itt was made sure that its swe@@ eping line at o@@ zone has just simply the willingness to meet the cooperation with the states due to the complex process of jus@@ tification of the new standards .
&quot; under former Wo@@ tions , the EPA often did not be met for the execution and then to be maintained by activ@@ ating groups and others , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who gave the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; we believe not to a Regulation by jurisdiction , and we assume Fri@@ sten .
we also take the law and the authority that there are us . &quot;
nevertheless the value of the EPA proposed that P@@ ru@@ pe@@ ach sometime down his &quot; powers to delay and all other copyright , &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; are based on a solid politics and the best available information . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in the Congress is under@@ way back on a comprehensive novel@@ ty of the o@@ zone .
one of the last month of approved law on the implementation of the rules should be delayed by at least eight years .
the project was not granted to the Senate in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney General , who led the Coalition led the Coalition led to the states of the states that the EPA did in this week , said the group intended to jus@@ tify the statutory pressure .
the return of the EPA - according to our ring@@ ing - is an important profit for health and safety of this 6,7 million New York &apos;s and the more than 115 million Americans who are being affected by Smo@@ g , &quot; said eng@@ th@@ man . &quot;
new York joined this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , London , New Mexico , Oregon , Ver@@ mont and Washington , and the District of Columbia .

the standardized smo@@ g can cause considerable problems in sensitive groups of people and every year to thousands of premature death cases .
representatives of the public health course and the environmental protective worker , more than P@@ ru@@ vers@@ ing course change .
it is very quiet , how much pressure it needs to get this reasonable step from the entity responsible for the protection of the air that we need to receive one , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity .

Mo@@ ores Ford massacre : activists lead ra@@ cial Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice .
a 1948 @-@ Benz Ford Mercury drove through a group of viewers in the rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and ru@@ mp@@ ed on the Ford bridge of Moore .
before the car that had four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group of white men came with ri@@ fl@@ age to block its way to block .
the Leader of the Mo@@ bs - a man middle ages in a needle crash - took a long train to his cigar@@ ette and made test through the wind@@ screen .
dr@@ ens the occup@@ ants in fear for fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to buy this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; brood @-@ out of the man . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the car ! &quot;
spr@@ inkle with the silence , as a young black man from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene was played on July 22nd , just a follow @-@ up .
but if then a scar@@ ves around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; is thrown , sti@@ cky almost all in the audience very genuine S@@ eu@@ f@@ zer .
since 2005 , civil rights is back to the Moore &apos; Ford Bridge , in order to im@@ itate the night in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u K@@ Lux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one has been charged because of the murder .
it is really true that in all these years no one person was arrested - even though we know it in our municipalities , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps to maintain the organisation &apos;s organisation .
it is a dirt fl@@ eck at a history , but it is a load for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year old former Congress of Georgia , Georgia , and a life in civil society .
it serves for him as an dramatic call for the action and introduces an annual memory of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that an accident was never corrected .
&quot; we want to en@@ forcement we want to see the termination , we want to try , but first we need to receive justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
we can not get to healing and reconciliation , until we get justice . &quot;
a court medi@@ ate sets a bed nets on the bodies one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ne on 27 July 1946 .
according to F@@ BI , the N@@ BC News purchased by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men of Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected .
but none of none was ever charged .
although the susp@@ ects has been on free on @-@ free walking , civil rights will tell you that double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch campaigns in the whole city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court ruling that had held the black citizens in Georgia for the first time ever to place her voice for the first time .
approximately at the same time as the election of the F@@ BI of the black colour watch@@ man Roger Mal@@ col@@ com signed a white basic owner , Bar@@ nice H@@ ester , during a struggle - allegedly because of a woman .
Bro@@ oks said that the rum@@ ors had been slaugh@@ tered in the city , that h@@ ester had been slaugh@@ tered by Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy , and that the baby , that she came from her husband .
on July 25 , 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white @-@ owner owner , 600 dollars to liber@@ ate from prison , the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her Cou@@ c@@ ousin Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey as a prison .
but when she went away from prison , and the Moore &apos; s Ford Bridge closer , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b reached the car .
as it was out , it was Har@@ rison who has prepared the Mor@@ de and ordered Mor@@ rison , closes a F@@ BI Report .
it is also obvious that there was a conspi@@ racy between governmental and local criminal law , which was not only involved in the Mor@@ den , evi@@ den@@ ced and the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Bro@@ oks &apos;s formulated to it .
he was an elect@@ oral massacre , &quot; he said .
they were all killed , in order to send a message to black people in this community , &quot; If you register for you , and if you want to vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
almost a decade , Cass@@ and@@ ra Gre@@ ene has led the yearly desc@@ ending of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is vivi@@ dly , taken up and is in a kind of deepest rac@@ ism , by which many believe that he had no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to look and look at more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that the point of the point is .
we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ne , since then we will be confronted with his feet in us all , &quot; said it . &quot;
but I cannot wait any relationship to you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me , or do not hear , what I have done . &quot;
the samples for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , nearly 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest Black - into a room and loud , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview over the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ at@@ co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the chef @-@ C@@ lan@@ mit@@ es for years , but he said , the role will never be easier .
&quot; I feel very dirty because I am not so called , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
but I think it &apos;s very important to get this history at the life , because we would not want to return to these times . &quot;
on the other side of the room , the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ hid , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nice H@@ ester play their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ col@@ com , the h@@ ester @-@ cri@@ es and it ou@@ sted , w@@ ishing that he has slaugh@@ tered with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; I said , n --- , disappeared from my property ! &quot;
sh@@ utt@@ er@@ wi@@ dert the fire .
there is a break .
and then breaks any ( at least all black actor ) in Gel@@ dings .
Gre@@ ene battle at the quiet .
&quot; what ? &quot; asked for Ras@@ hid .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
I was hard to hart ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , always ki@@ ch@@ ern@@ d .
&quot; I believe not that white people have at that time &apos; n --- er &apos; . &quot;
&quot; &quot; , &quot; wit@@ zel@@ te one of the other black performer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you only need to meet the hard &quot; R. &apos; . &quot;
and exactly there was the energy in the room , a feeling of the camera was replaced by un@@ comfortable .
everyone is busy making that right , not only because of the game but also because of memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins once .
this time when Ras@@ cona to say the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no battle .
this repe@@ tition is violent and fast .
there are Schre@@ ie , shots and then silence .
a woman , with a Trau@@ om , stands out over the bodies of actors , and Bil@@ lie Holidays , &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; .
her voice breaks in any second word .
approximately one hundred metres behind it , it is a group of about four dozen people of silence and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost uniform between black and white .
a couple is out of I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the road .
they all experienced an almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as cr@@ ushed moisture when bro@@ oks leads on a pilgrimage to the tomb of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the Mor@@ de has remained an Ane@@ k@@ d@@ ote but now , if one found on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , feels the air over@@ clock .
if the last sheet music of the songs sound , gre@@ et the quantity of a closer to come and the bodies of the bodies .
children &apos;s ho@@ cken to their heads , register the type of blood and the silent body and bl@@ ings each other .
&quot; you are not really dead &quot; , mur@@ derer from a little boy to remember that .
after some minutes , the quantity of the amount - and suddenly is over .
the actors t@@ oss the Lyn@@ chs@@ eil and w@@ ishing their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw rel@@ ates Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit which has played the C@@ lan@@ a .
Nick Ras@@ cona ab@@ ar@@ mt two of his co @-@ player and breaks into their poor wine , and the emotional burden of the performance was finally caused by him .
&quot; it is ok@@ ay , &quot; volati@@ le one of the women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this from one reason . &quot;
later the audience thank@@ ed together with the actors for dinner together .
in a table pl@@ ains a white pair of Atlanta , excited to a black pair , which they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski was able to find words that the performance has left the performance .
it &apos;s hard to hear this terrible words and de@@ eds to listen to ... of people who do not look like you like , &quot; she said , &quot; said it . &quot;
what is really true with me , I believe that the Lyn@@ chen always goes further , &quot; added them , &quot; today it is called the police station &quot; today . &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks Hof on his table , he and reminds of the civil rights .
he said , he started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the draw@@ back is in a certain way , because she describes the terror of what we have , but it &apos;s also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so if we don &apos;t learn from this , it can happen again .
who don &apos;t know his own story , who don &apos;t know his own story , is to repeat them to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmer@@ ung &quot; stimul@@ ating the Wagner &apos;s Wagner in Bayreuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a blu@@ unt @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e performance , six @-@ story stage .
the shooting stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows you with the above @-@ lasting street corner with the Berlin rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR @-@ times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before being par@@ ked a open Mercedes @-@ classic car , as a Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
cast oil can remember Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ mo@@ tiv , Money , power and Gi@@ er - which moves through his &quot; Ring &quot; -@@ staged .
the three Rhein@@ killing - donated by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ize like in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; as early as &apos; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
K@@ ess she perform Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , cr@@ ushed into Hollywood , mani@@ fold into the trunk area and give the Kra@@ etz@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the glorious Hagen , which gives the A@@ ura of an heavy @-@ weight box@@ ers .
brut@@ ally beaten the scene , when he poured the scene .
later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) must be dr@@ ink@@ able .
the audience thank@@ ed the ensemble with a powerful appl@@ ause .
over@@ m@@ ally , Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who refused the modest and hands of Merkel @-@ Rau@@ th .
great support for the Festival Orchestra , which shows the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in legends .
the performance was expected to have been followed by Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ ons team .
in 2013 , he had to go through a g@@ ellen@@ y of the Pfei@@ f@@ concert , there were five years later big Ju@@ bel , in which the fallen single &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; went down .
in Katharina Wagner , Katharina Wagner are looking forward to have a pleasure .
it noted that the audience with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way has grown in a certain way , &quot; she had said before the performance of d@@ pa .
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also a understanding for his sight .
I am a positive conclusion .
max amount works as volunteers
they work in their volunteers at the same time in several locations .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in quar@@ emet@@ ers in the furniture industry , once in the week I was in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have worked in the open all day at the school .
how are your experience ?
amount : it is a beautiful , broad spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with young adults , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late volunteer volunteers .
how does that ?
a lot : I have done it .
and then a construction of engineering , let &apos;s say good@@ bye to success .
I recognized for me that it is for me the Fal@@ sche is and I want to make anything else to work with people .
and then I asked myself asked myself what you do .
Mach a social year , as there is an insight , as you can see , as it can be seen on site , in fuel , maybe even , really is .
and was it so ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social term my studies in the winter semester .
I will study dual study , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , a social worker and studies in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not something unusual , while the volunteers are several different types of applications ?
amount : yes , it is very variable .
there is probably always to be connected , where you will make his FS@@ J .
it is possible to work from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
at me it was very varied .
I also partially partially in the O@@ GS , thus in the follow @-@ up period .
for me , this was exactly the right reason for me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs .
unlike in the construction of engineering ?
amount : well , it &apos;s clear , here it &apos;s not enough to avoid st@@ ati@@ ken .
it always has more people pre @-@ m head , each one has a very different story behind .
whether a refugee , whether a youth , who has been picked up out of the family - one must be individually agreed upon .
very interesting .
and you don &apos;t had any touch @-@ anxi@@ ous ?
amount : for this I am not the type .
it is a area that gives a lot .
much love , plenty of kindness .
there is also a negative moments , but so is that life .

EPA returns decision to delay of the smo@@ g Rule to Kl@@ ages
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to del@@ aying a regulation of Obama administration , lifted by which the states are obliged to provide the Smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was taken after 15 states due to the stri@@ es .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ provisions 2015 &quot; to drive , and said it is the obligation to work with states .
we believe in the dialogue with and that we react to our state partner , &quot; said EPA @-@ boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement .
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA , the o@@ zone provisions must be measured in which some of the country &apos;s poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions are to be carried out in order to exceed the stric@@ ter air quality standards - to be delayed until October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , handed out on Tuesday law@@ suit and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to destroy a wide range of environmental protection , former President Barack Obama imposed , when part of a wider agenda , which according to Tru@@ mp shall drive to the economic growth .
the efforts have however triggered the backs of Dem@@ ok@@ rates and nature @-@ groups that make wor@@ ries about the effects of larger emissions to the public health .
the website of the EPA says that the calibration of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the pul@@ mon@@ ary function and the breath@@ able sympt@@ om@@ ome can be intensi@@ fied &quot; as for example Az@@ th@@ ma .
in common , common room
at the end , the decision was made clear : in two counter@@ vote , the Sh@@ orn @-@ Win@@ kler decides to enter the facility of a shared space in the future .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing basic piece is signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades .
though it will last until the date of the parish church is located in the town council , but there are now no plan for use in a private investor project more .
there is a discussion regarding a joint period .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat , is offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor , it would be a living area - around 55 square meters and a adjoining terrace with at least 70 square meters floor space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the majority , such a common space is not considered to be the meeting point for residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ able housing , but open to the church in the church .
as an example , the word made by the &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round .
the decision taken by the provision of funding for the current household already has been decided in the past autumn .
the construction is in the san@@ itation area .
for the establishment of a common space , T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent conve@@ ys .
the decision sees that you would like to take advantage of the investor that there is no cra@@ cker between the legs - which is based on the environment - as well as p@@ ent roof - which reduces the tr@@ un@@ ces and the construction of economic power - as well as possible .
unnecessary , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer remains that addition .
if &quot; s helps , the panel of the Board had unanimously .
it &apos;s not so easy it goes to the community .
Daniela Sper@@ ing refers to the many own building , with which you can not get quite right , get the rest of the shared room from the window , says it : &quot; I do not have to do so . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger speaks for the common community , however , absolutely against a municipal participation .
in the case you can also see a covered maximinum payout of it or even foreign investors .
that is not so , because with the acquisition of the area , you don &apos;t have an allow@@ ance , but get a real role in the case of doubt the counter @-@ setting is the counter@@ point .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers request , to agree the resolutions of the resolutions , will find three impair@@ ments .
so it remains with two counter@@ point in the original program , Stefan H@@ aller , &quot; If we summ@@ ari@@ ze the decision to close a giant step in our infrastructure . &quot;

reproduction Hoffmann : &quot; triple work works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes after the 2 : 2 season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes that the optimization of def@@ ensive formation is launching in Au@@ e points .
with the first win of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the result , it would not be the two counter @-@ ore with 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; that were two opponent , too much , and we need to fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the defender of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf .
in the Erz@@ gebirge , the Tri@@ erk@@ ette will continue to be optimised .
and a gate after a fre@@ igh@@ tw@@ ise , we would not want to see even more .
for the future there will be so that no more next to Michael ( R@@ ensing ) to the line will no longer exist . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team also concerns the experience in preparation with the tripod for the tripod thanks to the experience .
I don &apos;t know how we have to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says Hoffmann is a thing in the tri@@ erk@@ ette to the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko casting @-@ el@@ mann players who can play well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; pre@@ condition is , however , that we even better harmon@@ ize and let us feel so much as much errors . &quot;
of course Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; whether you &apos;re talking about a mis@@ sense start , don &apos;t know it .
the performance could be quite ok@@ ay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; if we &apos;re on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the Trophy , we will surely talk about the opening of the season . &quot;
it &apos;s nothing to know his coach .
in the season I won only after six till eight days of days , &quot; Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who would not talk about an advantage over to Au@@ e , because the game of Saxony &apos;s play in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken because of an accident .
now , you can start the season early with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that player from Au@@ e might be somewhat more intense , because they did not have a heavy and full game like Fort@@ una to asc@@ end the bones . &quot;
but they don &apos;t know so 100 percent , where they are currently , &quot; says the inner def@@ ending of Fort@@ una .
although guests are going to the Rhineland as a lighter favorite on Sunday at the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium in Au@@ e .
&quot; that means that we are going to come , only because we are entitled to come under the first six , Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ sense , &quot; says Funk@@ body , whose balance is positive in only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games .
there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , that you have to beat away by fore@@ going . &quot;
such statement were ar@@ ro@@ gant and over@@ Hebrew . &quot;
and thus Funk@@ body will experience his players on Sunday at a case .
new results of the Swedish Asyl@@ um assessment tests were published
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who were under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested older than 18 years are older than 18 years . but not everyone believe the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ ens@@ ity Medicine ( puzzle origin ) has begun with the implementation of the tests in the past year .
they should be more precise during the asylum seek@@ ers of the age , after the Swedish Mig@@ r@@ ational authority ( Mig@@ r@@ ation pi@@ et ) was cri@@ tici@@ zed for the evaluation of the correct age of some refugees .
up to date , Mig@@ r@@ asp@@ hal@@ et 6.@@ 880 to test@@ ers and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eight percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine was revealed that the person could possibly be &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; possibly be under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are carried out only in cases where the person is provided in question .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are resistant in recent months .
we see no significant difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; said the magazine The Local .
the high proportion of cases reported in which the person was judged over 18 years , means that the asylum seek@@ ers came to his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that it has 4@@ 42 cases , &quot; states that the investigated for 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bla@@ det the 5@@ 81 results published , they noted that in 243 of these cases the person said that they would be 18 years old .
the method of medical activity assessment , in the x @-@ rays of wisdom teachings and MRI images of Kni@@ fe , which are analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , were also cri@@ tici@@ zed in some areas .
a sc@@ ep@@ tics is the End@@ oc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus at the Kar@@ olin@@ ska Institute , whose work was to see the evaluation of biological maturity of people , to see whether they were so@@ oner or later than usually through the Pu@@ ber@@ ths .
&quot; I had the reason to think about it , and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .
to assess the biological age on this way , is very un@@ certain .
if we don &apos;t say it to say , we should not as if we could , &quot; said the newspaper metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of an adult is not able to assess the risk of an adult .
the largest risk of this , if the person is under 18 , in this case these case are about 10 percent . &quot;

tradition is the Danish König@@ sp@@ aar in the Dom@@ kirche Church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard has already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the queen &apos;s decision to agree with the decision of her husband , said it was in the communication .
where Prince Hen@@ rik I say , is still un@@ clear .
however , he did not have the intention to be buried in his French home .
Prince Hen@@ rik never made a bun@@ ch of what he was not happy with his title .
after the Thr@@ on@@ struction of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have become king .
in 2016 he went into retirement and gives the title &quot; princ@@ eb@@ hl . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik is not the title and the function I wanted to see , behold , he did not see before his wife , not even after the death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , chief editor of the Danish king house .
where the last rest@@ ing place of the 83 year @-@ old will eventually be finally unc@@ le@@ ar .
however , he did not have the intention to be buried in his French home , but in Denmark .
he likes the country that has worked for the last 50 years .
the native of Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristo@@ cracy , Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 met in London .
he worked at the Th@@ ames in the French Embassy .
during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik always flew to the people , Prince Hen@@ rik , had always had a serious status in its almost 50 @-@ year reg@@ ent@@ ance .
in a auto@@ biography about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival was everything , what I did , cri@@ tici@@ zed .
my Danish was pregnant , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk and sh@@ u@@ pr@@ es instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Citroën , Volvo , tennis .
even for the Gau@@ dium , which I was smoking in instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco , and the latter had to be the reputation of social intellec@@ tuals , I couldn &apos;t hope to hope .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not sk@@ ate me .
that were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants to add rapid re @-@ election
CDU and F@@ DP in front of one majority in Lower Saxony
the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green government , will reti@@ re for a rapid re@@ election of the landing , but will not occur .
because he said on Friday for the dissolution of Parliament .
previously , the surprising exit of a Gre@@ ens @-@ MP@@ s from its land@@ marks in Lower Saxony were over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a heavy crisis .
five months before the official meeting of the country @-@ election the red @-@ green Coalition led to the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover during the order for the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the existing Gre@@ ens Green Mem@@ bers El@@ ke Twe@@ sten established its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in its elect@@ oral circuit in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future at the CDU , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover on Friday .
CDU &apos;s subsidiary Björ@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend it to our Group to record it .
in the meantime , CDU and F@@ DP had together 69 seats in the Lower Saxony @-@ Land@@ tag , SPD and Grü@@ ne 68 .
so far the proportion was vice vers@@ a .
the new Land Day is elected regular , dated 14 January 2014 .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler told the red green country Government now , whether they may continue in this situation without a majority .
however , Stephan Weil keeps it possible for an estimated that the country &apos;s landing as fast as fast as fast as quickly .
the CDU faction will be expected to decide on Tuesday through you .
the Landes@@ ver@@ ge can also see the possibility that the day of the Prime Minister , the trust authority and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
these options have to be tested , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; you will discuss any questions on peace , if they are legally reasonable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ West @-@ Step &quot; but something curi@@ osity . &quot;
the policy of political himself stressed : &quot; I am not guilty .
I feel very good . &quot;
they called the black green of black @-@ green .
the Green Party demanded the ab@@ r@@ asp@@ ge member for the return of their land rights .
we are naturally , of course that she received her Land@@ tag@@ and@@ ate , that she has received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; shared the Provin@@ cial Met@@ a Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner .
s leader of the Green Party An@@ ja Pi@@ el said , &quot; we require the decision of El@@ ke Twe@@ sten . &quot;
they decided to make no exc@@ use in the faction .
&quot; even before the background that there are no content differences , we can not re@@ boot this step . &quot;
in Martin Schulz , the SPD @-@ Chancellor Martin Schulz sets the role of the Lower Saxony @-@ MP@@ s El@@ ke Twe@@ sten to CDU as a betra@@ yal .
the behavior of the former Gre@@ ens @-@ MP@@ s in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the vot@@ ers and vot@@ ers , but also betra@@ yal of red green , &quot; wrote the chief of the Social @-@ Democrats in the Friday on Facebook .
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , who will soon be able to choose the country &apos;s landing day .
the exit of the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs red green in Lower Saxony &apos;s majority .
the policy of policy &quot; in their last erup@@ ted , and in their Fr@@ ust her personal interests have been cri@@ tici@@ zed the W@@ ohl of the country , cri@@ tici@@ zed the SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus , .
&quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CDU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty in@@ feed play and tried to beat the political capital . &quot;
in the meantime , Lower Saxony &apos;s CDU president Björ@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to do his MP@@ s , El@@ ke Twe@@ sten will take up to CDU .
the Fra@@ ction of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw himself of twe@@ sts , with personal carto@@ ons , the result of the Land election 2013 .
the CDU was the most powerful force in front of the SPD , SPD and Grü@@ ne , but in the Land@@ tag , but a narrow majority of a voice .
agriculture - How do we protect us against Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ ern , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discussed over disease eggs .
how could happen that sc@@ andal will happen ?
how can protect consumers .
Federal Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is talking in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , How can protect consumers before poison@@ ed eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers , to watch the eggs in your refrigerator - exactly to watch the p@@ isti@@ ls print .
on the Consumer Protection , www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the states requested the latest information about the affected eggs .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if we are currently we know what we currently know , a health content is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di will take the best possible crisis for action - all the eggs taken out of the offer - because the central role of the procedure is not really true ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house can be immediately connected and has been in the close exchange of Germany in the close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
the trade has just like the makers to worry about that sold @-@ sold products are capable and health .
if at eggs of the return ratio of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg it is exceeded , these are not possible .
however , un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time are not the farms .
sit and consumers in the same boat ?
following the line of line , the production companies are no immediate gu@@ ilt .
on the fact they must be reflected in terms of illegal de@@ priv@@ ation practices of service companies with economic damage .
as always , there is a little consu@@ mp@@ se in the harvest .
it is missing only on the staff or even in the wor@@ ding jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls , which have been uncovered .
however , the truth is also part of food and criminal energy is never to 100 percent .
just therefore , we are just a consistent role in such events and sur@@ render to the nationals in the cases where pen@@ ances are of a crucial importance .
I have already made it several times , that I acquired a l@@ enti@@ less information by the responsible authorities .
is the regular Alar@@ mis@@ m in food sk@@ and@@ als are necessary ?
the consumer groups and consumers have the right to get only safe and convenient food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cides is used in food industry , consumer groups , consumers and consumers .
because of the pan@@ cies , manufacturers , distributors and consumers have a situation , which is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pr@@ oni@@ l in the attitude of life @-@ contrac@@ ting animals is non @-@ acceptable , and must be finished immediately .
you have to be consistently performing on all levels and with high @-@ pressure .
I acquired from all the competent authorities , that the experts will increase and clari@@ fied by all the competent authorities .
how to get the financial regul@@ ator of the foot based on Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s to Paris .
the rules to target , in@@ filtr@@ ing expenditure of the European football , will not prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences are coming to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has been monitored by power , teams from the access to the prestigious Champions League Cup tournament .
financial Fair Play @-@ rules , which were launched in 2011 by UEFA in the UEFA &apos; s mean that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to purchase Brazil from its contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a content that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s to France .
PS@@ G can make sure the money is loosely to make Ne@@ ym@@ ar , and in a gal@@ axy of other stars , in view of the financing of the teams through the energy of Qatar .
compar@@ es the purchase of players a lot of money , but they must have al@@ locate high @-@ alloy sources to give them the break @-@ even point in their business to the soccer @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini , after his election to the UEFA President in 2007 .
the former French player was believed that one who had risen enormously high deb@@ ts in their way to success , effectively frau@@ dul@@ ent and ris@@ k@@ ed , when banks or the owners have moved their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from the concentration to the debt of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential bought and then greatly invested in order to improve the team and to build a global mark - to a tough@@ est matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P series , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take place losses in the amount of EUR 30 million .
and even though Plat@@ ini 2015 was fallen by the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ Ce@@ fer@@ in continued to continue to carry out some of spending issues .
surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will not intensi@@ fy the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the future of UEFA for FF@@ P , compared with The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause by Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for invoice by the duration of its treaty .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five @-@ year agreement , so that the det@@ achment for the next five years will be issued in the annual amount of EUR 4@@ 4.4 million .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions imposed in 2014 , the PS@@ G combined with Abu Dhabi which is located in the possession of Manchester City , with the utmost sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , and it was arranged to 20 million euros for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
the UEFA is looking for clubs , which might try to over@@ list their financial support by making their income by companies who are associated with the owners of a clubs .
while a cataly@@ tic companies could exceed the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ings should exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA would not be considered a legitimate income .
exactly the happened in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the value of sponsor@@ ship of the PSA Tourism Authority was cancelled .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G @-@ payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar on payments of the Organi@@ zing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar could come .
but PS@@ G and Qatar was cont@@ ested that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World ambassador will be able to find Ne@@ ym@@ ar World ambassador to find out a special maneu@@ vers for the UEFA regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA still is eye @-@ eye , to note an attempt to keep the rules .
the UEFA had no pre @-@ prepared talks with PS@@ G over Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s transfer , fabulous on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they said to discuss the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity by The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not fu@@ elled to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports indicate that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieves a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year are still to be published .
PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s is a blessing for Sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , Mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales .
the association assumes that the turnover will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing of the signature .
the Spanish league was clear , one of the best football stri@@ ker to see one of the best football player , and she attempted to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s to prevent them that PS@@ G would inf@@ rin@@ gement .
it is a clear case of &quot; financi@@ ally &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS @-@ based daily newspaper AS .
Arsenal Manager Ar@@ s@@ ene Wen@@ ger , whose organisation is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , the pre @-@ orders of La League for a state that was financed by a society .
it is the consequence of the owners and that has been completely changed in the past 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday .
as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible .
it &apos;s very difficult to resp@@ ects the financial Fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or different interests if one country has a so big actor in order to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is based on the search of a new Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ ants
in the past years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board fre@@ y chocolate has been made for the Swiss company .

Swiss spokes@@ person in Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ ess confirmed on request the news agency S@@ DA a corresponding report by the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning the Air@@ line will hold a new contract in the first half of 2018 .

industry in@@ sider estimate the order volume in accordance with &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; by 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effective : for a Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ raffe design , it is a pres@@ tige task .
as many applicants from the new tender , the Swiss will not exceed the Swiss Life .
in question , but only Swiss manufacturers are only Swiss manufacturers .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y is planning a renewal of the Treaty establishing the spring of 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the largest Swiss chocolate @-@ chocolate manufacturer cannot be reached for an opinion .
chocolate @-@ chocolate plates distri@@ butes the Swiss Life since 2006 on board of their flights .
before the Swiss contract signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Bar@@ ry C@@ alle@@ baut in cooperation with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets .
the opportunity to place the logo was Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with different Swiss chocolate chocolate producers .

as a cultural centre , it &apos;s equally well @-@ known as a cultural heritage and a wiring of our Facebook @-@ enabled era .
but when Franchise feels feels like Franchise , I would remain at the time .
the First Day of Camp &quot; func@@ tioned surprisingly good , not only because of his absur@@ d the hum@@ or ( it contained a original history for speaking vegetables , which was found by H. Jon Benjamin ) .

one point of s@@ bert is a character through an Apple Power@@ Book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a series of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the ador@@ able Coop ( Mr. Show@@ old ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) still not forgotten .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost its jungle .
and there is another crazy rock lot , in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ age ) , the now of George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) is supported .
as always , the random courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it makes a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ avi@@ lions shows , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now feels like an old fl@@ acker .
they are the moments of random orbit , like a way of repeated &quot; Seven up ! &quot; the &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the show &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon reminds of a different kind of no@@ stal@@ gia : on the re@@ vit@@ alisation of the Cold War , &quot; to the film &quot; Ato@@ mic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even at &quot; G@@ low , &quot; with his East @-@ to @-@ West Ring@@ fight .

with six long episodes , there is then , and the comedy is not fast or frequently enough .
the Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , who had to deliver a lower length , could deliver the Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re , since Gregor , and I@@ os@@ ef are always occupied to the American Embassy , which is always occupied by two thick males , who were ro@@ oted in Hamburg .
the message for the imag@@ ined communist audience is that the western culture will make all feed for a feed for money .
the fic@@ tive Romanian cre@@ ator were not wrong : we even make it even with our own more recent history and the ih@@ lava .
hit against drugs m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police succeeded in turn a blow against the Italian M@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .

in addition , the official public amounts of Mari@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine , weapons weapons and several hundred thousands of thousands of Euro .
on the same ra@@ ids in Italy two people were arrested for two people .
against the two susp@@ ects , German arrest warran@@ ts were issued .
therefore , the two are therefore extra@@ d@@ ited to Germany .
in action , Italian and Bavarian investigations were involved in the action .
overall , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the members of the M@@ af@@ ia organised drug abuse , violent violence , attempted murder , as well as Rau@@ b and tor@@ sion .
since the summer of 2016 , the Public Prosec@@ ution Service was established in the southern German area since summer 2016 .
between the nationals in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , a re@@ ty exchange and investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had nearly daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
therefore , the large insert on Wednesday tomorrow also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in particular , the investigation of the investigations carried out all Italian nation@@ ally with reference to the Italian M@@ af@@ ia .
also a incident was fired on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , in the morning , several shots have been fired into a guest facility , probably to the account of the Ban@@ de .
in the way , large L@@ aps in the foreig@@ ner registers
&quot; data from citizens , which should not occur &quot; : a report , according to the foreig@@ ner shows significant defici@@ encies in Germany .
the guide to part of def@@ ends of Asyl@@ um procedures for asylum procedure .
the Federal Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Service , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has been aware of a media report according to a media report in the country @-@ country register .
the defici@@ encies of the registered data could lead to asylum method for asylum procedures and deportation . &quot; lead in an analysis called the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; .
according to the register , 10 million people affected with foreign nationals , including about 5.7 million from non @-@ EU states .
the data will be administered in Germany by approximately 600 Foreign agencies in Germany .
because the data is not sufficient to be kept , be the data quality in parts so far .
in individual cases the dates of 1921 had been found , &quot; by people who have had no longer on life , or by citizens , who have become German citizens , have no longer to be used in the gri@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data have been significantly more slow , &quot; says the report according to the report .
in the statistics about check @-@ out people of the EU citizens , they do not have to travel .
such false assignment , however , led to a debate about dealing with departure , &quot; means it means that the analysis is in the analysis .
meanwhile , the Federal Government would have begun to send a refugee families with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children back to Italy when they come from there .
the winner of an internal paper from the Federal am@@ ts for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) reports that the &quot; New Osnabrück co@@ ach@@ cker newspaper &quot; report .
in paper it means that the B@@ AM@@ F guide such methods for families with children - with the exception of acid and small children - to Italy since June 1 , 2017 .
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation .
after the Dublin agreement , he is responsible for refugees in the EU state , which she first reached first .
if a Mig@@ rant may continue to go into another EU country , this state can be returned him to the destination .
for the reason that the Office is now : &quot; by now the recording capacity has been increased considerably in Italy for families with min@@ der@@ u@@ dly children in Italy . &quot;
Italy bought for the recording and accommodation of families of warranty .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EG@@ MR ) contents are sufficient for enough .
other EU states would also send refugees in the context of the Dublin agreement there .
the internal policy to the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , cri@@ tici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children threatened by lack of man@@ ure , illegal recording conditions and a haz@@ ards of the child . &quot;

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is likely to announce that the interest rates remains unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the block@@ age of inflation caused a rise in the spec@@ ulations .
the Bank of England warned that the economic growth &quot; applications will remain in , when they put interest rates on family back in the middle of a reinforced print .
in this month , the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) earned the rate of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , whereby the weak economic growth includes the support for an increase in economic growth .
in their fourth annual inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 in 2018 that the pressure would come to the budget that inflation in autumn is likely to rise by almost 3 % .
but they are necessary that in the next few years , interest rates would be necessary to zü@@ chteten the Bre@@ x@@ ite , inflation , and she said that the loan costs may be paid more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also approved for this , a part of the Mam@@ mut activity package , which was published before a year after the Bre@@ x@@ ite .
it will challenge time for financial plan to provide the financial plan for banks in the coming February 2014 that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds in the frame of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling silver .
following the decision about the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , as the pressure on real income will continue to load the consumption . &quot;
among the interest rates repeated that &quot; a certain term of monetary policy &quot; for cooling , inflation and a &quot; somewhat wider &quot; extent would be expected to expect the markets .
the markets predicted the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
however , the Bank emphasized that accounts for &quot; gradually &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; would be carried out . &quot;
the Bank for this and next year the Bank for this and next year is predicted by 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared with the previous year .
she has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the po@@ und fell into this news against the dollar and the euro .
the po@@ und fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to make any change , after the recent dis@@ appoint@@ ments are increasing the increasing expectations rate to a rate of interest , and GDP growth in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months has risen to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to grow at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover by the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered a little enthusiasm for households , which will be affected by an increasing inflation and slightly more sal@@ low , because the disappearance is still worse before being registered afterwards .
in addition , it added that the monetary policy does not prevent the income of monetary policy , &quot; but they added , &quot; but they added the wages in the end of their three @-@ year plan . &quot;
the economy is being reinforced by rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which is compens@@ ated to the lower consumer expenditure .
the decision came a year after the reduction of interest rates to 0,@@ 25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the s@@ ine of the pl@@ ough@@ ing .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years , until this will reach the prices and the economy .
prior to the last judgement of the Bank on interest rates , the call to a rate of interest was increased , as inflation was increased on hard by hard rose by three political decision @-@ makers in July a rise to 0.5 % .
inflation is reduced from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that it has been expected to withdraw it in the coming months .
the Bank said the over@@ locking in relation to its goal of 2 % is to be &quot; quite &quot; to the weak Po@@ und .
Andrew Mont@@ dale , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ en@@ Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent return of the s@@ wap rate , the mort@@ gage market could happen again more competitive because the lending is very strong for many shops and the year in a positive way .
the market looks very good for those who include the existing De@@ als and the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with extra free options and low rates are increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Care ) is alleged to change HIV @-@ Dro@@ ge 10,000 people .
from September after a struggle against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS , in order to get access to a &quot; trans@@ form@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment .
N@@ HS England announced that one prior to sexual inter@@ course , pre@@ ex@@ cl@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xe ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of risk @-@ risk by around 86 percent , now it is estimated to be delivered by the health service for a first three @-@ year study .
he declared to finance the trial , after the App@@ eals Court confirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court for the last year , according to which the N@@ HS had to pay attention to the p@@ EP , despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should be financi@@ ally financed .
on Thursday , chess was announced by N@@ HS England &apos;s chief Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; , while the National Ai@@ ds Trust ( NAT ) was called the &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will come to the first that will follow the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October of 2018 in the whole of England .
pre@@ ex@@ cl@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xe ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV medic@@ ations that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of an HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre @-@ use HIV @-@ transmission was significantly reduced in infection .
pre@@ EP prior to sexual inter@@ course means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or just two hours before sexual inter@@ course .
one of those who come to the treatment , include fluctu@@ ating or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV @-@ positive partners who were not successfully treated with HIV @-@ positive partners .
in clinics , suitable participants were identified by the study , including men , women , transcoding and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment by anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who live in England and are registered in a house , can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will receive £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery in this week after an international competitive environment .
the study is to assess the entire potential of pre @-@ EP by clinical evidence , as it is implemented in a large scale , implemented and implemented .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should be the extensive and increasingly successful efforts to fill the prevention of HIV and over@@ take .
it is another milestone in which more than three decades , sustained progress in order to become one of the greatest health challenges of mankind . &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Committee ( National Ai@@ ds Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if there are specifically targeted and endanger@@ ed people , the possibility to modify the English HIV @-@ epide@@ mic .
from September to , people with high HIV @-@ risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and not with a partner , which leads to improving many , many lives .
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has left an risk of HIV .
now , as the Pre@@ EP test medicine was abol@@ ished , we are going to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
Shar@@ on Hodg@@ son , shade @-@ health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the pre @-@ EP process is welcome to monthly delay and cont@@ acted by the government .
the evidence showing how to trans@@ form@@ ative this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can finish the transfer of these life @-@ changing infection .
this trial brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study will be carried out as fast as possible in the whole country to protect HIV @-@ infected people , and that it will be able to add a step closer to the diss@@ em@@ ination of HIV in society . &quot;
the great life : mezzanine and smart designer tri@@ cks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment to a spacious home .
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former head with a passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 by a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has packed their bags and sold their pockets .
&quot; &quot; before I lived with my Ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court on me and they had the same high ceilings .
I loved me in them and made a special offer on this day . &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet large apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room estate with the layout layout - one has to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to take advantage of the spacious ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted to have high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; says it .
for this purpose she asked the architectural design and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; S@@ HE@@ D of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which is a 12.5 foot high ceilings and home to create a home but not only a development but also a place for life .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine to create a mezzanine where you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think of rede@@ em to solve the presentation .
the steel plant is pretty complicated , &quot; he explains .
we had to arrange the rooms that they were over@@ thrown in each other , without that we had to g@@ aps .
it didn &apos;t only say to build a simple platform , but the steel so that it had the right above or down the right height . &quot;
this arrangement has enabled it to place two rooms at full altitude - with plenty of additional drama .
for the mezzanine looks a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us over the gl@@ am@@ our@@ se living area .
finished gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and Vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in the execution of theatre , room and light .
on both ends , a short corridor will be installed to work for longer .
in the kitchen , the sp@@ eg@@ s feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , we will offer space for all the best corner and glasses by Jo@@ anne .
thanks to the perception of a gl@@ am@@ our@@ a Rau@@ ms , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if they are not used .
fully furnished kitchen , there are nothing new .
the most important characteristic of this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering art went since , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of steel @-@ reinforced MDF @-@ door .
&quot; it is essential so important that if you reach the door to the door , very easily g@@ led . &quot;
thanks to the clever usage of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to win extra 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
at the end of the day , you will sell the ground surface - or as your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
in a ru@@ ment@@ ary form , a real estate ad will act on a real estate and a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
here they managed to enlarge the floor space , and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that provides the space its luxurious advantage .
the materials are the things that you can touch and which therefore help to create an emotional binding in a home &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you don &apos;t feel right into the electric power outlets in walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment is characterized by good design and increased square feet of somewhat standard dimensions in a little bit sc@@ opes .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you might decide to leave this no .
brothers struggl@@ es to fight for a $ 500 million real estate
two brothers have four decades after their Italian family who founded the dyn@@ asty in one of the largest real estate in Vict@@ ori@@ as , worth more than 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and its assets should be divided .
Paul wanted to move from family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict with the separation will take place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers has collected 38 real estate in the value of more than one half billion dollars , since then the family bought a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
the West@@ co family founded Je@@ ans and grew up in a chain of 160 retail shops .
it was sold in 1999 for $ 85 million .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis includes offices in the pen@@ it@@ rum , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler , as well as shopping centers in the subur@@ bs .
following an agreement with their de@@ ceased father , Colin made by Paul as &quot; principal operators and the dominant personality in family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s wealth and Paul is roughly one third .
a judicial file says that this means that Colin made a value of USD 316 million and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the allocation of real estate and cash has proved itself for Paul as an empi@@ point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by Colin proposed deser@@ es have left him with the left what I held for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ vit in 2015 .
the first hearing of the Supreme Court ruling was held last Friday after several failed agents .
the brothers are now to fight with the control over the existing business - including Colin , like Paul claimed that he was excluded .
Colin argu@@ ed that this is not true , but th@@ read@@ ed Paul , some of their poss@@ essions .
in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ vit , which was filed by Colin made by Colin he hope he hope to fight against the fight .
he wrote my Italian heritage that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , among them Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both parties .
Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who operated dairy bars and delic@@ acies of the late 1950 @-@ 10 years and in the early se@@ venti@@ es a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick bought .
they use the safety to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in Colin made the first Je@@ ans@@ ary family .
Colin says that he began to use West@@ co there when he was &quot; during my last years , when Paul still was a small child ( about 10 years old ) .
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she died and Luigi , who died in the year 2012 , hop@@ ed to continue their property to their sons .
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land that the brothers said before , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are not part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , and Colin claims that Mark were paid for the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
both Luke and Mark are also , Paul &quot; says Paul &quot; over the conditions of their financial instruments . &quot;
Colin made himself very return , although it was a former AF@@ L member board and following a biography in 2015 by Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took on contact with Colin and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attack@@ ing contact .
only Colin answered by SMS , to say &quot; I can &apos;t say much , &quot; because the case before the dishes is .
it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to move me to rest@@ ing me and our family names through the dishes , &quot; he wrote .
in mid 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the Court that he tries to meet the demands of his brother .
our Father would not have been noted that Paul and I would do in our current fight , &quot; he said , and said , &quot; he said , &quot; said that it was still a solution . &quot;
this hope it seemed to be past .
in the near future , &quot; our affair is dissolved in the near future , &quot; he wrote Colin .
Tru@@ mps new Chief of Staff plans to include the media ab@@ in@@ ence of the president .
others are tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if yes , he will be the first .
poli@@ tico reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restri@@ ct information on President Tru@@ mp - including the reports of news media - in hope to keep the chief of a uniform course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey here :
when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , he gave his first working day with leading staff in his first day , he set up a main problem in President Donald Tru@@ mps White House , which he got to rep@@ ent@@ age : bad information about the hands of the president .
Kelly said the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or letter - because the President will meet the decisions that would be good information . &quot;
Win@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others tried to add Tru@@ mp to perfor@@ ated by using its media advice .
President Tru@@ mps relation to Television as well as decades - and now , where he is still in the White House , is still quite strong .
when the candidate of Tru@@ mp was due to an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show that he received a fair reporting of places that were to convince themselves , &quot; said the former elect@@ oral consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against poli@@ tico .
Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key , Tru@@ mps Twitter is under control , according to six former elect@@ oral fight in the fight , ensuring that his personal media account has a steady appeal . &quot;
ok@@ ay .
but the idea that Tru@@ mps Twitter is ever &quot; under control &quot; was ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
perhaps , this Kamp@@ agn@@ ers officials somewhat something what we do not know that Tru@@ mps twe@@ ets have included without their interventions , even more spark plug .
we will probably never experienced something about the Twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp cannot be sent .
when he made his colleague it has been able to hold a few times , sleeves of him , then their efforts was worth it .
but no one has been consistently prevent the Tru@@ mp Kon@@ tro@@ ver@@ sen .
a part of the problem is that people in a white house that set up in a white house , and again trying to present their own agenda by using Tru@@ mp material , which may support their views from the world .
poli@@ tico - all with this history - reported in May about the preparations of the advisor to the President of the strategic reasons .
this was an example that was described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
the current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react to negative press sections , especially those with cor@@ di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m angle , and that he would find out to find out where these origin@@ ate .
exactly that happened at the end of February when someone asked the President of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the site of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ateur @-@ in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; which was the source behind a bun@@ ch at the White House .
even though Johnson was ex@@ iled to date from Twitter , or that he has no concrete evidence , or that he sold it in the past false stra@@ cts and she calls it in the past .
Tru@@ mp read the article and began to talk about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
in addition , Gold@@ macher is added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage a paper and document the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
what has the folding ?
Kelly is trying to do three months later , the same thing .
perhaps it will prove as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still very im@@ pul@@ sive self , and its adviser are still stri@@ ving to influence .
these un@@ modified factors make Win@@ ys mission is very difficult .

Bir@@ k@@ enhof is forest hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise becomes the forest hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house located at the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
this is good news for the city .
because with the closing of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then @-@ setting company gesellschaft mbH has lost some 30 000 nights per year and also revenues by local tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of the numbers of refugees who came to the district , the hotel building was offered as a trading accommodation as a trading accommodation , which made public for controversial discussions .
the city passed the accommodation of Asyl@@ um through the list of a building planning to secure the area as a hotel site .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time .
but above all , Freuden@@ stadt Ober@@ bourgeois de Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel site and said then , at the time of ern@@ ing interested parties in the house .
he should keep right to keep right .
Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof near a voluntary increase in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name of Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
get hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in front of the entrance , construction containers has been in front of the entrance , and if you encounter the building , it is clearly under@@ stand@@ alone , as well as extensive renovation work .
the floors have been torn , ceilings , partly disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still lot to do .
&quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
all in the Black @-@ Art Nouveau style will be renewed .
the rooms are fitted with large walk @-@ in showers , the input range is converted , there will be new window .
all that it later &quot; nice p@@ etty &quot; will be close to as Thomas Sch@@ erer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
the facilities and meeting room are among the equipment .
not at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , there is already a high @-@ level downtown , emphas@@ ised Sh@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms is to be discussed under the sh@@ aver .
both single vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people are to be comfortable in the hotel .
discussions with OB Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism director Michael K@@ rau@@ se have already led , so sh@@ aver .
the ideas of the city are covered with those of the hotel group .
we are on the same line . &quot;
after the height of the investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer is not exactly adapted to the amount of investments .
in almost one million euros , he will be charged .
even the outer installations are brought to front , that is already clearly visible .

Russia @-@ Aff@@ aries : U.S. Special Editions - Grand Jury .
in the Russia Aff@@ ect by U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is to be held by Robert Mu@@ eller to a report as a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
in recent weeks , the team have taken the work recorded in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal , &quot; under vocation with the matter of confi@@ dential persons .
the newspaper was the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded his investigations and intensi@@ fied his investigation .
the station CNN reported , it is the first official inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ um agreement with a meeting between the Tru@@ mps the el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
US secret services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin since longer , targeted at the presidential elections in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller is investigated , whether it was explained between Tru@@ mps and Moscow between the Tru@@ mps and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations , several men will stand out during the election campaign as an advisor to the Repub@@ lic@@ ers .
according to reports Mu@@ eller also participated more and more Tru@@ mps private and business environment among the Lup@@ e .
a couple of weeks ago , the Washington Post , wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Forces of Tru@@ mp was placed in the centre and the prevention of understanding , whether he may imp@@ aired the Justice in the wake of the affair .
the key task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to test this evidence in possible tast@@ es and to decide whether the prosecution will be charged .
so , Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore called on counts as well .
mostly , it is switched on if there are larger and controversial cases .
the procedure takes place under closed doors and closed doors .
the panel can also be switched by the Public Prosec@@ ution in order to invite people for the proceedings under E@@ id .
according to the station CNN , CNN were announced pre @-@ inv@@ itations that the meeting between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer is turning .
people who were involved in the meeting were invited to be promp@@ ted to a statement , said it was published in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
beside Tru@@ mp J@@ r. , Tru@@ mps were also Tru@@ mps and son @-@ in @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his right election campaign , Paul Man@@ af@@ ort .
right experts told the Thursday evening in the US television that the action show that Mu@@ eller does not leave in his work , and that he should be necessary to negoti@@ ate if necessary .
however , it must not inev@@ it@@ ating that the Grand Jury will be switched on the end , to decide on the collection of an indictment .
nevertheless , the implementation of the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for establishing Tru@@ mp was for President Tru@@ mp .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday evening a speech in West Virginia used to represent the Russia &apos;s affair as campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; the Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp .
the subject of letters include Dem@@ ok@@ rates have an opportunity to feel good because they can talk anything else that they can speak . &quot;
his special adviser T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in a statement , he says nothing from the one to a Grand Jury .
however , this work is usually produced in the sal@@ ei@@ men that he emphas@@ ised .
the White House presents all measures that accelerated the work of the special program for &quot; f@@ aire &quot; accelerated .
the previous F@@ BI chef James Com@@ ey had said three times , that not against the President .
I have no reason to accept that something else I have changed in the declaration .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used , after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had been fired .
because of this R@@ emo@@ di@@ fs of Tru@@ mp , according to Tru@@ mp , he had to support the justice .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee that Tru@@ mp had asked him to make an attitude of an investigation against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president stands for the investigation under a large pressure .
following a presentation of US media the White House collected the White House Material against the Special Forces and his employees .
the dis@@ b@@ ular spec@@ ulations are released , whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller was released .
unlike the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair known as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , by later , Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller has a position one position , in which theore@@ tically could be fired by the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several transmitters of both parties want to avoid this step .
two groups of republi@@ can and democratic must@@ ators ordered two groups of republi@@ can and democratic must@@ ators , according to which the special er@@ ectile dys@@ function could not be released .

there are no more than 30 years a series of unusual zo@@ di@@ ps in the region , in the region , writes the US Research Center for Snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a fac@@ ture background .

there is a lot of reason why the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ celebrated &apos;s danger exists in danger , because the front edge have never been removed so far as far .
in addition , the iron plate under voltage and could be cr@@ ushed , if there is a piece of a piece .
the melting of sh@@ opp@@ ose and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level , because they swim on the water and swe@@ eping them so much water , as it was due to the melting itself .
however , the loss of the sh@@ ines that means that the glacier can directly flow directly into the sea and much faster than before .
however , this could increase the sea level , however , only in a small dimensions , the British research project in observation of the observation of Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ vel@@ s is the fourth largest sh@@ utter in the Ant@@ arc@@ tica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , front of the front edge to the free ocean from around 200 meters .
there regularly breaks regularly .
although there is an natural look , and we have a direct link to climate change , the iron plate is now available in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
it is the most popular retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed .
it is controversial , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ strom and may go back again , and may be summ@@ arized , &quot; said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man , &quot; said : &quot; our models tell that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this trend will last for decades .
even if this researcher did not lead to climate change , which have not lead to climate change , so in the past decades , there are very many ic@@ ol@@ ines of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
this long bricks of Ant@@ arc@@ tica lies in the direction of South America .
according to data for the research programme British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres in the 1950s .
the decrease of temperature increase was contributed to the decline .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula have passed by around 3 degrees Celsius in the last 50 years and thus counting the areas where the temperature was fastest in the fastest growing .
CDU wants Hau@@ st@@ arif at staff
because it is always difficult to defeat that in mind , the CDU , to appear from the working association to play more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the chal@@ k Day was reduced to 41 new positions in administration .
more than 1100 employees and personnel work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now , 17 trainees began their first working day behind .
the appren@@ tices at circle are obviously very sought @-@ after .
around 620 applications were taken for the last year in this year .
nevertheless , it is missing on the circle of staff to handle the higher demands and tasks .
currently , there are currently no apparent in circle M@@ ett@@ mann in the circle of M@@ ett@@ mann as before 50 .
for example , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration .
if the CDU , CDU wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG as well as the expert @-@ strength training at the management team .
after the wish of the parties , the management is to work on the number of personnel and human development work . &quot;
the aim is to meet not only short @-@ term needs to be cover , but also to the application of the application button , it means that .
the overall concept should be inside and outside orient@@ able , concrete measures for trans@@ verse @-@ star@@ ters and include a training offensive , we challenge CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
after having a good approach after a good start .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems , which you don &apos;t know earlier .
other cities are good public officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the address is given by a regular &quot; contest &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
in addition , a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ out of the service will reti@@ re from the service .
thus , the best time for action , so that no longer remain un@@ locked .
however , Klaus @-@ Dieter &apos;s , leader of the CDU , goes beyond the joint request with his party .
he was in@@ long already in the role for a f@@ au@@ ster@@ ly surprise , when he was the number of personnel in question , and the remaining parties had been stag@@ gering .
peoples would like to be checked , that all the possibilities will be checked out of the municipal working association .
in case , &quot; if we don &apos;t come to an un@@ edited solution , the district administration should be set with trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the circular cities - a skin rate .
this is trying to pay the CDU , the employees and the officials to pay better than it &apos;s the tari@@ ff for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently prescribed , explan@@ ations or more money there is only if one change in a higher level , changes in professional years .
but the tasks of the circle are always grown in past years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up new rooms in which they take care of the provisions of the new development policy .
not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little personnel .
Italy says the sound to the NGO Mig@@ ran@@ ts @-@ rescue in Italy .
Italy , NGOs , the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they will not continue to continue , if they are not allowed to keep new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs does not write a new Code of conduct , it &apos;s difficult to see how they can work on &quot; the Interior Minister Marco Min@@ n@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had found a boat to the German charity organization &apos; Youth rescue et &apos; , because their team had worked together with human tra@@ ders in a way that the illegal deposits took over .
the relief organisation , which has been in operation since one year in operation since one year it is turned into exec@@ utions of the Italian prosecutor Ambro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
for us , the salvation of the human life will be our top priority . so we are very tired that we are working in the search and rescue zone , &quot; said the organisation in a opinion on the social media . &quot;
&quot; we can disc@@ lose any issues that are currently collected only , after having collected all information gathered and the situation was assess . &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat from &apos; Youth rescue et &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , has been monitored since October .
it is believed that his crew will be delivered on board to board their crew . it can be delivered directly from human tra@@ ders , so that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used again , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such endow@@ ment re@@ union was allegedly held only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the Prosecutor of the prosecutor , whose contents of Italian media has been published .
the occupation is suspected of suspected , about the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue essays in zone of humanitarian grounds , and not from any other fashion .
like the Code of Conduc@@ t , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have a Italian police officer to have their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and life@@ times are involved , have now been declared to hold the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules had been necessary , but acceptable , because they would not be &quot; major changes or disabilities &quot; their life@@ times . &quot;
among those who like to sign themselves , the Nobel prize @-@ winner of the doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ n@@ iti said that the number of migrants , declined to the rescue measures to Italy in the last week that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastal waters and the cooperation with the local nature of the fruits .
in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnels , &quot; said the Minister .
he gave plans for further discussions with Libyan civil engineering in this month over economic development initiatives and with Tsch@@ ad , Niger and Mali over measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .

the accommodation in the juni@@ or@@ heimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the castle and W@@ einf@@ est by juni@@ en@@ heim was an additional cost .
the first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards of the Micha@@ el@@ ic@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed the lookout points , partly in towers , of which you could look far beyond the Pf@@ al@@ zer forest and the pre @-@ bearing levels .

console instead of lawn and Bundes@@ liga , are suitable for E @-@ Sport .
the Sport @-@ Stars will sit in future , instead of computer , rather than with wind and weather on the Sta@@ di@@ on@@ ras@@ en ?
fact is : E @-@ Sport has long been a serious industry in a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - large stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high speeds .
this also recognized the first Federal lig@@ aver@@ a , which increasingly committed in this area .
the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , followed by the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and most recently the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , which established a e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July , and two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
we hope to insp@@ ire this new young target groups for V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says the Board of Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
it is safe , &quot; that a train could rise again . &quot;
this coming weekend the Football World Cup organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in London to compete for the gam@@ ers of various clubs .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven are qualified .
also Robin Dut@@ t looks big potential in the E @-@ sport .
the Ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen , has now made a agency for virtual football players .
the real football must be in particular in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds among the young people , even in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : a tried to take all possible markets , to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian .
the most prominent e @-@ sport@@ s@@ men among the contract could be present online on these markets , when only once a year later , as only once a year , the federal government could be sent to Asia .
what &apos;s it exactly ?
with the E @-@ sport computer games such as &quot; League Of Leg@@ ends , &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the football simulation to the competition level .

and with Asia &apos;s 2022 , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official programme .
but it &apos;s a real sports car ?
for many , the performance is safe .
Ingo F@@ rob@@ ber has also been recorded long with the question .
for the professor at the German sports centre in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport , because he is highly biological and physical reactions that are also found in classic Sport - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
moreover there are co@@ gni@@ tive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response .
professional gam@@ ers should not only train to the console but also exercise their body and to the nutrition .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player &quot; . &quot;
but f@@ rob@@ ous looks like problems : &quot; D@@ oping is always a theme &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot;
controls are difficult to handle in online games , and in the scene missing the structures of classical sport .
the scientists have a positive impact on the high @-@ integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
the players are internationally @-@ on @-@ way , that is like a great global family , as there is no intercultural obst@@ acles .
a study of the business consultancy firm Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the E @-@ Sport - a rapid growth in advance .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing , and great tournaments .
in three years , sales of 130 million will lie around 130 million .
against the just 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundes@@ liga , this is little bit .
however , the e @-@ sport is not far away from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte Hotel .
international are many countries already .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez are participating at the US Team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ to@@ Kut@@ cher is investing in the e@@ Sports competition Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe some time .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ sport has been introduced as a class@@ room , &quot; says F@@ rob@@ atic .
in the Netherlands and France , the football @-@ hand @-@ league @-@ makers are now obliged to establish an e @-@ sport branch .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Managing Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
only in N@@ ost@@ algia to fall short , and the old times are clari@@ fy , but not far from today .
it is therefore to preserve the tradition of the association , but the company at the same time set up the modern market at the same time .
we live in a digi@@ tised world , &quot; we also said Dut@@ t . &quot;
&quot; since it is possible to remember that only at the football of football , as it was always . &quot;

there is also a small Z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , transfers the d@@ warf , and at very dry weather there is very many of them . &quot;
and it stands a lot on the game .
la@@ ven@@ del@@ öl is not only enough for holiday@@ makers , it is also for par@@ affin and Cos@@ me@@ tics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant species with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , sub@@ stitution and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have fewer parts with a thermal oil . &quot;
solutions that are drawn into account , are a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration of the ground , but also the spray of the plants with a protective mixture of tone and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dry resistant .

the assassination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
a staff of the weekly magazine Ri@@ odo@@ ce will take part in order to verify their plans for the reporting on the youngest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a , organised by the organized crime , cor@@ rupt officials and un@@ dec@@ lining drug wars .
but on this day , in the shadow of its own trage@@ dy , they came together to speak about security .
it was informed that it is important to change their routine .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more feel : they should take their children with the office , who were to leave the goal of a attack on gr@@ en@@ ades , or at home .
security experts have three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutral , associations .
they ask the re@@ por@@ ter , name for each column - no proof is necessary , per@@ cep@@ tions and abdominal .
there are drug p@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected , on the secret of the government or the Kart@@ elle , a catalogue of crimin@@ als , who make the chaos of Mexico .
there are no representation of violence , throughout all the country , and throughout the country the bodies were driven by President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ eto in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are standing following attacks and thre@@ ats under Bundes@@ schutz und until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries .
under the last one , her publisher and their inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder of Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as , co @-@ founder of Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
the biggest error is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez , in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs .
his place is highly recommended , although its presence is present - a big photo of Val@@ dez , who love his middle with the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porter at the Ri@@ ami@@ rez &apos;s façade , carry T @-@ Shirts , the face of his face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and re@@ por@@ ters discuss their divided themes , the grape of grape , ins@@ om@@ nia , ins@@ om@@ nia , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ an@@ oi@@ a .
even though 2010 , a Son@@ der At@@ tor@@ ney &apos;s Office was established to work with the cases of journalists , according to the committee for the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of Mor@@ den , who are associated with drug trading and organised crime are associated , the mort@@ ar of journalists is only rare before court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they are still not considered to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although it is un@@ tr@@ un@@ ces , even though the terrain is still hes@@ itation .
without any information about mort@@ ar , without justice , has a meeting about the discussion of safety , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very du@@ mm@@ y , my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the War@@ um , we do not know any . &quot;
in the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks away , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men before his car was forced to wait for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - the &quot; twelve &quot; river . &quot;
the scar@@ ves in its car is gone and damaged in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors , rum@@ ors , in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an are free to fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there are practically nothing as silence .
for Gu@@ z@@ mans , last year and extradition to the United States in January and extradition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the whole blood fields of the country because ri@@ val@@ ed Fra@@ tions are struggl@@ ing to fill the vacuum .
it makes nothing that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people on the road are shot , or that the cemetery full is fully decorated , two @-@ story @-@ story mouse @-@ ol@@ een in the drug , which are bigger than many houses for the living .
for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility , &quot; If only a cart@@ on the control of the state of governmental organisation with its valuable har@@ bours and drugs in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of his work , Is@@ ak Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , who is broken with the debt of the blood that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two abuse have contributed to the murder of murder .
initially in February the publication of a interviews with Dam@@ as@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader in one of the ri@@ val@@ ed cart@@ on tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this publication may have troub@@ led to the sons , said the gang@@ members purchased every copy of the edition , once they delivered on newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second mistake had not to become Val@@ dez , in Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of a other newspaper , the same history , the country had to leave the country at his own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its murder is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long survived , that his friends , and colleagues , that he would always be since .
he was in 2003 as a experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este when he joined Ri@@ odo@@ ce with five colleagues in the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold more than 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism , without having to hit the low @-@ po@@ ison problem , &quot; said Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
with the time , the newspaper served a reputation of the mu@@ te and honest reporting , and revenues and advertising .
re@@ porter that thri@@ lled , hard to publish some fear in c@@ ens@@ orship , and the reader were fascin@@ ated by a publication , in which they could read stories , the nobody could handle any less .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Mary @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Award &apos; of the Committee of journalists for his courage in prosec@@ uting the Mexican drug history , where she also led them .
he gave himself up voluntarily to that he had fear .
&quot; I want to live on &quot; I wanted to live at the time of CP@@ J @-@ award .
drug trade in Sin@@ alo@@ a , is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV in October last October .
&quot; you need to take over the task that falls to you as journalist - either or play the Dum@@ a .
I would not want to be asked : &quot; what you did you did in view of many deaths ... why hast thou hast taken what you went ? &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team measures Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird that could happen like a do@@ ck@@ workers , a friend , which was gener@@ ously up , was a teacher who knew what man survived .
you trusted and trusted upon their routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always be to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , go there and always at the same table .
now ask them : was his love to routine use ?
his death , she also forced to ask their own request to question their own request , as they can do their work on life and life at the life .
&quot; you don &apos;t know if you want to move with her women , their children , their clean shops , their home start and run@@ ways , &quot; in order to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ riding and self @-@ preservation .
with its own inst@@ ink@@ able trust .
if there is wrong , w@@ l away , and away from there .
the trouble , said the Editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; smell is a sense that will be interpreted ... and then it is the thing with Javier . &quot;
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , the old rules , such as he and other states are not in Sin@@ alo@@ a , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which an toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative rou@@ ge , weak institutions and cor@@ rupt government officials at home .
the landscape has changed continuously .
in the room , in which the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for security training , suddenly there was no mobile phones . days previously unknown that Spyware , which is sold exclusively to governments , is used for monitoring of journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside they looked for two polic@@ emen protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a construction .
they were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a mid @-@ size district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in sh@@ ear , some of the re@@ porter whether these officers are among the 50 percent of polic@@ emen , who does not recognize the governor itself as a trusted .
it is months later , since the re@@ porter that went to the Ber@@ gl@@ are , where the drug policies de facto into account under control .
for the issue of this week Ri@@ odo@@ ce has made three main stories on three main stories .
there was the assassination of the former owner Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the government spending , which concentrated on the home of the governor of the Govern@@ ors .
there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , an block away from the office of the state , an ab@@ duction .
there was no official word about how it was kidn@@ apped , or how it was to write the particular caution than it was time to write what every one in the city knows that the restaurant is a favourite locally of drug tra@@ ders and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned about public records that the restaurant under the name of a political player has been registered under the name of a political revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which reigned almost all political levels .
several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were adopted several PR@@ I govern@@ ors for high @-@ quality cases of corruption .
in Vill@@ ar@@ real , Vill@@ ar@@ real , re@@ por@@ ters , about predic@@ tions in this locality are writing , among them one , in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went to a military attack .
only a few months previously , the reader were awarded by Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; earlier we saw already that happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El FLACO . &quot; due to its slender body .
all channels of the communication with our sources are broken by now . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers , which is dedicated to the Mor@@ de of journalists , because the employees have become something that they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez Sn@@ app@@ ended a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of a further journalists to the Office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and civil servants , based on DNA tests that it is of it .
in the whole country , journalists has become stronger , by taking part in the Pro@@ test &quot; S@@ OS Press , &quot; due to and constructions .
on this day , the director of Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez weg in Washington is trying to collect international support for the Justice in the fall of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the Governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez acc@@ using the authorities , asked journalists and bring them to bring them because they said the truth .
she has been asked since then that it is re@@ divided by the government , because it is wor@@ ried that their anger is viol@@ ated their lens .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico of organised crime committed to the government officials and the same society . &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote , re@@ por@@ ters not only killed by drug policies , but also on the order of political parties and security forces , which organized a organized crime under a ceiling .
according to the media group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; the media group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; last year more than half of the attacks were assigned to the police and officials .
in Mexico face , because she would like to know that you have the mouth conditions , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez .
apparently , Mor@@ de has obviously a terrible effect .
no one came to the death of the B@@ log@@ ist Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ se before six years ago .
your body was found together with a note that was reportedly signed by the Z@@ etas cartridge : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones are besides her with separate heads .
some branches have chosen as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , after the assassination of Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others , like it El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z addressed the drug pap@@ al with a leading articles on the front page with the heading &quot; What would you like to take us ? &quot;
some journalists are fled from their home or even out of the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and seek to dan@@ gers .
and sometimes they are going to wait until the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was assassin@@ ated along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , after three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who return to work and continue work , it is a daily dance with risk @-@ risk decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once he wanted to be po@@ ets , gives the drug that re@@ ckt it .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I was re@@ porter , &quot; he said .
around midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editorial team of Ri@@ odo@@ ce was on the pav@@ ement before the office and d@@ rank beer , as at once all their phones started .
a series of paintings with band@@ en@@ riv@@ als and security forces near the town of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left the dead in 19 .
the war broke out , as it was promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
they released the news on the site of Ri@@ odo@@ ce about mobile phone on the site of Ri@@ odo@@ ce .
the title page had to be changed on the next day .
si@@ ren@@ s , si@@ ren@@ s near to - a further sliding doors in the area .
Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , threw a view of the polic@@ emen who held the guard to see whether they were in read@@ iness .
if they had not fear at all , they showed it not .
under the massive portrait of the fallen of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose mid@@ finger was visible in Sin@@ alo@@ a , followed by the collabor@@ ators of Ri@@ odo@@ ce his tracks .
as you can also do you think about it , &quot; said Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; when the same day , to be murdered by Javier , the practitioners for me to send me to the road . &quot;
the Din@@ osau@@ rs is used to use Din@@ osau@@ rs in Tar@@ ok to make his delic@@ acy
at the first glance , it looks like a statue , if a fri@@ gh@@ tly .
now researchers found that the first findings of the incredible Nash@@ or@@ ns was so well received , that experts have described as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa by Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even be discovered that its white skin of red@@ dish Braun was told - and they said , she would have had something of a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
the report in the magazine &quot; Design Biology &quot; was found him as &quot; the be@@ ster@@ min@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs , which was ever found and one of the best Din@@ osau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot;
the ossi@@ l is a newly discovered type of N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs , who lived in the middle of chal@@ k times between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his unbeliev@@ ably good original condition has researchers who had it as a really remarkable &quot; describe and aston@@ ishing .
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ge@@ aring plant was the best preserved F@@ ossi@@ l of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn funk when he was on 21 March 2011 in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray , in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something like what happened from the surrounding rocks at the Plat@@ ze , and decided to take more accurate .
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years , the wild animal within the 2,500 Po@@ und ( 1,100 kg ) heavy @-@ proof st@@ ables .
after all of these hard work , the ready result is ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only have a little familiar with the eyes @-@ blind , you could not believe that it is , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the cre@@ ature is depicted .
science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs individuals - Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ osau@@ rs is one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs individuals . &quot;
researchers have found that this plant was covered , although it is similar to a stirring , and is similar to a convertible tank , probably from the flesh , and threatened by meat .
the strongly ge@@ p@@ anz@@ ed Din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ st to hide himself , and used a par@@ atro@@ technique which is known as counterpart , that is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been better to mix better in his surroundings and his delic@@ acy , say experts , what indicates that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old cre@@ ature made from the N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs family made the head@@ lines in May for the first time and is now shown at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have studied wild animal and studying Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing maintenance of the specimen came to Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , the patterns and the form of p@@ olls and arm@@ aments over his body .
they discovered the conc@@ essions , an important defence method in the animal , which means that the top of the cre@@ ature is dark@@ er than their under@@ side .
although the conc@@ ession is usual , the results are surprisingly , since the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta are by far the amount of living animals .
it indicates that the Din@@ osau@@ rs was sufficient to lack of sufficient pressure by meat and send Din@@ osau@@ rs . evolution , the evolution of the confron@@ tation was fav@@ ored as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals , who are to go to R@@ PM , Zeb@@ ul , or Gür@@ tel@@ e@@ als - are much smaller and viol@@ ate as prey source , which was exposed to a real struggle against that N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs was exposed to a real struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; strong smoking behaviour in a massive , strongly ge@@ aring din@@ osau@@ rs , how to have been dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs of the chal@@ k @-@ animals to have been &quot; said Brown &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their sc@@ alen shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r is rot@@ ated .
scientists continue to examine the animal on information about his life , including its con@@ serving fourth Dar@@ min@@ ent , to figure out what it was eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the Din@@ osau@@ rs is , when he died , into a river and in the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea .
on this time , Alberta was as warm as south fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much more landscape than they are today .
&quot; this N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs is really remarkable because it is completely covered with con@@ spic@@ uous skin for it , but also in three dimensions , the original form of the Shel@@ ter , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; the result is that the animal today looks like in the early C@@ ret@@ a time .
you don &apos;t need a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only have a little bit with the eyes , you could believe that it is at bed@@ time . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when a huge Ther@@ op@@ ods , succ@@ essively send Din@@ osau@@ rs , which went on two legs to turn the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ r Rex , died million years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , was the ge@@ ared Din@@ osau@@ rs in some of his fur@@ mit@@ er ancestors .
this is the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ r , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
scientists who appear to be the latest findings in the journal @-@ Biology magazine , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta believe in the sea and burnt down in the mud .
the cre@@ ature was found by Sha@@ wn funk when he was on 21 March 2011 in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray , in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum , it is the preserved din@@ osau@@ rs in the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is completely covered by the Schn@@ au@@ ze to the hip .
the creatures , on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that were added by its shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ge@@ aring plant was w@@ ed by the Western Canada , until a flo@@ oded river in the open sea .
however , the underwater facilities of the Din@@ osau@@ r is protected against an exquisite detail in an exquisite detail .
at least the rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well received that the skin &apos;s still climbing up to the din@@ osau@@ r plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko for National Ge@@ ographic , such a such level of conservation is such as a profit in Lot@@ to .
if more I see it , the cur@@ sor is it .
if the remains of the skin still cover the hol@@ pri@@ ons tank , which carry the sk@@ ull of the animals .
his re@@ chter front is located on his side , his five finger is at top of the top .
I can count the d@@ olls on its sole . &quot;
in th@@ under@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ aram@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many wounded
violent accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are wrapped in a massage aram@@ bol@@ i .
there are numerous verses , kilometers long st@@ aff@@ s and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the Autobahn Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) on the late Thursday evening , there were approximately 20 people at the late Thursday morning .
after the first data of the police against 17.00 o &apos;clock between the inter@@ connection of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , during a Ge@@ wit@@ ters under 30 vehicles , including direct lor@@ ry , in@@ forming .
above the exact number of the last had no data .
the person in the course of light to moderate injuries , said a police pre@@ mat@@ cher .
a large number of rescue vehicles was on the accident .
the A8 was completely locked towards Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a roughly ten kilometres of leng@@ th@@ ein@@ au was formed .
as an AZ por@@ ters reported , it was also reported on the counterpart to massive disability - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the Fire Army , which is listed on the vehicle &apos;s body , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. , there was a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a coll@@ ision of a coll@@ ision between a car sports and a car .

Deutsche Bahn : Group test@@ et &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost every one has experienced : nothing that is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant idea .
and then buff@@ f .
the work comes from the work and ki@@ cks a uns@@ hi@@ ft or set the passenger center in the workflow .
driving control .
but the times of the inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon past .
the Deutsche Bahn test@@ et currently under@@ way the hard drive control .
one confirms simply by phone that one can be taken by his place and does the travel card .
at present , a test run is at two distances .
we offer the offer to a wide range of products .
then , at the beginning of the next year , it will be available for many further remote routes in Germany , &quot; said a train speaker .
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; calls the ticket of the ticket evaluation without work .
however , to use this , however , some requirements are fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to booked an online ticket - what should already do most passengers do .
you must also have purchased the app of the train , the DB Navigator , which is the comfortable kind of the ticket sales .
and last , you need a seating set .
because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works as : you rises in the train , call his driver &apos;s ticket under &quot; M@@ eine tickets . &quot;
when the test customers appears to be a button for the testing time .
the train managers get a message on their mobile devices a message that passenger is located in the train and the ge@@ booked seats in Y .
coming from the train guide , the train head is at number Y knows that there is a passenger online ticket with an online ticket .
so you can sleep to sleep , further , further , further .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , use one for the train - what to the passengers take advantage of the passengers .
&quot; those who want to travel without a ticket control through our train staff , I am simply feel free in the DB Navigator .
this enables the passengers to make your travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing @-@ Management of DB remote traffic .
second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to enter individual customer needs . &quot;
those often take train , knows that in addition to delay and missed trains to the largest doctors , are among the greatest doctors .
for often , however , if one of the check @-@ out did not work any documents that you need to use the online tickets for the use of online tickets .
either the credit card or the number of reference clock or otherwise a document that you must show .
the result is endless discussions between train managers and passenger , which leads to worse on worse and del@@ ays in the control of your own tickets and the work at the end time , to take care of other forms .
even only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this is only available on the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked .
as an activ@@ ist , the answer came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken by its core .
only one day after they arrived in New York City , the church was sitting in St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene on the bed of a Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , that they rented and sc@@ roll through Facebook on their phone .
you are proud about a post of somebody from the High School .
the police has just killed an 18 year old child , and there is still on the road &quot; called it there .
confused , since no one didn &apos;t know anything else on your Fe@@ ed , the information received Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was continually updated continuously on their tim@@ eline .
the R@@ apper , from the territory of St. Louis , was the death of Michael Brown , an armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live too .
he post@@ ete a picture by Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body , which was punched out on the road and would stay four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s a wild , &quot; thought of Fer@@ rell . &quot;
but the death was nothing new for them and her community nothing new .
it put your cell phone in order to return on the evening to Twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos from the police band and people , and out of a man who claimed to be his sign , to be a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police had just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live Fe@@ ed , where a polic@@ eman , in front of a group of protest@@ ers with a bell@@ ishing dog .
in another video , she told them , a other polic@@ eman , and cried : &quot; I will kill you ... &quot; animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; that Fer@@ rell went to her statement .
this is not the species of murder , to which we call us and that we call for us . &quot;
this moment I felt Schüt@@ tel@@ a .
I was angry and we@@ eping . &quot;
you book a return flight and went home to the next day after home .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from their father &apos;s house and decided that the two next morning would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss of resistance , strength and strength of resistance , which consists of people from the point of people who live in the community and the roads have to challenge answers .
as a he@@ rell with her daughter , who had an Flower and a matching crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two was a conversation , that they had countless times in front of this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; You know that , as I taught you , when black people have to fight for the fight , what they believe in ? &quot; remin@@ ded it of what they said . &quot;
now we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year old boy , and that was not right .
I couldn &apos;t take it to take it , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
what happened today , is a high point of its ... what happened in the past .
you need to know it and be it in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we do have to do so free to liber@@ ate ourselves .
even though I have experienced the luck to give you a experience that personally did not experienced a ek@@ lat@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is not different as the next black female child .
I have the feeling , I would give you a bad service , they keep them away . &quot;
the first station when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Road , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place compared to the police station , which became a camp on the potential of the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there have been Fer@@ rell and her daughter together with a local business partner , the lunch made .
you have prepared bags and mix them to protest@@ ers .
slowly it started to accept a new kind of activity for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
after August 9 , total , &quot; my activ@@ ism have changed , &quot; said they said that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ souri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Association of Nur@@ ses Association and focused on Food and Health in black municipalities .
I had no experience in the organis@@ er .
it has come to all . &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rell met Fer@@ rell during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the movie .
fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her Camera Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to document the &quot; documentary &quot; what happened .
a question came to the sense : &quot; want to document the document or trying to find a story that you can use it ? &quot;
this Sk@@ ep@@ sis was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from White - in a community which benef@@ ited from their pain and its resistance .
as fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared in an interview : &quot; we heard that people who are born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and grew up and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it different . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , a artist from the area that is known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ ct occup@@ ations .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rell &apos;s project , together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years to Brow@@ ns .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main reason for me , as these people are represented , because the people will be represented . &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on fer@@ mented experience - in order to show that it is not a Messiah guide , but in order to become a community , &quot; said fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the obvious participants in the film .
as a result , the documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of fer@@ es life , as they loves to mar@@ ches their wife .
I felt like the naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and l@@ apping when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; but I understand that there was a certain damage to be found in this work and for the human being of black people . &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ re@@ alizes is repeated the role of black pregnant women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which according to the execution of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 was min@@ ted the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in 2012 , identi@@ fies as pregnant as pregnant .
black , pregnant with women in manag@@ erial positions have carried out the movement , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we fight it constantly on various fron@@ ts .
black , pregnant coil women must have to carry the main last of all . &quot;
fol@@ ay@@ an voted to notice that &quot; the movement really kept really fine of black women and many black women . &quot;
however , it is insist@@ ed that &quot; this is no in@@ compatible type of action , &quot; at Fer@@ rell was chosen as a heart of the film .
&quot; she was the person who made these energy , &quot; said it . &quot;
it &apos;s no co@@ incidence , although it was at pre @-@ front front , as a black , pregnant with woman so much on the game .
you can pick up their energy by the screen . &quot;
meanwhile the news release of F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has been gone long , but the ra@@ cial connections between the community and police are still rising .
Fer@@ rell is located in currency , for 2 ½ years because of block@@ age of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area , which she calls her home : &quot; a Chaos &quot; . &quot;
nevertheless they had to perform a singing and they feels committed to this memory , since then they went on the road three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; it is our requirement to fight for our freedom .
it is our user to win .
we need to love one another and support other .
we have nothing to lose anything - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; size &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; size : &quot; TV @-@ reader &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bit gallery moves the people , although it is not built for long .
but the idea of a shopping center on the south of the pedestrian prec@@ inc@@ t since the first presentation 2009 the population is in support and opponents .
the theme has hardly one .
the subject will also be discussed at the &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; Facebook page . &quot;
during one @-@ bit gallery : &quot; this would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; This would be a dream &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , coming from the other side : &quot; we don &apos;t need any man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ right ) or simply &apos;s simple : &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the advoc@@ ate in advoc@@ ates that a gallery attracts more customers in the city , of which the other business profit also benefit , that the pedestrian prec@@ ur@@ ges of the pedestrian zone could benefit .
in addition , the gallery is planned to offer exactly on the premises , on which the peasant market hall is to offer their products in 13 directors .
at the beginning of the construction works there will be a conclusion .
the Galerie M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - precisely to the Bed@@ a square with possibility to seats outside the seats .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we buy now for almost a week in the farmer &apos;s market hall for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the Blessed Virgin are always liked very happy .
we have discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
we would like to wish that , during , and above all after the construction of the gallery , there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also the same .
the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ensing : &quot; whether directors is market for market in a Mark@@ thalle in the gallery , arrives at the height of the rental .
the new project probably should not be too low for the new project .
Eva Ki@@ lic : &quot; the shopping centre in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dr@@ au@@ ties or supermarkets : I find the su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is already enough to us in our city .
one sees how many cargo shops can be empty here - some since months and years .
but there is not even a ordinary weekly market , there are all the more important to get to the market hall at least the market hall .
because anyway , the product is made of fresh , mostly directly from the producers , and is purely inexpensive .
as you can see , shop stores in a shopping mall will be rented solely of larger companies , because they are not portable for a single dealer often not portable .
sch@@ ade , special shops , there are almost no longer and that of which is still left , then will disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a mall with a Mark@@ thalle fits all together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the peasant market hall during the construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ KA would be the solution - even on duration if the Bit Gallery is actually coming out sometime .
or if it creates the Ges@@ pen@@ st @-@ Gallery , all stores from Bit@@ burg will be able to distribute all shops in Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this is simply not work .
and a shopping center , which stands empty , no one needs no one .
in my view , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery .
but it is necessary for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the amazing many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg there is no place .
if the farm market hall is made , we will disappear again a piece of culture . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the smoking of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces of faces - white , black and brown , which hanging itself almost invisible - the ceiling of the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Haar@@ lem that you have been sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from prison by Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth where the former secret services analy@@ ser had a 35 @-@ year prison sentence , after she made public diplomatic messages via the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming Res@@ ur@@ ry ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline took its competence in technology , computer science and art , and she was the condem@@ nation of Barack Obama , was called by Barack Obama , when he was only three days in his position .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated out through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which could look like someone with these geno@@ mic DNA data - the many ways to be interpreted as they can be interpreted as they are interpreted , and the inherent Det@@ er@@ min@@ ism of this interpre@@ tations - but also to the identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward born , but has been found guilty of his buffer : for the identification of his death , he was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for 20 trials , including six pieces against the spi@@ on@@ age Act , computer was and the@@ ft .
by the prison , her image was suppres@@ sed , so that there was only a single photo - a liqu@@ eurs , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in the cre@@ ing is confident of a driver &apos;s seat , and has been associated with which she was associated with them .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came just from the great success of their 2012 @-@ project &apos; beach Visi@@ ons . &quot;
this is the artist portrait of foreign part of arti@@ stry , including cigar@@ ette bl@@ mel and K@@ aug@@ mented , by creating the DNA from the waste , in order to create a picture of which the people could look like these people .
that was the time when they received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
in prison , &quot; she created an interview with Chelsea , and she wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article &quot; declared De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg .
and they could not be visited at this time , and they could not be photographed on Chelsea , so that they wanted to make contact with Chelsea and asked them to make it a DNA portrait .
the artist and incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were inter@@ cep@@ tible to Bri@@ eff@@ er , which had several letters in the course of two years .
they need even a summary of Sho@@ oting Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated comic book &quot; Supp@@ res@@ sed images , &quot; who saw a future predic@@ tion , in which the President of the United States would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was indeed just a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ings release after seven additional years ago in a military prison in Kan@@ sas , was a dramatic kind of good@@ bye to the re@@ union .
there is also a little because in the opening of the exhibition , because Donald Tru@@ mp leads a war against in@@ forman@@ t from the government camp and against trans@@ form@@ att@@ ing troops to find new , to be re @-@ capable to solve the star@@ ters , which he is supposed to be too bad .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , after the strange Tim@@ ing of all these things was asked , she said that &quot; things happen that &quot; things from a certain reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery , the teams called up with their over@@ sized signature , among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name ) an end of &quot; automatic sm@@ ashing principle , whose foundation of sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been &quot;
on the opposite wall , the mit@@ ochondri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As was written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , hop@@ ing through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ de after the highly developed scientific En@@ cyclo@@ pedia of the artist ) how amazing , at least in bi@@ ologically , we all are .
&quot; what people do not take care of things that our gen@@ ome is not responsible for a interpretation and as subj@@ ective data , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , also can be seen .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition that is kept in a separate room , is one side from the top mentioned co@@ mic Nov@@ elle .
she shows Mann@@ ing , as it appears with a release man in the hand of the United States , such as King @-@ Kong .
&quot; if they &apos;re talking your speech , then they won , &quot; means it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; says the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; said the artist that has been living in Philadelphia .
&quot; &quot; I get still to see , if I talk about . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has never seen the exhibition yet - as it was pre@@ valent in the comic book - but if it should do it , then it will be gre@@ eted in the middle of the space of mas@@ ks , from their own gen@@ om@@ atic simulator , which like hormon@@ es are merged with prot@@ agonist .
it was also targeted as everything in the exhibition until the size of the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups had been written with pencil .
in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a human being , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg .
&quot; I wanted to feels like a mass movement that feels like a mass movement that was formed with Chelsea , as the movement that came out behind her liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ - and an employee for the University of Oxford
a nationwide human rights was in the G@@ ange for a professor at the North@@ Star University and a staff of Oxford University , who had sought refuge in a luxurious apartment in Chicago , killing a man in Chicago .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ ws ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued warran@@ ts for murder of their alleged participation in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the Ak@@ ten of the County Court .

War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man for the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are linked to the police in contact with the police in Britain , and ready to help US investigations to any way . &quot;
the statement said that War@@ ren@@ s were sho@@ cked to sho@@ cked his colleagues .
Chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said to meet the susp@@ ects of the susp@@ ects to the authorities .
the police opened an idea of your position , and our efforts to strengthen their efforts , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .

the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement on the residents &apos; : &quot; the police currently works at the time and in the background of the victim and resear@@ ched a variety of mo@@ tives , including a possible human incident . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vice President Mut@@ ko
the Russian leader of Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , it will not last for long until the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) is implemented for restoration of the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
in a certain stage of the criteria of the driver plan , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with Ukrain ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; declared Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the schedule of WA@@ DA to compliance with the code that describes the criteria for the re@@ generation of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he also contains nothing that could give the reason for Russia .
all was announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
however , one of the criteria to be mentioned in the list , however , that the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping authorities have approved the investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard Li@@ ability to alleged co @-@ sponsored D@@ op@@ ings in Russian sports .
in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko : &quot; we lead the investigation by because our anti @-@ D@@ oping system has had an error .
all measures have been implemented .
but there was no government programs , and we are not admit that there is no longer exists . &quot;
Mut@@ kos was accused of accused of having Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales agency R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , S@@ mir@@ nov made the past of the Russian anti @-@ scale organizations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report compiled positions and regulations .
no one has no one to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; says S@@ mir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was released in November 2015 during the D@@ oping @-@ Sk@@ and@@ als of the WA@@ DA by performing D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls in Russia .
however , your tests were allowed to plan and coordinate with the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the organization of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is in the right towards &quot; moves to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help you to help your company not to become the next u@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure your staff at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but they did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful , or worse - troub@@ led .
and even if you don &apos;t have been sad , some workers were not sad .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and lens , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who operates the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Re@@ ed .
it has people on the outside of the outside .
a new race of the Human Resources Start @-@ ups is to help businesses to help businesses as their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measurement of staff commitment , it allows companies to provide specialist groups and demographic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allow C @-@ Suite managers to have to be sent directly to the Board of Directors .
they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ cute , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics of companies is used to measure employees .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she won a better view into what does your collabor@@ ators and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it provides a heat map of the company that have a look at which units have the most common condition and what managers have low cost results - such that you can understand why .
companies do not come to stay that at the top of the workplace culture , don &apos;t have to be confused , then a former employee has been published a blog post , which describes a life of Belgian law , with those who have spoken to those who have spoken .
for Start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business design .
the Global Governance , Regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18,@@ 7 billion worth 2020 , after the final technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up convert dv@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behaviour , and saw a reduction of interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the u@@ ber F@@ alles .
convert dv@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a Kli@@ ent .
like G@@ lin@@ t , convert Conver@@ t @-@ to @-@ customized &quot; pulse , &quot; send a trusted answer in real time , and see the heat maps of your problem .
it also offers an anonymous SMS @-@ Hot@@ line , with the employees of bad behaviour .
and if the main managing guide is related to the Supervisory Board , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the Court of public opinion has been recorded by Reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ t .
if a company is found that his staff is poor , or eth@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience extensive consequences by consumers boy@@ cot@@ t , workers of workers and Kl@@ ages , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has convert dv@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that staff members of the politics and methods are to achieve an easy way to achieve its corporate headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted to call a problem , he had to be able to find a number or e @-@ mail to the company &apos;s headquarters , a formal appeal and hope to put it .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints of employees .
now , since the company convert dv@@ cent , problems , which were hidden by leadership , who were related to offices in cities or states , have been hidden like discrimination , bel@@ gi@@ ants or un@@ parall@@ eled practitioners .
it is closer to this hol@@ istic , 360 @-@ degree view of the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; and we protect our shareholders before employment and law . &quot;
company started to take Eth@@ ics , Eth@@ ics and employee involvement in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen broke out due to the En@@ ron @-@ Sk@@ ill , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
but it lasted until the &quot; Social Media at their right , &quot; the company suggests that they could not prevent the dirty bur@@ ial online .
&quot; before the use of technology on the monitoring of eth@@ ics , the man used more than a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t as well as converting your software as a service , and the companies with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to join the agreement of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors who supported both start @-@ ups .
converting $ 10 million was raised in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , which was raised the whole capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured a $ 10 million in November by Bess@@ emer co and brought its total financing to $ 60 million .
this investment is hardly surprising , in view of the networked nature of companies , culture and Venture Capital .
there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s staff of their jobs are expected to expect more than so far .
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high content and interesting projects only .
the employees want to have the feeling you will be accepted and estimated that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to attend a company , and the work is worth it , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Th@@ ee Experience for Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Conver@@ cent and g@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors reach return , if its portfolio are well run . companies run well , if employees are employed and engaged .
if the analy@@ tics tools is third , commitment and the use of employees , it &apos;s no wonder that you will find support .
the data on the experts of workplace culture are important to experts in workplace culture .
but the data is usable , if the wal@@ ter of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company is preparing for your feedback , it may have a anticip@@ ation that changes on the way is .
and if the change is not fast enough , or at all , this dis@@ appoint@@ ing the dis@@ appoint@@ ments and employees .
if you ask for 4,000 discussions , you have to have ready to have 4.000 discussions , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , the company has settled to have settled on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t know , &quot; you do not follow me , &quot; Have you really heard ?
take care ?
and if you don &apos;t want to take care of why ? &quot;
Madison Editor , which now leads to monthly issues , was able to open action on the same day when a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t .
and when collectors from fru@@ str@@ ated staff , she was able to organize and encourage the quality of communication , able to organize several teams within the company &apos;s work and to add a communications training to tackle the problems .
in Ruby Tuesday , the company receives new insights about the employees , and it hopes that at a long point of view , this is a better link of workers in a branch which is known for high sales .
if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people lose , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you lose also customers .
and if you lose , customers will lose it , then you will lose .
the N@@ CA@@ A features the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the bru@@ ins
it goes on 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A Foot@@ work on one side of the new exercise of the teams can run on the campus .
some have moved their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of silence in the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the teams , this unt@@ aner B is a lunch break .
players who are inscri@@ bed to the summer courses , will return to their final exercise , before they return at 6 : 30 on the next morning at 6 : 30 to the water man Football Center .
that is the next three days a real t@@ act mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a short before the Monday to Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ days exercises to facilitate the burden of the player easier , and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday .
for this reason , the first three training of U@@ CL@@ A at 19 : 15 am should be able to meet the already fully pack@@ ag@@ ings of the players .
the compromise route from the two days is more than a day , where the Bru@@ ins has moved almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time at Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood .
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the start of the formal preparations for their launch against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports the control change of N@@ CA@@ A support , even if they added the much @-@ in routes of the player an additional point .
&quot; we put this enormous load three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
and they didn &apos;t have pressed , they have pl@@ ains it , they are great people .
I think once we come until Saturday and we have more time , it will really great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A is termin@@ ated its practices once the camp has ended , which in view of the clear sight of his squares from a adjacent parking place and the adjoining Lus@@ kin Center , which was subjected to a quiet area which is already filled with foot@@ b@@ fo@@ sts , no easy task is to be done .
Bru@@ ins @-@ Player should be the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a spatial has a problem that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free of season .
we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far away to think that people there is a room for a room and then get there to a exercise .
if you have the video and from a exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best do , with what we have .
I do not make great worry about this .
we have a plan . &quot;

Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fal@@ low messages in fact , and their results under the original set , &quot; said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to combat so called F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in a opinion on his website that it will be used with the use of updated learning methods , to acknow@@ ledge potential folding messages and may be transmitted to the factor of factor from the original articles .
Facebook was cri@@ tici@@ zed as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , of which many believe that they have affected the US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem is also in Europe on a great political topic , whereas the French vot@@ ers were flo@@ oded by the Presi@@ dential elections in May with false stories , and Germany supported a plan to eliminate social media networks , if they are not able to boost water @-@ filled postal ings as before the election there in September quickly .
on Thursday , Facebook is launched in a separate statement at German , that in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts were launched .

create a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squ@@ ee@@ ze @-@ music video and was it for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ 1990 and 1980 @-@ 10 years .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history in the arm@@ l river valley in K@@ ent and now has inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ y Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a love for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript from somebody dead , who is dead for 300 years , &quot; he says we@@ ring . &quot;
&quot; what is a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England is exciting the time from the Middle Ages until the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . any history was revealed by any other , coming British artist Zlat@@ y May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on one archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other St@@ ories &apos; , a collection which was inspired by documents in the British library - a project that he expected un@@ expect@@ edly .
I have written only to the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter which was written by a double @-@ year in the 1700 @-@ th years , who worked for the Jakob@@ iner , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; this is his thum@@ b@@ ying !
and letters were always filled to smoke , because then a fire for light because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect , as he would be even doing .
Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
I want to meet someone with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England , and for nearly four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest ) , I seems to have my welcome pit . &quot; it seems to be nice to be true .
Rho@@ dos spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , the archives and to study many treasures and curi@@ osity of the castle , such as the mon@@ ast@@ eries of the walls and the bottles were spent in gra@@ bs .
he emigr@@ ated through the area and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with Land@@ sc@@ ans , garden@@ er and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he d@@ rank , &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the in@@ time history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received the full access in 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
as the Rho@@ des one decade later , the staff started to take care of the archive to take care of the archive , which he wrote as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ ok@@ es said &quot; Oh , cast it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Em@@ pi@@ res , maps , who possessed what had : &quot; one could happen that the country @-@ conflicts would be bor@@ ing at the age of &quot; but Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
boys , let &apos;s go all his course ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to spread @-@ wide basis in the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , leaving a man who is the newly built castle , to join the farm from 13@@ 81 .
there is a recording of a w@@ rist@@ watch , who joined the castle in 13@@ 80 in the castle , with the title &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des .
the peas@@ antry began in this area and I thought it was a good start .
maybe you are connected to each other ? &quot;
other stories are firmly in the history of the castle , such as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it History , the family was hiding for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , which is represented in the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rell by the 18th century by creating a Sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that was only years later when his Sar@@ g was excav@@ ated ) .
the performers are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the Lor@@ ds seemed to be a sac@@ ral G@@ aun@@ er to spend time and money for things that they were not able to make money for things .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ male imp@@ ly their debt crisis , by keeping rich old women , and I am going to me as a bun@@ ch of young guys , with a talent to work within me . &quot;
after the end of its application in Schloss Rho@@ des to other unique write experience
he has a two @-@ week stay in Finnish game for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mar@@ in@@ ki , on the grounds of a san@@ atorium in the early 20th century , which has been back in nature again .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad , &quot; he says . &quot;
it was like : &quot; Ah , now I must finish again with the dam@@ n life . &quot;
launched in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf : more than 300 Years old Mari@@ ci@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
in the case of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ ön@@ elle , in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city has started their campaign to launch a new roof brand ( round from Thursday ) on Friday .
until Thursday the Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team around Nelson Ar@@ tz hold the logo and the slogan of its slogan .
at the end of August it should be the cli@@ max of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or ? , &quot; the makers of the promotion have been yesterday at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel since yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we think the ( of course ! ) doesn &apos;t really &quot; write it on their yesterday &apos;s un@@ locked website .
&quot; but we will take advantage of this measure to win your attention .
and in order to make it clear that many is better than it seems .
basically we are the fixed conviction that we as a bathroom honey citizen to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
with the action , it gets more than &quot; a logo and a slogan of slogan , so it continues .
&quot; it applies to form@@ ulate an incredible promise to form@@ ulate one that the city is a distinctive unique feature . &quot;
finally , they understand it in the competition with other commun@@ es .
a medium @-@ digit increase is the City of Bad Honnef your new roof brand and the campaign cost .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on Pen@@ sion@@ ings and transports in officer &apos;s cor@@ ps .
this week , even this week .
on the first sight of a normal process .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting did not take more in the building of the General Staff , as previously earlier , but in the office of Prime Minister .
the Consult@@ ations took part in the Consult@@ ations under the chair@@ manship of the government for the five prime minister , as well as the Minister of Defence , Foreign Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
thus the civilians in the Y@@ as were in the number of people .
the government attracts the bre@@ eze in the military .
general staff of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ure of the army , the air force and the Navy were ab@@ sent .
since the failed coup , head of state Erd@@ og@@ an has been fired up to 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and aircraft .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of exile @-@ Pre@@ dig@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as a wi@@ pe of the put@@ ty .
against 4@@ 86 people who have been involved in the coup attempt , it is also been involved in Ankara since that week .
already on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an gave the overthrow of the overthrow of the &quot; divine gift &quot; when he is the opportunity to clean up the armed forces . &quot;
but the Erd@@ og@@ an army is really true in the grip ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; H@@ ür@@ ri@@ ot &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ beh@@ agen &quot; in the military headquarters . &quot;
in the general scale of the letters of the armies , because of a increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which among others , in the repe@@ al of the scal@@ p , wrote for solo viol@@ ets , wrote the newspaper .
the grandfather in the army and security forces is at least in any case .
in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ og@@ an sent another 73@@ 95 state di@@ gest@@ ers , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
there seemed to have been there , as the Erd@@ og@@ an of the military .
the gener@@ als of the country earlier than the actual gent@@ l@@ emen of the country .
three times later , they are under appeal to her role as a watch@@ man of the world state .
after his elect@@ oral victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an appe@@ aled to the power of the military step , not least under appeal to the reform of the European Union .
former officers , Erd@@ og@@ an t@@ rei@@ ves targeted a Islam@@ ist armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a non @-@ called officer that sought after the coup attempt to fear abroad in a few years ago , the Turkish army would be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; in a few years .
this is to be found that the NATO could not be in@@ cold .
moreover , the alliance gives doubt an doub@@ ts in the alliance after the establishment of the Turkish army .
the leadership of the leadership and oper@@ ation@@ abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; , &quot; Nato @-@ diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington change the rules for the Green Card
it will give a new US deposits to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted from the media .
it looks like to reduce the leg@@ al@@ emi@@ grants to 50,000 per year , higher regulations for obtaining a requirement of work permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ ans and supported by the president .
the legislative design should be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and billion dollars for the tax@@ pay@@ ers and will save them by helping the U.S. the way to be issued like the citizens from other countries . &quot;
the law will replace the chains of chains and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will speak to the candidates , which speak English to support the financial funds to support themselves and knowledge that our economy will be good , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quotes from the American media .
the Ministry of Renn@@ es to race in the Ministry of Peace
again in the past few months over the future of the Rac@@ et@@ utt@@ les had been declared - now it should be quite fast .
even before the end of the year , at the mar@@ em@@ itting distance , on which the tourist destination will be built .
this year , in order to safegu@@ ard the future of the race of the Renn@@ es in the long term , should start the construction work on the track in this year .
&quot; with the decision to order the &quot; Ilmenau @-@ race stei@@ g , &quot; this country knows what the country is most important for tourism , &quot; declared traffic @-@ state secretary , Klaus Sü@@ hl , on Friday in Erfurt .
the costs for the repair of the tour measures to about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country over@@ take 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the Shuttle is to be ordered in the future of the country , will be a well @-@ balanced , declared Sü@@ hl .
the Ministry and the South th@@ ür@@ ingen train as operators are spread over the technical details .
&quot; thus the travel plan , the vehicles and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; said Sü@@ hl .
the planned contract between the Ministry and the Bahn@@ gesellschaft will be closed for a duration of eleven years .
thus the racing will be ordered by the Renn@@ g shuttle on December 2017 .
the racing shuttle is a popular railway link between the railway stations of Ilmenau and racing .
in the last months of a pilot installation , the distance of sufficient amounts to be used to order the distance of sufficient many people , to order it back in the future .
the circuit is also strongly dil@@ api@@ dated .
the rise of sex robot is real , and we should worry about worry
just as you thought that it will not be w@@ ack@@ ed by 2017 , a new report is in the technological developments in the field of sex robot .
yes , indeed .
sex @-@ robot are currently a great thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robo@@ tics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robo@@ tics and artificial intelligence at the University She@@ ff@@ ield as well as co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start to start their ascent .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of breast war@@ d@@ ze and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ing .
people who make people talk about it , but the companies deliver a lot of them , and we will get much more often to see how Sh@@ ark@@ ey said to the release of his new report .
modern sin@@ ks have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robot with a silicon con@@ cave that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions , which can be achieved through the artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust his robot also according to his products &quot; and thereby choose from the eye @-@ color of the robot via the form of chest strap up to type or paint of its f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it is still alive because many robots , the &quot; personalities , &quot; who would like to look like a Step@@ ford &apos;s wife .
modern S@@ exports have developed to robot with a silicone con@@ junc@@ tiv@@ a .
the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot allows for example to adapt to its users to adapt its robots to the properties , which they tend to find like for example .
and then there is the true Compani@@ on of the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which brings the impression of rel@@ ent@@ ness and &quot; wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; ab@@ ent@@ age &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality written by your personality as well as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of true Compani@@ on .
so &apos;d like to like what you like , and they do not like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , you also have their voting - quite as real people !
it may seem to be tired to be fixed on the s@@ unk or can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot;
there are many be@@ ati@@ ble aspects during this rise of sex robot - not least because they replace true human relations - but the under@@ ing female properties , however , if one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , Be@@ un@@ quiet one at most .
on his website , True Life on Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibration , why can do not have any Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; says it on the site .
however , these sex robot is not only a fever or maintenance only a different S@@ ex@@ changes .
their formation and their increasing refin@@ ement of our culture , to a retreat on the ideal of the equality of the sex@@ es to a desire after sex with under@@ scores .
most men are of course not all sex @-@ robots , and while the FR@@ R did their rising popularity into the FR@@ R , they still remain a provisional point on the edge of the consumer culture .
but what about the boundary conditions , it can live in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange , except that the free market gives the permission to them .
there is a certain hyper@@ b@@ ating that this highly developed sex robot in a time to be threatened with the rights of women worldwide , in the White House , there are an President in the White House who are sur@@ g@@ ly attacked women .
the most terrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the most common body and the extinct eyes , but as a realistic manner .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but in the moment it feels like a large jump .
the goal of this sex robot is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women such as technically possible ( if even with Por@@ no@@ star @-@ Pro@@ por@@ tions ) .
her thinking would like that they are human being human being , that they im@@ it@@ ating the movement of a real body .
but , on the point , when it comes to its &quot; personalities , &quot; the robot is no real women .
you can not walk from your companion or easily .
you don &apos;t have any medi@@ ation or a background history , nothing that could cause independence on independence or something like what the imagination of the tot@@ als could trouble .
differently : they are different slaves .
or to press it in the Rede@@ mp@@ tions of 2017 .
Tru@@ mps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the principle of healthy human rights
it is to be a Bin@@ mp era , the Tru@@ mp era has become the political sphere that pol@@ arized the US elect@@ or@@ ate pol@@ arized , even families in the small format .
around Christmas and harvest , there were in the USA newspapers with rat@@ ors in the USA , and should be chosen with the hormon@@ es of Tru@@ mp .
we have applied to us all of the suppos@@ edly let all filter phases .
less noticed the power Tru@@ mps , families summ@@ ed together .
I have chosen because my C@@ se@@ dan , a left @-@ oriented Di@@ chter@@ in , which lives in Chicago , and has long been visited by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
they remin@@ ded me that the unit can have a common enemy on a common enemy .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can state , with whom she figh@@ ts to fight with decades of the policy , suddenly and suddenly disappeared on the same side .
in order to make the dining table , it certainly is a good thing , but it falls to me in another context that this also requires considerable risks .
the Lin@@ ke was reinforced by Tru@@ mp , but the effect of his presidency passed the force to move all to the right .
when we talk about &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ect way that we will not come to us on one day .
however , there is still a ch@@ cken@@ ron@@ es of long @-@ term scenario , in the Tru@@ mp Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which appear at once compared to his standards , as a statement .
I find me today from an active N@@ ost@@ algia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ani@@ ur@@ ic version of the plate , which saw 14 % income tax ( but at least did we know like his tax statement ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp in fact , as a very mil@@ de straight occur@@ ring .
when Tru@@ mp goes to qualify the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans only intellec@@ tu@@ g healthy , to qualify as an unbe@@ atable improvement .
when my c@@ ousine in the city was , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars to spend the city , if you don &apos;t need caff@@ eine caff@@ eine .
the horses are very large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cra@@ cked and the animals be turned to look forward to their own shoulders as well - extremely fin@@ ster and climate @-@ per@@ ous music .
so many cl@@ an area of a city dis@@ sol@@ ete : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines will become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream .
five : thirty years later , and I still did not all over the day , when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is not a Swiss Cot@@ tage , one of the themes of the pub of Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not one of the big roundabout in the north of London .
however , the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange experience , since there are two two years , a 11 @-@ year old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old , all of them have a great time .
if I could have the kar@@ us@@ sell would have , I would have given him the full score , but for luck there is no reason to get there .
on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &apos; experience with transactions on a scale of up to five stars before I could go out my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street there is the same thing about the option to buy the rating with a 15 % drinking money - this to buy something about the shop .
this is not only to a slow@@ down , which should actually be a neutral exchange , but as well as pressure on the server , in order to include personality in a situation .
the poor woman in the Kauf@@ haus stood at school , while I have tired of experience , you got my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain from prison transferred to the hospital .
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for the second time in prison for the second time .
last year , he was brought to the hospital with his hand , in which he had brought to the hospital , according to the authorities , according to a case in his cell .
pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted because of murder after an App@@ eal of prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first death .
he slew Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 , adding them several times by a door of toilets in the house in Pret@@ oria on her .
pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his gir@@ l@@ friend for a bar@@ gain pri@@ ze@@ ling that kept in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to return to the six @-@ year sentence of pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ eal , from which they say to the very dense .
the National Prosecutor said that it would be part of the Supreme Court of South Africa with the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the obj@@ ecting may be part of this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there are no death penalty to South Africa .

Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it out of his birds .
instead of a chicken , a small eagle was carried out .
but the hope to make a chicken , cr@@ ushed the eagle spread on a high mountain with its wings .
then the classes showed three and four in the studio of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken t@@ ance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder contributed to the bet .
the Adler stand for the integration , said school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te .
the young is quite different when the other young animals ( cows ) , is a member of it .
he will never be a chicken , but he will never be a chicken .
his determination is to be free to be freely .
she wanted any four @-@ piece reliability , feels it in his new school .
it was followed by gr@@ ass@@ uring to the colleagues of the former head of the former school , Michael Müller , who comes back again at the classes of teaching , and the parent representatives .
the cooking time is now past , called class Te@@ acher S@@ ophi@@ a Schumacher .
they leave their pupils after two years of lessons only very un@@ ners , because it was a really great time .
connection is finally able to leave it on the four t@@ k@@ rat@@ ors .
at the end , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time .
I broke with the children of great pleasure .
for the new school year , eight new reliability are already registered for the new school year .

we make the city of life
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ achs town council , continues in R@@ ente next year .
however , the place is already written - appropriate applications are however ra@@ r .
since 31 years , W@@ acker City builder .
and the work makes it even great fun as he conve@@ yed on the press conference .
he reports from varied , but also challenging tasks that are waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it &apos;s at the same time that so far no application needs the requirement profile .
the city is looking for the next possible date to an architect or building engineer .
it is supposed to be - considering the regular basis of regular basis - still enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach has been responsible for the administrative community as a sub @-@ legal authority . the application needs to pre pre pre pre pre pre @-@ mentioned .
for this function , the city will retain the city in any case .
if they would not fill up these no longer , the citizens would have travel to advice to Off@@ enburg .
however , the proximity of the city and him itself important , says W@@ acker that reports from a good working group as well as good mood between authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have collected on the W@@ acker with pride on pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city of life , &quot; he is about the building and its staff safe .
but in the future , there are varied projects at the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ parking space approximately are an@@ odi@@ zed .
the Kin@@ zig@@ bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the Sta@@ di@@ on@@ san@@ itation is still on subject .
at the moment alone , the latter only beat about 1.5 million euros , &quot; when we are right , &quot; estimates W@@ acker .
all in all , we are waiting for great tasks on my successor .
work here is fun . &quot;
an old town was set up for a city @-@ master large playing room .
with Has@@ l@@ achs &apos;s own Bau@@ hof and Gär@@ t@@ ner@@ ei can be flexibly respon@@ ds to the frequent quite flexibly .
it is possible to move , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the green areas of citizens of citizens and visitors often men@@ tions .
since the old town as a ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye which fits work , &quot; if new constructions have been approved , emphas@@ ised the city master .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has also become a great responsibility .
it is builder client , &quot; at the end running all here about my table . &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on long @-@ standing staff : Markus Neu@@ maier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has already been in charge for 15 years .
also that his successor remains , W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who want to be identified with the place really and stay . &quot;
because continuity is not only important for a good business climate , but also for the further design of the city .
those Roland W@@ acker would like to inform you to information about the city of Has@@ lach as a diploma in engineer or Bachelor with specialist direction architecture and have a good technical knowledge in the fields of construction and construction law .

bike on lines : South Tyrol &quot; dirt road
according to police , the blue bicycle had previously unknown the blue bicycle from the railway track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener street ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so strong damaged , that the her@@ b@@ ah@@ ating freight must be met .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpet@@ rat@@ ors and are looking for the night hours after them .
close to the scene , the witness had been watched by witnesses , and a bike rider .
&quot; &quot; that goes far beyond an Laus@@ bu@@ ben@@ ite , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A .
the or perpet@@ rat@@ ors have brought himself in a huge risk and can be endanger@@ ed with the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the L@@ ok and the plant , as well as the delay flight and the cost of rail traffic , even P@@ ön@@ als of the train clients can be sent to the perpet@@ rat@@ ory customer .
a total of &quot; significant &quot; sum , the spokes@@ person on the spokes@@ person .
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southern track could be run without disabilities .
nearly ten passenger cars were unusual , morning , two of which are covered by the traffic .
however , they were not made , however , were delay .
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced by around 200 meters of upper lines .
Isol@@ ators and Ma@@ sten were also damaged .
raw meat , dairy products and chocolate could help , IB@@ D ( inflammatory bo@@ wel disease )
raw meat and chocolate can sound for your diges@@ tive system as a night@@ mare .
but a new study claimed on the contrary : a diet , rich in meat @-@ based protein and dairy products , could improve symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases .
the un@@ healed condition which affects approximately CHF 1.3 million in the United States , causes thi@@ es and bub@@ bles , recur@@ ring or blo@@ od@@ shed , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
during the person concerned , meat and dairy products used to reach their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an caused by proteins that promote immune cells to develop a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the Chief researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , declared to ensure the immune cells in the intest@@ ine pat@@ rol to ensure that the micro@@ algae are hidden in the food , not in the body .
cells , which are able to be able to prevent inflammation of cells , which protect the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues .
if the balance is too far away in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance of the immune cell in mice is found that a particular bacter@@ ium in their initi@@ ate .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an - one of the blocks of proteins in order to termin@@ ate the identity of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacter@@ ium species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus Co@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ ine micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
according to more tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an the mice in their food , the more had these immune cells . &quot;
he proposed that the combination of L. K@@ ter@@ i and an tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an varied diet toler@@ ances , less than inflammatory intestinal functions , when the same system also do with people .
the Post@@ d@@ ok@@ tor@@ and@@ in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan run a kind of immune cell that had found that a group of study proteins such cells , but had a group of the same stem , which was separated , but it was not separated , this had not separated .
they believed to do the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ous of mice , the community of bacteria , viruses and mushroom , which normally live in the stomach @-@ intestinal Tra@@ kt .
the deriv@@ atives of the mice was detected DNA sequ@@ enced and were found six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells , but without they were missing in mice .
mice were drawn up in a ster@@ ile environment , so that they were not developed by the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they were developed to L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immun@@ ity cells .
to understand how the bacteria could be found on the immune system , researchers L. K@@ ter@@ i found a liquid in a liquid and then carried out small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria , which were isolated from the mice .
the immuno@@ cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component from the liquid has been cleaned , it proved to be used as a secondary product of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism , that is known as an In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid .
if researchers have doubled the amount of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in the food of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells fell by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people had the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect us in our stomach @-@ intest@@ ine tra@@ ders .
it is not known that Tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an @-@ anne@@ x @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i found cells in people as in mice but defects were found in relation to tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in humans with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
she said , &quot; the development of these cells is probably a bit that we want to promote these cells on the inner surface of Dar@@ ms .
potential may lead to high tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an values in the presence of L. K@@ ter@@ i as an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic is obliged to have a &quot; Genie . &quot;
at Manchester United has signed with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic a &quot; Genie , &quot; says Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pounds of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last season game before the UEFA Cup against Real Madrid will begin on Tuesday , and impressive in the H@@ alter role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira after exposure .
matic was , however , was excluded from the fore@@ front @-@ tour of Blues and managed only 45 minutes , making mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho who had to improve the Premier League @-@ season ahead of the beginning of the Premier League @-@ season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way how did not think of football , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho .
we will help him to help him earlier than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u in the Avi@@ va stadium , as Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho will be the start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed in this week that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho wanted three more recent development , but he insist@@ ed that the club had already made a &quot; fantastic work , &quot; three of his four priority news .
&quot; &quot; &quot; three of four to get , thanks for the association &quot; I , added to the society . &quot;
&quot; I will happy to be happy if they receive four of four , but they have given great efforts . &quot;
Boeing &quot; mal@@ t &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the Sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilot flew by Seattle in the US state of Washington , and the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in US state of Michigan , and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens , the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a stam@@ ina for new engines .
for example , Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in heaven .
new challenge for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as part of the wind , there is : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , the Socialist Prime Minister , attracted a certain audience of the elections in front of the elections .
merely no stor@@ ms out of the party &apos;s headquarters , merely no counter@@ wind from the covenant - as it is the most important request of the elect@@ oral man .
since Martin Schulz , the party has changed significantly .
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus , with increasing the disc@@ ern@@ ing the events in the SPD @-@ ruled state capit@@ als .
what inspired Schulz from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described with counter@@ wind .
it was deep pl@@ unge into .
and one after another .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , a generic signal against Ko@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
this will once again show more : red @-@ green can not be tra@@ cker , &quot; said to the Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprising frac@@ tions of an Gre@@ ens @-@ MP@@ s voted the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a heavy crisis .
five months before the day @-@ election , its red @-@ green coalition lost their one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the Gre@@ ens @-@ Federal Executive Board Michael Win@@ ner has asked the ab@@ low @-@ s@@ wis@@ s Gre@@ s@@ wis@@ s Green League member , which was asked to return to Mand@@ ate .
however , the figure occurs between CDU means a clear delay of the vot@@ ers .
El@@ ke Twe@@ sten is immediately back to Mand@@ ate , &quot; said the Federal managing director and campaign manager of the Green Association of the Green Network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
but that &apos;s why everything will not be true , &quot; se@@ avi@@ or , a SPD elect@@ oral , when Friday afternoon the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ banned the party &apos;s headquarters .
Stephan Weil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands on the role of the green MP@@ s El@@ ke Twe@@ sts for CDU without their own government .
it is the temporary cli@@ max of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD .
and no one knows what next comes next .
the missions began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more did not have the comra@@ des in a stone time .
according to the annual general election in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , all in other countries .
it was then even worse - in fact everything was worse - even worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the Tau@@ m@@ ess , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite Party .
work in the weeks afterwards , comra@@ des fell back to the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him the next low@@ ers came back .
Mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD @-@ Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost the last weekend of Nim@@ bus , because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burnt down .
and because he is in the crisis of the crisis , so quite everything made it wrong , which you can do it wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz figh@@ ts about its political survival .
now , Stephan Weil , so now also Stephan Weil , too .
due to the VW exhaust emission and its role in the Supervisory Board of the Lower Saxony , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister , has already been on criticism of criticism .
mi@@ ese re@@ fraction are added .
nevertheless , or perhaps just therefore , he tried to put more stronger in the Bund acc@@ ents for the past few weeks .
the best@@ owed of the former mayor of Hanover , his power in Berlin , was also hidden in the environment by Martin Schulz .
they left him , because they spoke of for stabil@@ ise the party .
now , the exact opposite could occur .
in the residential building of the Lower Saxony , the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens does not contain any debt due to this meeting .
and Mr Schulz don &apos;t know yet .
in order to stay , the comra@@ des is therefore closed to keep the own rows .
your wrath is aimed at the countryside , and here especially on the ab@@ r@@ all@@ ni@@ ge Par@@ ari@@ erin Twe@@ sten .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , like Mrs. Twe@@ sts of their own car@@ rots for the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the party left in the SPD @-@ Bundestag , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mrs. Twe@@ sts is not elected to the parliament as a director of the Lower Saxony , but also elected the state of Lower Saxony , as the Lower Saxony &apos;s Lower Saxony .
the logical consequence , it would be , that she gives her Mand@@ ate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD @-@ Bundestag , accused of a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ oeuvre . &quot;
for four years ago the Wä@@ hl@@ er@@ wil@@ le was clear : the man have made Stephan Weil to prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony as a top candidate in the Bundestag on the R@@ ND .
&quot; now , the personal carto@@ ons of a future CDU MP@@ s , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he required to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if more , or it has been continued with more recent days of the CDU Lower Saxony .
funding of the town centre III
who would like to visit his home in the years , may soon be able to get support from the country .
on Wednesday , the Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of St@@ em city development on Wednesday is in sens@@ ations .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler had even had a look back at the date of the present events .
since 1991 it has been working in a sens@@ ing areas .
at that time , in the san@@ itation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Baden @-@ Württemberg country is still taken over two thirds of the promotion sum .
in the san@@ itation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the daily allow@@ ance is still at 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous re@@ ings are a &quot; Succ@@ ess project &quot; - it was finally important to promote the inner development , and not only new construction areas .
on April 4 , one will receive the information that there will be a san@@ itation area III on 4 April .
the total amount of 8@@ 33 333 Euros , of which it is 500 000 euros away from the land , the rest of the commune &apos;s community .
how is now a san@@ itation area ?
one would like to examine as Sch@@ in@@ dler continues , examine , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
there are also a role whether to transform in the planned territory of any interest .
this may also be sent to the District borders then again .
the conc@@ ession of the Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
as part of the cellar , the contents of the federal states @-@ Programme &quot; Social City , presented within the framework of the San@@ ee@@ pers would be carried out .
core of the programme are the Rev@@ it@@ alization of Inn@@ enst@@ r , enhancing the improve and work conditions and receipt of infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is , per plot .
the san@@ itation area would be set down as a set .
the fun@@ eral period for the eligi@@ bility period has been running since 1 January 2017 to 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September of this year , however , the current situation would be carried out once , in the context of which the question@@ n@@ aires was able to fill a question@@ naire .
in November or December , the Code of the Statute is to be carried out in the next year with the san@@ al can be started .
in fact , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann declared that each commune should be taken out into account .
it is therefore to evaluate the urban planning of mis@@ ery and decide when it is refurbished and in which extent .
it may then be entered in the basic book for the following plot .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann would like to come again after receiving a picture from the situation , she spoke them .
Got@@ zel emphasized , a crucial success factor for the project was the co @-@ impact of participants .
therefore , question@@ n@@ aires will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out by the end of summer holidays .
the yellow question@@ naire is the &quot; Building and boundary arch , &quot; where it is among other things about the construction state and the re@@ organisation prospects .
in the grey question@@ naire , the &quot; Hou@@ sehold and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; can be made up to the size , breakdown and inhabitants of a residential area .
the blue &quot; mode &quot; is only available to fill in the building business premises .
however , the Got@@ zel proved to be noted that a re@@ plen@@ ish question@@ n@@ aires are not required at the same time .
also new development measures are not capable .
Sch@@ in@@ dler emphas@@ ised that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; wind@@ surfing principle &quot; - who first comes first , ma@@ zes first .
you might have any support for the &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot;
in conclusion , photos of the project &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II , &quot; shown in order to make a rehabilitation &quot; tasty . &quot;

a British inventor is the first in the country which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , that it can open his door to open his office and can even start his car .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had impl@@ anted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and hands @-@ free and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to do their lives with technology by its company bio@@ te@@ q .

the technology is similar to a cats and dogs , it takes only 30 seconds .
the company of North@@ North@@ am also want to change the castle on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , for a surcharge of £ 300 per castle .

the advertising cost of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers of thousands
the decision of the White House , an nav@@ ed @-@ helicopter in the South La@@ wn for an event to carry out the American production in the last month , the tax of interest paid by the military , which were left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when President of the board was on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American development programmes .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice @-@ President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials for the White House made a round tour of products from all 50 states .
the helicop@@ ters was presented in Connecticut with a yacht from Ma@@ ine , an fire@@ men of Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi earlier .
the military office of the White House designed the presence of helicop@@ ters in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( HM@@ x @-@ 1 ) , which is responsible for the operation of helicop@@ ters .
I wanted to make sure that you are aware of it , because it is a unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; wrote the com@@ ur of the HM@@ x @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to the deputy of the Deputy Commander of the aviation industry .
the news revealed that the helicopter was taken in the morning at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South of La@@ wn for the event , and so long until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 clock in this evening .
note that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of service hours a second team would be required for the return flight .
during the event , the original air@@ planes were found during the helicop@@ ters , while the unit remained at the ground during the time on the ground at the plane .
the records provided that the TI@@ ME were not clear if there was a second flight format was required .
the Hat@@ ch Act offers the Federal Government to use state property for political purposes .
data sets show that HM@@ x @-@ 1 has asked for the event to prevent the event .
a question that we ordered , whether it was a violation of the Hat@@ ch Acts , and we were informed that this is not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
sounds as if you are sealed , &quot; said the deputy commander .
the event &quot; Made in America , &quot; the White House was called the official event and would not be covered by the Hat@@ ch Act .
but also official events have policy @-@ tones .
on the event , the President gave a sign for the reform of health reform , which was in the Senate in the G@@ ange , and he was implic@@ ated the efforts to win in the government of the government .
the use of the plane which is known as Marine One or Air Force One known , from politically , it is hardly a new phenomenon .
President are obliged to use them for the trip .
but its use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
in February , Tru@@ mp resulted in an investigation as the presidential plane against the background of his first Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of mel@@ ody for its predecessor , through its predecessor .
the White House is thri@@ lled by the show &quot; Made in America , &quot; the products from all 50 states which are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy press release of the White House , Lind@@ sey Wal@@ ters .
HM@@ x @-@ 1 occupying forces often lead training flights in the area around Washington and the South La@@ wn in order to add the US President in the White House with precise centimeters .
when Tru@@ mp was at the beginning of July at the G20 summit in Germany , HM@@ x @-@ 1 took place in the White House 58 workouts .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was one of the training needs of air@@ planes for the month , he said .
in addition , Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew over 11 hours to this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support &quot; com@@ missions . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers presented the load for no one of the other re@@ alities that were presented at the event .
a speaker by Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company would not have been involved in the South La@@ wn at the South of La@@ wn .
HM@@ x @-@ 1 maintains no Bud@@ dy drawings for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost for the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ zation of the U.S. Department of Defense for the financial year 2017 , the Do@@ D system set at the end of 2017 , however , 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
records of the unit , the flight time of flight plane is 30 minutes from the home base of the Navy Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost for the operation of helicop@@ ters can be far under this rate .
&quot; the costs for the tax pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates is extremely serious , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; this estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs , which are included in the annual funding . &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the share volume for Do@@ D does not contain the personnel costs , but take into account the cost for fuel , maintenance and contract .
at this time the former press Officer of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ell , had the use of helicop@@ ters for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present these week things to present in America , &quot; said Sp@@ aces . &quot;
and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the State of Connecticut are proud to contribute to our national security , and I expect it that hundreds of thousands of them are dependent on .
and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , who worked as many Americans .
it is of course appropriate to increase . &quot;
it was not clear that Tru@@ mp was inter@@ ned with the helicopter , as he was his tour through the South La@@ wn for the event , but he continued into the driver &apos;s seat in a fire@@ men .
in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to the representative of Si@@ kor@@ sky with the media over his own fleet of corporate products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very good , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before tri@@ cky task
leader of the Second Tennis @-@ Bundes@@ liga leaders occurs at the championship &apos;s third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss occurs tomorrow from 11 am in Kiel at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
despite five games still macro@@ performance , the leader of the Second Tennis @-@ Bundes@@ liga won the sense for reality .
team boss Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has any respect to the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team that plays a similar formation in quite similar formation .
just on the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability in the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV , most of the imports coming from the high North .
the Danish and Fin@@ n can refer to the Davis Cup round on the Davis Cup .
they are also strong in double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with views of Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Sweden ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben Ol@@ ese , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen as well as Andreas Bj@@ er@@ stra@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; this will be difficult for us . &quot;
you need also a good portion of luck . &quot;
the ne@@ uss@@ ers team for the trip to the high north is practically .
his debut for the Blue @-@ white could be Maxim@@ e .
currently , at the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella , there is currently no French@@ man not to take the Bundes@@ liga in the Czech Liber@@ ec playing Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) to its first use in this season .
the so far un@@ defeated the Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the White rus@@ sen An@@ three Vasi@@ lev@@ ski still at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on Ball .
it should be in Kiel but as well as Bo@@ tic Van de Z@@ and@@ eli@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both the Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories in the past Sunday at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ d@@ z could once again be back to the team .
enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was the number one of the Junior Wel@@ fare list in January 2016 , not , when someone comes from the train@@ ing@@ time by Mari@@ us Z@@ ay .
like the Americas with O@@ MV damage

Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not re@@ sum@@ ed in their persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar after making it an offer of £ 189 million to dissolve his free@@ ass@@ ass@@ land , but in Barcelona she warned about three years before the world record ?
the sensational approach is heated in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record , with Paul Pog@@ ba , who returned to Manchester United Kingdom in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing Ne@@ ym@@ ar to the most expensive players in the world and to the highest paid professional sport@@ s@@ men of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is w@@ ishing about the way to en@@ forced , how Ne@@ ym@@ ar has chosen its way to the outside of the Catalonia , although the club has always given his best to take care of a look for him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .

I am not concerned because they know if they are one of our player , then we will contact opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we resp@@ ects all the clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot;

PS@@ G made clear that it would not be able to travel to the International Criminal Tribunal for Italy , and in Barcelona , the consequences of this interest could be felt that they lost one of their price range for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Report report by Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reports about the abuse of we@@ ather@@ ed Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann is the author of the author and historian Michael E@@ emann .
the final report on the Miss@@ y sc@@ andal pl@@ agu@@ ing the Dom@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ litter continues for discussions .
Christian Blatt@@ ner , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated by the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI .
it would be the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church very serve , when Mu@@ eller and R@@ atz@@ inger had their deepest on their own signature or at that time the false estim@@ ation of the processes would be press .
the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; on the other hand cri@@ tici@@ zed that in the reporting on violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station , &quot; was measured .
regarding the over@@ gri@@ ps in Regensburg , no one has to be prevented in order to be prevented in the future , however , the &quot; degree of medi@@ al manipulation . &quot; thus the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee .
&quot; the accused , the Catholic Church as the source of all plague , is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion that said for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
in an interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk , the Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n and tax@@ is said , said , &quot; we would like to go on the church and it is a few minutes . &quot;
in addition she pointed out that in their youth , &quot; a very well @-@ known ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; was to be done to be done with great children , as I was one of his youth . &quot;
they are un@@ fair , today &apos;s standards on previous decades , because the world have changed .
in connection with the reports of the reports about the mis@@ sive cases , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was often used .
completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who translated with R@@ atz@@ inger memor@@ andum from the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; because all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; the results of the final report .
what is exactly what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report that presented by the diocese of Regensburg ( Ulrich Weber ) ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were carried out between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high Pl@@ au@@ si@@ bly &quot; victim of over@@ flow , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexual sexually ab@@ uses .
in the final report , it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , so that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence .
even in high emotional functionality , the ir@@ radiation could also be rec@@ ir@@ radiation for the pupils also .
nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other restrictions , many victims of the general rule of R. estim@@ ating and therefore , in numerous cases , despite being a positive memories of him . &quot;
in an interview , Hes@@ emann , why the final report for the abuse of power was given to the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report about the &quot; inci@@ dents of the violence of violence in the Dom@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; there is a contradic@@ tory image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for a lift , many students welcomed his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , it appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perf@@ ec@@ om@@ ist , who was much more brilliant , when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz had no top performance .
how to check out this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if one read the trouble , and all the 440 pages long report from the front to the behind , you have to ask , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is found at all .
it is just eight pages dedicated to him , and he is clearly acqu@@ itted from any susp@@ ici@@ on of the Mitt@@ al or co @-@ leader in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the non @-@ violence school at the pre @-@ school event took place outside of its effect .
you can clari@@ fy Him that could learn about late or first disc@@ lose it enough .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymnasi@@ um , in which he worked for almost all respon@@ dents in order to be taken literally - &quot; rede@@ mption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
thus , the vast majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes a very well @-@ known witness , &quot; competent , &quot; competent , &quot; competent teacher , who plays the guys with cakes , cookies and Bon@@ b@@ ons , and had been seized by grapes of children . &quot;
just a minority worth just over his perf@@ ism and its high emotional ality , which led to W@@ ut@@ out .
that he did not only threw with chairs on the ground , but even ear@@ ns against the hair and ears , even ear@@ thly matters to the hair or ears , he has even been abandoned even before years ago .
however , he has to be confused , however , that such education methods must be spread in the days of the 1960s , the 1960s and 1970s , they were widespread , with parents such as teachers .
do you know yet to know such coun@@ sel@@ ing methods ?
of course I think everyone from us , who was born in 1968 .
I also experienced that in a world @-@ school school , experienced a state @-@ school .
compared to what a report is actually written in this report , namely the sexual abuse of sexual abuse and the violence of violence in the primary school , the free Bag@@ at@@ ellen were .
there is no matter whether it is not even with his friend and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI , so many media has just over him .
at the Bavarian State of Pope , many who never understood him never , still ei@@ fri@@ g .
but the truth is : the report of the la@@ ve Georg R@@ atz@@ inger report in every respect !
in the media context this report was reported to report a lot about the topic of abuse at the Dom@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
with regard to sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will also be used in terms of sexual abuse during sexual abuse .
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual inter@@ ns claims to have become a domain master .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
I never take up my father with my father , or my mother . &quot; he said to talk about my father , &quot; said , &quot; said all very p@@ ein@@ y . &quot;
the true problem at the information of sexual abuse was , however , is that most of the victims of Sh@@ am .
if they don &apos;t have her parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then all of the choral conductors , but he would have been unable to have been able to have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
how this is the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen pupils R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the ab@@ li@@ vi@@ ties ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a frag@@ mented pupils formulated this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see no case , in which he could have had preced@@ ence ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) .
I do it ... even for really absur@@ d , accept that it would be more quickly and clear or even more , when compared to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ ants , confi@@ denti@@ als , confi@@ denti@@ sts , etc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he speaks with him about sex ... - hours . &quot;
thus , the report on the quite clear result : &quot; that would not be aware of the prior @-@ out students and / or their environment could not be confirmed as part of the study . &quot;
what do sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus working from everyone to discuss .
thus , it can &apos;t be charged with him , not prevented him or to have brought him .
therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name with these resist@@ ed crimes in connection as it was unfortunately in some cases .
in the media was much of &quot; violence ex@@ z@@ essen &quot; to read the Dom@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
the earlier domain of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will be charged with the earlier domain of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger report .
do he must live with this design ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the great problem that in the coverage of all mixed and men@@ tions it was removed from sexual abuse of sexual abuse and violence in the middle of the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly that , in turn , is a abuse of report .
there is a clean separately between the school and the Gymnasium of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence and non @-@ violence .
in addition , the report deals from the time since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choral head of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station .
the whole horri@@ fying test education , cases , in which the boys of sa@@ di@@ st teachers were painted and , among them were meant to have suffered at the school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sk@@ andal@@ ous states have to have gone .
but with those who had Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger didn &apos;t do anything , because he got the boys only to face , when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymnasi@@ um .
on the same way , as the very witness of the witness , the theme &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ le@@ u . &quot;
it was only happy to be coming to his and gen@@ oss the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise . &quot;
what was unlike the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymnasi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : as a result of discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ sti@@ cker violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report conclu@@ des that &quot; many victims of the General Assembly of R. estim@@ ating and therefore , in numerous cases , despite being a positive memories of him . &quot;
at most of the pre@@ set , not even the pre@@ dat@@ or , not to have st@@ owed away .
but despite all efforts , the report was able to define two time rooms , in which he was reported by the states on the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he started to establish itself , and from the processes on a school , which he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t hear anything , and then again in 1993 .
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger closed out the ears of the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymnasi@@ um , which was even produced in 1989 .
it is therein all this point , &quot; that in the pre @-@ school school , the test penalty will be practic@@ ed . &quot;
already in view of the risk of negative pres@@ sur@@ prises , he was a result of the risk of disease worsen@@ ing .
this was , of course , as a legal consequences , as it was forbidden in Bavaria since it was forbidden in Bavaria .
before that they occurred in a legal grey zone , as everyone from us probably still knows .
it was also difficult for him to estimate that the affected may have been exceeded , or dra@@ fting , and where the permissible limit was exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say it , he would have been sh@@ y .
it &apos;s true not .
only in 1980 , the test penalty was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria in 1980 .
Für@@ y Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n and tax@@ is maintained , it is un@@ fair to turn today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards in the time .
how do you see ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we talked to talk given from the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of the An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger of past , past today &apos;s moral dimensional .
the Für@@ y has already quite right .
but this is of course not the most important abuse of sexual abuse , which was broken off to all times , and violence at un@@ school children . it was broken that already far beyond that time , it &apos;s not far beyond that time .
that &apos;s everything very terrible and I am glad that it &apos;s finally worked .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all that had nothing to do with him .
his means to identify and ir@@ radiation , thus ear@@ ns in the hair and ears to move to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
then , as a physical activity , he was banned as a physical activity .
what Picture from his reg@@ ens@@ burger time , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger wrote for the discussions with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; ?
came the subject of testing also to language ?
Michael E@@ emann : now , in the book it goes to the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedict XVI , tells of his perspective , as the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only one side .
nevertheless , I didn &apos;t understand that there was a stric@@ ter regim@@ ent .
but even though this would have to be said that time : without these perf@@ ism , it would be hardly possible to become a member of world @-@ known reg@@ ens@@ ity known as a cultural heritage of Europe and his musical tradition which went twice in the United States ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone you would like to resist the boys now no big singer and before any success , right in which the area , but discipline , passion and self @-@ win@@ dow@@ ns .
as what for a man you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at the discussions with their book ?
Michael E@@ emann : due to work on the book and beyond , I &apos;ve met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really met again and again , in humor@@ ous , humor@@ ous , deep breath and warm good people , from which one could do not have to do something like a fly .
I get regularly with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still exists today , 23 years after his empi@@ ri@@ ot , regularly paid contact with him , &quot; he is almost blind and him like a member of her family .
those who don &apos;t awarded him to today , that he was once a strictly limited to them , are therefore clear in the minority .
most domain extensions are grat@@ eful for him today that it has en@@ riches her life and to them the world of music .
and that he always had a good , fathers , and a certain father , a certain that may be , but may be there - but also a lovely values in response to it was still looking down to it .
and please , once again , once again : everything that we used to look , are educ@@ ators , who were at the same time in the agenda .
we may be happy that we have overcome this time .
but it is extremely odd right , a man only because he is promin@@ ently and a prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sin bo@@ ck .
since the evil intention is evil , which stands behind it , is obvious .
because the report , which was just released , is la@@ ve him .
now anyone would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired large mer@@ its , and perhaps there is no one no one to get the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station , finally , in peace in peace .
