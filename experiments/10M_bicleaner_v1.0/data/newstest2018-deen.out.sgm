<seg id="74">Since he is also called the BLHV-Chairman of Fishbach, it is important as elementary project as a "elementary project."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not play any steep surfaces in such parts.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area for much work, much that is working with the motor sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">We have shown here with the conditions and to fight with the Topography "stressed Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he had taken over the eleventh operation and put into account for this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not guide it.</seg>
<seg id="79">For Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "the commune has recognized the significance of the crossover project, and is delighted with the leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, the farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hope that the request of the areas could still be pushed for a whole time.</seg>
<seg id="82">We have the greatest treasure that we have people who work in agriculture work, and thoughts about how they continue to bring their operations. "says the mayor's mayor.</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often often found in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">Over the crossover networks have been fenced in 2013, a total of 25 participants were fenced.</seg>
<seg id="85">The primary open area is about 40 hectares, which may not be used by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">The total cost of 71 500 euros was funded by the leader, a quarter to the Municipality of Fishbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">So the farmers were able to invest 12 610 euros, which had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of consecuckle.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," declared Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you really does a really good job, without farmers and landing."</seg>
<seg id="90">Even for Peter White stood there: "here best food has been produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscrubbing line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state promotion of Weideocene.</seg>

<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump can now be created by the White House of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="99">The transparent first signs of a regime exchange is it when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate that just like any other - therefore the sorrow was staged by the fall of Saddam Hussein's Firm in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key idea of the Trump regimes, knew what he did, when he did a symbolic court with Jim Acosta by CNN about the suggestions of the president to drastic limitation of the legalthy emigration with the freedom of liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">In order to remain fair, Miller (not the statue).</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators have had infeed it, if he had done.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he handle its meaning, and especially the importance of which it was considered to be the famous poem of Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after completion of the thinking, was added again.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta gimminated: "I will not go to a complete diing over history, but the freedom of the statue is... a symbol of American freedom, which encaptures the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, on which you can refer to which later, was added later, and not part of the original language is known. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is amazing right, but as it is formulated, it's not really a story.</seg>
<seg id="108">It's about the performance of Lazarus, which invites the only one, in which a state not only charges any old immigrants, but the sleeves of the poor, "your poor, your poor, / your bemourged masses which are looking for atmen, / the attacking of thy waters."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "elende waste" was better to see better on our screen.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller committed itself in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome to Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the importance of a statue, part of a wider political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict in fact the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who refused to place their words after her death on the basis of the basis, had very good that she has completed a high political party.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American-American Republicism by adding them in one of the most popular classical representation of the female Coörperation of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this importance: in its poem, the female figure is not more abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she herself is a very other name: mother of the Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the Gedike with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just like Lazarus, the importance of the statue changed, the people wanted to return from right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The big write hals Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of being infiltring, rather rather a early neo-condoms existed in which the American flame burned down in the world: "Lady Liberty continues.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is alleged to bear the Fackel the Freedom of the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The fackel should not be the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual, Limbaugh stayed here on a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of the perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great phantasievolle indeed of Lazarus was, as they see, as they had seen from the exhaustible, but hoped full people after long and often terrible travel on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the true sense of how to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge, and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of the hope and of the welcome, which they must listen.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective, the Miller and Trump can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their fackel should not have the way to light, but the hatred, who is the only source of power, ignited the power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World championship 2017: Neil Black with Scottish members of the United Kingdom</seg>

<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland has developed something special" and the athletics of the United Kingdom to learn something.</seg>
<seg id="133">We welcome you to understand, and we try to understand, and we will run it, until we'll need to figure out what kind. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"I speak with people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">What is always the combination of circumstances is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athlete are medals candidates, amongst them Laura Muir and Andrew Butcher - who can compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eiliie Doyle was elected to the team.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is pretty modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their chapter was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">A number of athletes, no matter whether they were Scottish, or where they are still living or train, went out of the room and felt very motivating.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the genuine feeling, the olidh made of course, was great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth Silver medaillons winner, who is going to compete in the fifth world championships in the 400-m hurdle, says that it is unbelievably, that 16 Shots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland has so far been the best number of athletes at the World Championship in 1983, which was reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The Middle Ages Muir route leads on this road and has five British and two European records in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m floor.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another piece that is one of the great season to observe the victory at the British team Trias and the Anniversary Games, watch.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminiscent of her first World Cup, when the only other Schotte was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The Mannery capitals said that they are very proud "that many of their fellow countrymen are not only among the team, but in some cases also in the medals and at the Finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">To be the special team of this team, that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that my team mate was voted for me, and have chosen me to become something special for me, "added to them."</seg>
<seg id="152">I obviously very proud to all the shots, which are part of the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows just how far we come, as far we come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here a established athlete, athletes, who want to climb on Podies.</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech delivered as an capitals?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think they went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, since we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">It's really important to set this home support and take advantage of that we are back in the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there, and to compete, it's just as a great atmosphere as outside. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Block of critics on Facebook: Bezb are not to be a public office if you don't wear the heaters of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country, knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it took not long until the newspapers brought him for themselves because of the interior policy up to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He immigrated to criticism, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not brought his critic.</seg>
<seg id="165">As in the year 1783, Washington said: "the Redemption of freedom can be taken away - and, dummed and unreaded, we will have led to the sheep."</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on me to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan employee have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people, which have sold their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">In the beginning of this week, the American Civil Liberties Union agree him so that this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The staff of the Governments left the lawsuit against Frvol., and the online commentary was full of a counteract with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "it's just Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important when it is like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the nation's 50 governors.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is no reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has a fixed hand in the leadership of its state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect Facebook to his voters, and have his haarless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blockage of people who come on the side of the Governments - which is officially referred to as officially as officially referred to and by employees that are paid by public tax-dollar - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defended Hogans speaking to Amelia Chasse, the actions of the governors and argued that the comments of the comments are nothing more than a presation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's easy to use the image of trolls or split-filled people, which are online the Peits.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the actual people who had blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And that are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They said all the comments that their comments were full, reconcise and not to work.</seg>
<seg id="184">The parish of the parish is the Bible in his post and appelated of Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney Lakshmi rama Ramani by Bowie, MD., was not hassas, but she asked him to break.</seg>
<seg id="186">I commented the polite, I disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current messages, "wrote in the commentary range of the news release" The Post. "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I'm not even if a number of people go to the same position, then they will be recognized by some more than a so called collective risk of citizens and not considered a major group of citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">What employees of the Governments as "concentrated spam attack" would call others would be "intercession". "</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut to a message by simply a critic or a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times, if one would have been the same that employees were sanded to collect newspapers with the critical goods, and to burn or demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But this happens just digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials that criticized by Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump will be accused of Twitter users suffering from Twitter, which were blocked by his Twitter Feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in one of the first milestones in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County, the last First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, called by a voters from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">In Kentucky, Governor Matt. (R) was also obtained a visit to the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">That should not be difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time Washington's time, the time of an affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers are promising between 1776 and 1800, and an anonymous letter proposed to his lead.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time, anonymous, anonymous, was anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="201">People who have pseudonyme like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Porcio" used, wrote all letters of newspapers, Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petite, who criticized its point of view over the Treaty of Amity, the trade and the shipping industry for the United Kingdom, according to the historic documents, collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not brought them to the tail.</seg>
<seg id="204">Speech, opinion of opinion, and discourses are among the basis of our nation.</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means that we accept.</seg>

<seg id="1356">Two brothers have four decades after their Italian family who founded the dynasty in one of the largest real estate in Victorias, worth more than 500 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and its assets should be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to move from family business since 2014, but a sharp conflict with the separation will take place in the Supreme Court.</seg>

<seg id="1360">The Westco family founded Jeans and grew up in a chain of 160 retail shops.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis includes offices in the penitrum, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Following an agreement with their deceased father, Colin made by Paul as "principal operators and the dominant personality in family De Lutis - about two thirds of the company's wealth and Paul is roughly one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A judicial file says that this means that Colin made a value of USD 316 million and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The allocation of real estate and cash has proved itself for Paul as an empipoint.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "by Colin proposed deseres have left him with the left what I held for the best objects," he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The first hearing of the Supreme Court ruling was held last Friday after several failed agents.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers are now to fight with the control over the existing business - including Colin, like Paul claimed that he was excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argued that this is not true, but threaded Paul, some of their possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affidavit, which was filed by Colin made by Colin he hope he hope to fight against the fight.</seg>
<seg id="1371">He wrote my Italian heritage that the family is the most important priority, "he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports of companies, among them Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck, including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Ms. De Lutis and her husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, who operated dairy bars and delicacies of the late 1950-10 years and in the early seventies a shop in Brunswick bought.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They use the safety to buy the Collingwood property, in Colin made the first Jeansary family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he began to use Westco there when he was "during my last years, when Paul still was a small child (about 10 years old).</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she died and Luigi, who died in the year 2012, hoped to continue their property to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land that the brothers said before," wrote them. "</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are not part of the De Lutis group of companies, and Colin claims that Mark were paid for the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1379">Both Luke and Mark are also, Paul "says Paul" over the conditions of their financial instruments. "</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin made himself very return, although it was a former AFL member board and following a biography in 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the television stars.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media took on contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their attacking contact.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Only Colin answered by SMS, to say "I can't say much," because the case before the dishes is.</seg>
<seg id="1383">It is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to move me to resting me and our family names through the dishes, "he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid 2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the Court that he tries to meet the demands of his brother.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Our Father would not have been noted that Paul and I would do in our current fight, "he said, and said," he said, "said that it was still a solution."</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps new Chief of Staff plans to include the media abinence of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others are tried and have failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If yes, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict information on President Trump - including the reports of news media - in hope to keep the chief of a uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey here:</seg>
<seg id="1394">When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, he gave his first working day with leading staff in his first day, he set up a main problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he got to repentage: bad information about the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or letter - because the President will meet the decisions that would be good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Winys diagnosis makes sense but others tried to add Trump to perforated by using its media advice.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relation to Television as well as decades - and now, where he is still in the White House, is still quite strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">When the candidate of Trump was due to an unfair reporting, it was productive to show that he received a fair reporting of places that were to convince themselves, "said the former electoral consultant Sam Nunberg in February against politico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that "the key, Trumps Twitter is under control, according to six former electoral fight in the fight, ensuring that his personal media account has a steady appeal."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter is ever "under control" was ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps, this Kampagners officials somewhat something what we do not know that Trumps tweets have included without their interventions, even more spark plug.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never experienced something about the Tweets that Trump cannot be sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">When he made his colleague it has been able to hold a few times, sleeves of him, then their efforts was worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has been consistently prevent the Trump Kontroversen.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that people in a white house that set up in a white house, and again trying to present their own agenda by using Trump material, which may support their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - all with this history - reported in May about the preparations of the advisor to the President of the strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react to negative press sections, especially those with cordiaphragm angle, and that he would find out to find out where these originate.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly that happened at the end of February when someone asked the President of an article by GotNews.com, the site of the Internet provocateur-in Katie Walsh, "which was the source behind a bunch at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Even though Johnson was exiled to date from Twitter, or that he has no concrete evidence, or that he sold it in the past false stracts and she calls it in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to talk about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">In addition, Goldmacher is added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage a paper and document the Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">What has the folding?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do three months later, the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps it will prove as an effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still very impulsive self, and its adviser are still striving to influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unmodified factors make Winys mission is very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1531">North of this Schelfey was the balance of juniper and break before some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete shaker have been there to fall there, writes AWI research scientist Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot of reason why the Larsen-C-Schelcelebrated's danger exists in danger, because the front edge have never been removed so far as far.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate under voltage and could be crushed, if there is a piece of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of shoppose and Eisberg increases the sea level, because they swim on the water and sweeping them so much water, as it was due to the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the shines that means that the glacier can directly flow directly into the sea and much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">However, this could increase the sea level, however, only in a small dimensions, the British research project in observation of the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>

<seg id="1540">There regularly breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Although there is an natural look, and we have a direct link to climate change, the iron plate is now available in a dangerous position, "said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">It is the most popular retreat since the beginning of the records, "he also confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">It is controversial, whether the Larsen-C-Schelstrom and may go back again, and may be summarized, "said his colleague Adrian Luckman," said: "our models tell that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this trend will last for decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if this researcher did not lead to climate change, which have not lead to climate change, so in the past decades, there are very many icolines of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant in recent years had been exposed to climate change impacts, who has much less rain in spring and much more in the fall.</seg>

<seg id="1805">Solutions that are drawn into account, are a better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation of the ground, but also the spray of the plants with a protective mixture of tone and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dry resistant.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">A staff of the weekly magazine Riodoce will take part in order to verify their plans for the reporting on the youngest chaos in the state of Sinaloa, organised by the organized crime, corrupt officials and undeclining drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on this day, in the shadow of its own tragedy, they came together to speak about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was informed that it is important to change their routine.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more feel: they should take their children with the office, who were to leave the goal of a attack on grenades, or at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, associations.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporter, name for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug pmuggler, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected, on the secret of the government or the Kartelle, a catalogue of criminals, who make the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no representation of violence, throughout all the country, and throughout the country the bodies were driven by President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012. 589 are standing following attacks and threats under Bundesschutz und until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Under the last one, her publisher and their inspirator of Riodoce, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">The biggest error is to live in Mexico and journalist, "Valdez, in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">His place is highly recommended, although its presence is present - a big photo of Valdez, who love his middle with the Riodoce building. two reporter at the Riamirez's façade, carry T-Shirts, the face of his face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their divided themes, the grape of grape, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Even though 2010, a Sonder Attorney's Office was established to work with the cases of journalists, according to the committee for the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of Morden, who are associated with drug trading and organised crime are associated, the mortar of journalists is only rare before court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they are still not considered to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although it is untrunces, even though the terrain is still hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without any information about mortar, without justice, has a meeting about the discussion of safety, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very dummy, my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the Warum, we do not know any."</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks away, before his red Toyota Corolla was forced by two men before his car was forced to wait for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - the "twelve" river. "</seg>
<seg id="1830">The scarves in its car is gone and damaged in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors, rumors, in Culiacan are free to fly in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez, there are practically nothing as silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">For Guzmans, last year and extradition to the United States in January and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the whole blood fields of the country because rivaled Frations are struggling to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It makes nothing that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people on the road are shot, or that the cemetery full is fully decorated, two-story-story mouse-oleen in the drug, which are bigger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">For a minute that there is a state of "tranquility," If only a carton the control of the state of governmental organisation with its valuable harbours and drugs in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of his work, Isak Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, who is broken with the debt of the blood that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two abuse have contributed to the murder of murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">Initially in February the publication of a interviews with Damaso Lopez, a leader in one of the rivaled carton tions in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have troubled to the sons, said the gangmembers purchased every copy of the edition, once they delivered on newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake had not to become Valdez, in Valdez, after the confiscation of a other newspaper, the same history, the country had to leave the country at his own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its murder is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived, that his friends, and colleagues, that he would always be since.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was in 2003 as a experienced reporter for Noroeste when he joined Riodoce with five colleagues in the founding of Riodoce and sold more than 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism, without having to hit the low-poison problem," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">With the time, the newspaper served a reputation of the mute and honest reporting, and revenues and advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter that thrilled, hard to publish some fear in censorship, and the reader were fascinated by a publication, in which they could read stories, the nobody could handle any less.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Mary-Moors-Cabot-Prize" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Award' of the Committee of journalists for his courage in prosecuting the Mexican drug history, where she also led them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily to that he had fear.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to live on" I wanted to live at the time of CPJ-award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trade in Sinaloa, is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV in October last October.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you need to take over the task that falls to you as journalist - either or play the Duma.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I would not want to be asked: "what you did you did in view of many deaths... why hast thou hast taken what you went?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team measures Valdez, the fun-bird that could happen like a dockworkers, a friend, which was generously up, was a teacher who knew what man survived.</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trusted and trusted upon their routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always be to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, go there and always at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now ask them: was his love to routine use?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death, she also forced to ask their own request to question their own request, as they can do their work on life and life at the life.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"you don't know if you want to move with her women, their children, their clean shops, their home start and runways," in order to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-riding and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">With its own instinkable trust.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If there is wrong, wl away, and away from there.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble, said the Editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "smell is a sense that will be interpreted... and then it is the thing with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">In Sinaloa, the old rules, such as he and other states are not in Sinaloa, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which an toxic mixture of lucrative rouge, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape has changed continuously.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room, in which the employees of Riodoce met for security training, suddenly there was no mobile phones. days previously unknown that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, is used for monitoring of journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside they looked for two policemen protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a construction.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a mid-size district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in shear, some of the reporter whether these officers are among the 50 percent of policemen, who does not recognize the governor itself as a trusted.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months later, since the reporter that went to the Berglare, where the drug policies de facto into account under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has made three main stories on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the former owner Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the government spending, which concentrated on the home of the governor of the Governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">There was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, an block away from the office of the state, an abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about how it was kidnapped, or how it was to write the particular caution than it was time to write what every one in the city knows that the restaurant is a favourite locally of drug traders and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned about public records that the restaurant under the name of a political player has been registered under the name of a political revolution Party (PRI), which reigned almost all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Several PRI governors were adopted several PRI governors for high-quality cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">In Villarreal, Villarreal, reporters, about predictions in this locality are writing, among them one, in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman went to a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months previously, the reader were awarded by Valdez as the best informed source about the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we saw already that happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO." due to its slender body.</seg>
<seg id="1885">All channels of the communication with our sources are broken by now. "</seg>
<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez was dedicated to storage space for signs and stickers, which is dedicated to the Morde of journalists, because the employees have become something that they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez Snappended a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of a further journalists to the Office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and civil servants, based on DNA tests that it is of it.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In the whole country, journalists has become stronger, by taking part in the Protest "SOS Press," due to and constructions.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On this day, the director of Bojorquez weg in Washington is trying to collect international support for the Justice in the fall of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accusing the authorities, asked journalists and bring them to bring them because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has been asked since then that it is redivided by the government, because it is worried that their anger is violated their lens.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico of organised crime committed to the government officials and the same society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote, reporters not only killed by drug policies, but also on the order of political parties and security forces, which organized a organized crime under a ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="1896">According to the media group "Articulo 19" the media group "Articulo 19" last year more than half of the attacks were assigned to the police and officials.</seg>
<seg id="1897">In Mexico face, because she would like to know that you have the mouth conditions, "said Ramirez.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Apparently, Morde has obviously a terrible effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one came to the death of the Blogist Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border of Tamaulipse before six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Your body was found together with a note that was reportedly signed by the Zetas cartridge: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones are besides her with separate heads.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border of Chihuahua, after the assassination of Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others, like it El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug papal with a leading articles on the front page with the heading "What would you like to take us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists are fled from their home or even out of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and seek to dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are going to wait until the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was assassinated along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, after three months after the escape from Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="1909">For those who return to work and continue work, it is a daily dance with risk-risk decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Ibarra, who once he wanted to be poets, gives the drug that reckt it.</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and therefore I was reporter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="1912">Around midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editorial team of Riodoce was on the pavement before the office and drank beer, as at once all their phones started.</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of paintings with bandenrivals and security forces near the town of Mazatlan had left the dead in 19.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war broke out, as it was promised by a number of Kartell messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">They released the news on the site of Riodoce about mobile phone on the site of Riodoce.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The title page had to be changed on the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens, sirens near to - a further sliding doors in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez, threw a view of the policemen who held the guard to see whether they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">If they had not fear at all, they showed it not.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Under the massive portrait of the fallen of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose midfinger was visible in Sinaloa, followed by the collaborators of Riodoce his tracks.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As you can also do you think about it, "said Bojorquez," when the same day, to be murdered by Javier, the practitioners for me to send me to the road. "</seg>

<seg id="1924">Now researchers found that the first findings of the incredible Nashorns was so well received, that experts have described as "Mona Lisa by Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so good that they could even be discovered that its white skin of reddish Braun was told - and they said, she would have had something of a "unquiet past."</seg>

<seg id="1928">His unbelievably good original condition has researchers who had it as a really remarkable "describe and astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the gearing plant was the best preserved Fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn funk when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray, in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something like what happened from the surrounding rocks at the Platze, and decided to take more accurate.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years, the wild animal within the 2,500 Pound (1,100 kg) heavy-proof stables.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all of these hard work, the ready result is ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only have a little familiar with the eyes-blind, you could not believe that it is," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs individuals - Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs is one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs individuals. "</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this plant was covered, although it is similar to a stirring, and is similar to a convertible tank, probably from the flesh, and threatened by meat.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly gepanzed Dinosaurs used a red and white camoust to hide himself, and used a paratrotechnique which is known as counterpart, that is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have been better to mix better in his surroundings and his delicacy, say experts, what indicates that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature made from the Nodosaurs family made the headlines in May for the first time and is now shown at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have studied wild animal and studying Borealopelta markchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing maintenance of the specimen came to Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the patterns and the form of polls and armaments over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the concessions, an important defence method in the animal, which means that the top of the creature is darker than their underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the concession is usual, the results are surprisingly, since the size of Borealopelta are by far the amount of living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the Dinosaurs was sufficient to lack of sufficient pressure by meat and send Dinosaurs. evolution, the evolution of the confrontation was favored as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals, who are to go to RPM, Zebul, or Gürteleals - are much smaller and violate as prey source, which was exposed to a real struggle against that Nodosaurs was exposed to a real struggle.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "strong smoking behaviour in a massive, strongly gearing dinosaurs, how to have been dangerous the dinosaurs of the chalk-animals to have been" said Brown "said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scalen shows that the skin of the dinosaur is rotated.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal on information about his life, including its conserving fourth Darminent, to figure out what it was eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the Dinosaurs is, when he died, into a river and in the sea, where he fell on the back to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">On this time, Alberta was as warm as south florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much more landscape than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurs is really remarkable because it is completely covered with conspicuous skin for it, but also in three dimensions, the original form of the Shelter," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal today looks like in the early Creta time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you only have a little bit with the eyes, you could believe that it is at bedtime. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when a huge Theropods, successively send Dinosaurs, which went on two legs to turn the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaur Rex, died million years after Borealopelta, was the geared Dinosaurs in some of his furmiter ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This is the Acrocanthosaur, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Scientists who appear to be the latest findings in the journal-Biology magazine, believe that Borealopelta believe in the sea and burnt down in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn funk when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray, in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the preserved dinosaurs in the world, including skin and armour, and is completely covered by the Schnauze to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures, on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and have to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that were added by its shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the gearing plant was wed by the Western Canada, until a flooded river in the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the underwater facilities of the Dinosaur is protected against an exquisite detail in an exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">At least the remnants of this special specimen are so well received that the skin's still climbing up to the dinosaur plates along the dinosaur.</seg>

<seg id="1992">But the times of the interruptions are soon past.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn testet currently underway the hard drive control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">One confirms simply by phone that one can be taken by his place and does the travel card.</seg>
<seg id="1995">At present, a test run is at two distances.</seg>
<seg id="1996">We offer the offer to a wide range of products.</seg>
<seg id="1997">Then, at the beginning of the next year, it will be available for many further remote routes in Germany, "said a train speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort check-in" calls the ticket of the ticket evaluation without work.</seg>
<seg id="1999">However, to use this, however, some requirements are fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to booked an online ticket - what should already do most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">You must also have purchased the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is the comfortable kind of the ticket sales.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last, you need a seating set.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Because the "comfort check-in" works as: you rises in the train, call his driver's ticket under "Meine tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">When the test customers appears to be a button for the testing time.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train managers get a message on their mobile devices a message that passenger is located in the train and the gebooked seats in Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Coming from the train guide, the train head is at number Y knows that there is a passenger online ticket with an online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can sleep to sleep, further, further, further.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, use one for the train - what to the passengers take advantage of the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"those who want to travel without a ticket control through our train staff, I am simply feel free in the DB Navigator.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This enables the passengers to make your travel time in the train of personal, "says Michael Peterson, Marketing-Management of DB remote traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second Plus: "and our employees have more time than today to enter individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those often take train, knows that in addition to delay and missed trains to the largest doctors, are among the greatest doctors.</seg>
<seg id="2013">For often, however, if one of the check-out did not work any documents that you need to use the online tickets for the use of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the number of reference clock or otherwise a document that you must show.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train managers and passenger, which leads to worse on worse and delays in the control of your own tickets and the work at the end time, to take care of other forms.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Even only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And this is only available on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Other train numbers on the same route are not unlocked.</seg>
<seg id="2019">As an activist, the answer came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken by its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only one day after they arrived in New York City, the church was sitting in St. Louis Geborene on the bed of a Airbnb apartment, that they rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">You are proud about a post of somebody from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">The police has just killed an 18 year old child, and there is still on the road "called it there.</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused, since no one didn't know anything else on your Feed, the information received Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was continually updated continuously on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The Rapper, from the territory of St. Louis, was the death of Michael Brown, an armed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policemen in Ferguson, Mo., killed live too.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He postete a picture by Browns leblosem body, which was punched out on the road and would stay four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's a wild," thought of Ferrell. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But the death was nothing new for them and her community nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="2030">It put your cell phone in order to return on the evening to Tweets on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos from the police band and people, and out of a man who claimed to be his sign, to be a sign with the inscription: "Fergusons police had just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live Feed, where a policeman, in front of a group of protesters with a bellishing dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she told them, a other policeman, and cried: "I will kill you..." animals all kill. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," that Ferrell went to her statement.</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the species of murder, to which we call us and that we call for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2036">This moment I felt Schüttela.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and weeping. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You book a return flight and went home to the next day after home.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from their father's house and decided that the two next morning would drive to Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss of resistance, strength and strength of resistance, which consists of people from the point of people who live in the community and the roads have to challenge answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As a herell with her daughter, who had an Flower and a matching crown, after Ferguson, the two was a conversation, that they had countless times in front of this morning "about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"You know that, as I taught you, when black people have to fight for the fight, what they believe in?" reminded it of what they said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">Now we go to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year old boy, and that was not right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">I couldn't take it to take it, "said Ferrell later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happened today, is a high point of its... what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">You need to know it and be it in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we do have to do so free to liberate ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even though I have experienced the luck to give you a experience that personally did not experienced a eklatant racism, it is not different as the next black female child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I have the feeling, I would give you a bad service, they keep them away. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station when they arrived in Ferguson Road, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place compared to the police station, which became a camp on the potential of the possible non-accusation of Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There have been Ferrell and her daughter together with a local business partner, the lunch made.</seg>
<seg id="2053">You have prepared bags and mix them to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly it started to accept a new kind of activity for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">After August 9, total, "my activism have changed," said they said that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Association of Nurses Association and focused on Food and Health in black municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">I had no experience in the organiser.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come to all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later Ferrell met Ferrell during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the movie.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said, she and her Camera Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to document the "documentary" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came to the sense: "want to document the document or trying to find a story that you can use it?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This Skepsis was nourished by countless cases of people, often from White - in a community which benefited from their pain and its resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As folayan recently declared in an interview: "we heard that people who are born in Ferguson and grew up and raised their voices, and we wanted to do it different."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, a artist from the area that is known for his activism around Todestract occupations.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell's project, together with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years to Browns.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or with us. we speak," said Davis. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main reason for me, as these people are represented, because the people will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on fermented experience - in order to show that it is not a Messiah guide, but in order to become a community, "said folayan - she proved to be the obvious participants in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, the documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of feres life, as they loves to marches their wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">I felt like the naked, "said Ferrell and lapping when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I understand that there was a certain damage to be found in this work and for the human being of black people."</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrealizes is repeated the role of black pregnant women in the wider Black-Lives-movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, which according to the execution of the black teenager Trayby Martin in 2012 was minted the film "BlacklivesMatter" in 2012, identifies as pregnant as pregnant.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Black, pregnant with women in managerial positions have carried out the movement, "said Ferrell," and therefore we fight it constantly on various fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, pregnant coil women must have to carry the main last of all. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan voted to notice that "the movement really kept really fine of black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it is insisted that "this is no incompatible type of action," at Ferrell was chosen as a heart of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who made these energy," said it. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">It's no coincidence, although it was at pre-front front, as a black, pregnant with woman so much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can pick up their energy by the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile the news release of Ferguson has been gone long, but the racial connections between the community and police are still rising.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is located in currency, for 2 ½ years because of blockage of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home: "a Chaos". "</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless they had to perform a singing and they feels committed to this memory, since then they went on the road three years ago in Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our requirement to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our user to win.</seg>

<seg id="2089">The Bit gallery moves the people, although it is not built for long.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping center on the south of the pedestrian precinct since the first presentation 2009 the population is in support and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The theme has hardly one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The subject will also be discussed at the "Volksfreund Bitburg" Facebook page. "</seg>
<seg id="2093">During one-bit gallery: "this would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This would be a dream" (Nicole Schausten), coming from the other side: "we don't need any man" (Siggi Bright) or simply's simple: "size wahn!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the advocate in advocates that a gallery attracts more customers in the city, of which the other business profit also benefit, that the pedestrian precurges of the pedestrian zone could benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned to offer exactly on the premises, on which the peasant market hall is to offer their products in 13 directors.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction works there will be a conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Galerie Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - precisely to the Beda square with possibility to seats outside the seats.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we buy now for almost a week in the farmer's market hall for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the Blessed Virgin are always liked very happy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We have discovered the butcher shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that, during, and above all after the construction of the gallery, there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also the same.</seg>
<seg id="2103">The small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether directors is market for market in a Markthalle in the gallery, arrives at the height of the rental.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The new project probably should not be too low for the new project.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "the shopping centre in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drauties or supermarkets: I find the superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough to us in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One sees how many cargo shops can be empty here - some since months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But there is not even a ordinary weekly market, there are all the more important to get to the market hall at least the market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because anyway, the product is made of fresh, mostly directly from the producers, and is purely inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shop stores in a shopping mall will be rented solely of larger companies, because they are not portable for a single dealer often not portable.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Schade, special shops, there are almost no longer and that of which is still left, then will disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a mall with a Markthalle fits all together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where is the peasant market hall during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EdeKA would be the solution - even on duration if the Bit Gallery is actually coming out sometime.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or if it creates the Gespenst-Gallery, all stores from Bitburg will be able to distribute all shops in Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "this is simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center, which stands empty, no one needs no one.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my view, it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market, instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But it is necessary for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the amazing many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg there is no place.</seg>
<seg id="2123">If the farm market hall is made, we will disappear again a piece of culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the smoking of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces of faces - white, black and brown, which hanging itself almost invisible - the ceiling of the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, from Wangen-Tupfern and Haarlem that you have been sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from prison by Fort Leavenworth where the former secret services analyser had a 35-year prison sentence, after she made public diplomatic messages via the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resurry (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline took its competence in technology, computer science and art, and she was the condemnation of Barack Obama, was called by Barack Obama, when he was only three days in his position.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg originated out through the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which could look like someone with these genomic DNA data - the many ways to be interpreted as they can be interpreted as they are interpreted, and the inherent Determinism of this interpretations - but also to the identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward born, but has been found guilty of his buffer: for the identification of his death, he was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for 20 trials, including six pieces against the spionage Act, computer was and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">By the prison, her image was suppressed, so that there was only a single photo - a liqueurs, black-white selfie, in the creing is confident of a driver's seat, and has been associated with which she was associated with them.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came just from the great success of their 2012-project 'beach Visions. "</seg>
<seg id="2134">This is the artist portrait of foreign part of artistry, including cigarette blmel and Kaugmented, by creating the DNA from the waste, in order to create a picture of which the people could look like these people.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when they received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">In prison, "she created an interview with Chelsea, and she wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article" declared Dewey-Hagborg.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And they could not be visited at this time, and they could not be photographed on Chelsea, so that they wanted to make contact with Chelsea and asked them to make it a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and incarcerated Muse were interceptible to Brieffer, which had several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They need even a summary of Shooting Kanungo illustrated comic book "Suppressed images," who saw a future prediction, in which the President of the United States would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was indeed just a few days after the book was released, Mannings release after seven additional years ago in a military prison in Kansas, was a dramatic kind of goodbye to the reunion.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also a little because in the opening of the exhibition, because Donald Trump leads a war against informant from the government camp and against transformatting troops to find new, to be re-capable to solve the starters, which he is supposed to be too bad.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg, after the strange Timing of all these things was asked, she said that "things happen that" things from a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery, the teams called up with their oversized signature, among them (the "i" in their family name) an end of "automatic smashing principle, whose foundation of sex, race, sexuality and culture have been"</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, the mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As was written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg, hoping through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific Encyclopedia of the artist) how amazing, at least in biologically, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people do not take care of things that our genome is not responsible for a interpretation and as subjective data," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, also can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition that is kept in a separate room, is one side from the top mentioned comic Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning, as it appears with a release man in the hand of the United States, such as King-Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they're talking your speech, then they won," means it. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"" "says the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"" "it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me," said the artist that has been living in Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="2153">"" I get still to see, if I talk about. "</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has never seen the exhibition yet - as it was prevalent in the comic book - but if it should do it, then it will be greeted in the middle of the space of masks, from their own genomatic simulator, which like hormones are merged with protagonist.</seg>
<seg id="2155">It was also targeted as everything in the exhibition until the size of the size (5 "2, Mannings Stature), where their genetic haplogroups had been written with pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a human being, "said Dewey-Hagborg.</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted to feels like a mass movement that feels like a mass movement that was formed with Chelsea, as the movement that came out behind her liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on one archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection which was inspired by documents in the British library - a project that he expected unexpectedly.</seg>
<seg id="2297">I have written only to the thumb pressure on the side of a letter which was written by a double-year in the 1700-th years, who worked for the Jakobiner, "he says.</seg>

<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that it will not be wacked by 2017, a new report is in the technological developments in the field of sex robot.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex-robot are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University Sheffield as well as co-founder of the FRR, we must start to start their ascent.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its form of breast wardze and the type of fingerning.</seg>
<seg id="2395">People who make people talk about it, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will get much more often to see how Sharkey said to the release of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sinks have developed from their inflatable partners to robot with a silicon concave that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions, which can be achieved through the artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust his robot also according to his products "and thereby choose from the eye-color of the robot via the form of chest strap up to type or paint of its fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it is still alive because many robots, the "personalities," who would like to look like a Stepford's wife.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexports have developed to robot with a silicone conjunctiva.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example to adapt to its users to adapt its robots to the properties, which they tend to find like for example.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the true Companion of the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which brings the impression of relentness and "wild Wendy" with a "abentage" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality written by your personality as well as possible," warms the website of true Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So'd like to like what you like, and they do not like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, you also have their voting - quite as real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">It may seem to be tired to be fixed on the sunk or can be "in mood"! "</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many beatible aspects during this rise of sex robot - not least because they replace true human relations - but the undering female properties, however, if one step on Frigid (is here: resisting) Farrah, Beunquiet one at most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website, True Life on Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibration, why can do not have any Roxxxy?" says it on the site.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robot is not only a fever or maintenance only a different Sexchanges.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Raw meat, dairy products and chocolate could help, IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Raw meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system as a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claimed on the contrary: a diet, rich in meat-based protein and dairy products, could improve symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The unhealed condition which affects approximately CHF 1.3 million in the United States, causes thies and bubbles, recurring or bloodshed, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During the person concerned, meat and dairy products used to reach their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan caused by proteins that promote immune cells to develop a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The Chief researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared to ensure the immune cells in the intestine patrol to ensure that the microalgae are hidden in the food, not in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells, which are able to be able to prevent inflammation of cells, which protect the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far away in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance of the immune cell in mice is found that a particular bacterium in their initiate.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins in order to terminate the identity of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterium species - Lactobacillus Coteri - which is a normal part of the intestine microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">According to more tryptophan the mice in their food, the more had these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He proposed that the combination of L. Kteri and an tryptophan varied diet tolerances, less than inflammatory intestinal functions, when the same system also do with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan run a kind of immune cell that had found that a group of study proteins such cells, but had a group of the same stem, which was separated, but it was not separated, this had not separated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They believed to do the difference with the intestinal microbious of mice, the community of bacteria, viruses and mushroom, which normally live in the stomach-intestinal Trakt.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The derivatives of the mice was detected DNA sequenced and were found six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells, but without they were missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were drawn up in a sterile environment, so that they were not developed by the intestinal microbiome and they were developed to L. reuteri and the immunity cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria could be found on the immune system, researchers L. Kteri found a liquid in a liquid and then carried out small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria, which were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immunocells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component from the liquid has been cleaned, it proved to be used as a secondary product of tryptophan-Metabolism, that is known as an Indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If researchers have doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells fell by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people had the same tolerant cells such as mice and that most of us L. reuteri protect us in our stomach-intestine traders.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known that Tryptophan-annex-products from L. reuteri found cells in people as in mice but defects were found in relation to tryptophan in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "the development of these cells is probably a bit that we want to promote these cells on the inner surface of Darms.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potential may lead to high tryptophan values in the presence of L. Kteri as an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2637">But that's why everything will not be true, "seavior, a SPD electoral, when Friday afternoon the new Hiobsbanned the party's headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Stephan Weil, SPD-Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands on the role of the green MPs Elke Twests for CDU without their own government.</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the temporary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And no one knows what next comes next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The missions began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March.</seg>
<seg id="2642">A blue eye, more did not have the comrades in a stone time.</seg>
<seg id="2643">According to the annual general election in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, all in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2644">It was then even worse - in fact everything was worse - even worse.</seg>
<seg id="2645">The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the Taumess, the Düsseldorf-Pleite Party.</seg>
<seg id="2646">Work in the weeks afterwards, comrades fell back to the weeks afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2647">Then, when they had just had new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="2648">And with him the next lowers came back.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD-Landeschef, lost the last weekend of Nimbus, because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burnt down.</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because he is in the crisis of the crisis, so quite everything made it wrong, which you can do it wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Since then, Scholz fights about its political survival.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Now, Stephan Weil, so now also Stephan Weil, too.</seg>

<seg id="2654">Miese refraction are added.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Nevertheless, or perhaps just therefore, he tried to put more stronger in the Bund accents for the past few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2656">The bestowed of the former mayor of Hanover, his power in Berlin, was also hidden in the environment by Martin Schulz.</seg>
<seg id="2657">They left him, because they spoke of for stabilise the party.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Now, the exact opposite could occur.</seg>
<seg id="2659">In the residential building of the Lower Saxony, the Lower Saxon Greens does not contain any debt due to this meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2660">And Mr Schulz don't know yet.</seg>
<seg id="2661">In order to stay, the comrades is therefore closed to keep the own rows.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Your wrath is aimed at the countryside, and here especially on the abrallnige Pararierin Twesten.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"it is unbearable and democratic, like Mrs. Twests of their own carrots for the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, chief of the party left in the SPD-Bundestag, the editorial network of Germany (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2664">Mrs. Twests is not elected to the parliament as a director of the Lower Saxony, but also elected the state of Lower Saxony, as the Lower Saxony's Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The logical consequence, it would be, that she gives her Mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thomas Oppermann, chief of the SPD-Bundestag, accused of a "undemocratic manoeuvre."</seg>
<seg id="2667">For four years ago the Wählerwille was clear: the man have made Stephan Weil to prime minister, "says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony as a top candidate in the Bundestag on the RND.</seg>
<seg id="2668">"now, the personal cartoons of a future CDU MPs," said Oppermann, "said Oppermann."</seg>

<seg id="2716">Green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when President of the board was on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American development programmes.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior officials for the White House made a round tour of products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopters was presented in Connecticut with a yacht from Maine, an firemen of Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The military office of the White House designed the presence of helicopters in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMx-1), which is responsible for the operation of helicopters.</seg>
<seg id="2720">I wanted to make sure that you are aware of it, because it is a unusual event with a high visibility, "wrote the comur of the HMx-1 on the eve of the event to the deputy of the Deputy Commander of the aviation industry.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The news revealed that the helicopter was taken in the morning at 7 o'clock in the morning at the South of Lawn for the event, and so long until the lawn between 18: 00 and 21: 00 clock in this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">Note that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limitation of service hours a second team would be required for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">During the event, the original airplanes were found during the helicopters, while the unit remained at the ground during the time on the ground at the plane.</seg>
<seg id="2724">The records provided that the TIME were not clear if there was a second flight format was required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act offers the Federal Government to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Data sets show that HMx-1 has asked for the event to prevent the event.</seg>
<seg id="2727">A question that we ordered, whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts, and we were informed that this is not the case, "wrote the commander.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Sounds as if you are sealed, "said the deputy commander.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America," the White House was called the official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have policy-tones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">On the event, the President gave a sign for the reform of health reform, which was in the Senate in the Gange, and he was implicated the efforts to win in the government of the government.</seg>

<seg id="2737">HMx-1 occupying forces often lead training flights in the area around Washington and the South Lawn in order to add the US President in the White House with precise centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="2738">When Trump was at the beginning of July at the G20 summit in Germany, HMx-1 took place in the White House 58 workouts.</seg>

<seg id="2742">A speaker by Sikorsky said that the company would not have been involved in the South Lawn at the South of Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMx-1 maintains no Buddy drawings for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost for the event.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen Report report by Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report reports about the abuse of weathered Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">The author and historian Michael Hesemann is the author of the author and historian Michael Eemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the Missy scandal plaguing the Domensburger Domsplitter continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Blattner, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," stated by the former Regensburger Bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be the prestige of the Catholic Church very serve, when Mueller and Ratzinger had their deepest on their own signature or at that time the false estimation of the processes would be press.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" on the other hand criticized that in the reporting on violence in the Domspatzen station, "was measured.</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the overgrips in Regensburg, no one has to be prevented in order to be prevented in the future, however, the "degree of medial manipulation." thus the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the accused, the Catholic Church as the source of all plague, is already part of the everyday experience and prepares the public opinion that said for normal," writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">In an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk, the Gloria of Thurn and taxis said, said, "we would like to go on the church and it is a few minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2898">In addition she pointed out that in their youth, "a very well-known pedagogical means" was to be done to be done with great children, as I was one of his youth. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair, today's standards on previous decades, because the world have changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports of the reports about the missive cases, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger was often used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who translated with Ratzinger memorandum from the book "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "because all that had nothing to do with him," the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What is exactly what exactly stands in the 440-page report that presented by the diocese of Regensburg (Ulrich Weber)?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were carried out between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high Plausibly" victim of overflow, 67 Domspatzen sexual sexually abuses.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is called Georg Ratzinger who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "in summary, so that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Even in high emotional functionality, the irradiation could also be recirradiation for the pupils also.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other restrictions, many victims of the general rule of R. estimating and therefore, in numerous cases, despite being a positive memories of him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In an interview, Hesemann, why the final report for the abuse of power was given to the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report about the "incidents of the violence of violence in the Domensburger Domspatzen" there is a contradictory image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For a lift, many students welcomed his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it appears as a choleriker and perfecomist, who was much more brilliant, when a Domspatz had no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How to check out this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if one read the trouble, and all the 440 pages long report from the front to the behind, you have to ask, why the name Georg Ratzinger is found at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">It is just eight pages dedicated to him, and he is clearly acquitted from any suspicion of the Mittal or co-leader in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The non-violence school at the pre-school event took place outside of its effect.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can clarify Him that could learn about late or first disclose it enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzengymnasium, in which he worked for almost all respondents in order to be taken literally - "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus, the vast majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger describes a very well-known witness, "competent," competent, "competent teacher, who plays the guys with cakes, cookies and Bonbons, and had been seized by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Just a minority worth just over his perfism and its high emotional ality, which led to Wutout.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only threw with chairs on the ground, but even earns against the hair and ears, even earthly matters to the hair or ears, he has even been abandoned even before years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, he has to be confused, however, that such education methods must be spread in the days of the 1960s, the 1960s and 1970s, they were widespread, with parents such as teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know yet to know such counseling methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course I think everyone from us, who was born in 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced that in a world-school school, experienced a state-school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what a report is actually written in this report, namely the sexual abuse of sexual abuse and the violence of violence in the primary school, the free Bagatellen were.</seg>
<seg id="2926">There is no matter whether it is not even with his friend and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, so many media has just over him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian State of Pope, many who never understood him never, still eifrig.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report of the lave Georg Ratzinger report in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media context this report was reported to report a lot about the topic of abuse at the Domensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">With regard to sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger will also be used in terms of sexual abuse during sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual interns claims to have become a domain master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">I never take up my father with my father, or my mother. "he said to talk about my father," said, "said all very peiny."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem at the information of sexual abuse was, however, is that most of the victims of Sham.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they don't have her parents and siblings, then all of the choral conductors, but he would have been unable to have been able to have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How this is the Domspatzen pupils Ratzinger's role in regard to the ablivities?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a fragmented pupils formulated this: "regarding sexual abuse... I see no case, in which he could have had precedence (Georg Ratzinger).</seg>
<seg id="2939">I do it... even for really absurd, accept that it would be more quickly and clear or even more, when compared to their parents, internatants, confidentials, confidentists, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">"" "" he speaks with him about sex... - hours. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">Thus, the report on the quite clear result: "that would not be aware of the prior-out students and / or their environment could not be confirmed as part of the study."</seg>
<seg id="2942">What do sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus working from everyone to discuss.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus, it can't be charged with him, not prevented him or to have brought him.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to bring his good name with these resisted crimes in connection as it was unfortunately in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media was much of "violence exzessen" to read the Domensburger Domspatzen. "</seg>
<seg id="2946">The earlier domain of Georg Ratzinger will be charged with the earlier domain of Georg Ratzinger report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he must live with this design?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the great problem that in the coverage of all mixed and mentions it was removed from sexual abuse of sexual abuse and violence in the middle of the middle, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly that, in turn, is a abuse of report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a clean separately between the school and the Gymnasium of the Domspatzen station, between sexual abuse and non-violence and non-violence.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral head of the Domspatzen station.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrifying test education, cases, in which the boys of sadist teachers were painted and, among them were meant to have suffered at the school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really skandalous states have to have gone.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those who had Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger didn't do anything, because he got the boys only to face, when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On the same way, as the very witness of the witness, the theme "Preschool" tableu. "</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to be coming to his and genoss the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was unlike the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: as a result of discipline, but no sadisticker violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that "many victims of the General Assembly of R. estimating and therefore, in numerous cases, despite being a positive memories of him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most of the preset, not even the predator, not to have stowed away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report was able to define two time rooms, in which he was reported by the states on the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he started to establish itself, and from the processes on a school, which he was not working and responsible (so the witness) didn't hear anything, and then again in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Georg Ratzinger closed out the ears of the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which was even produced in 1989.</seg>
<seg id="2964">It is therein all this point, "that in the pre-school school, the test penalty will be practiced."</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the risk of negative pressurprises, he was a result of the risk of disease worsening.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, as a legal consequences, as it was forbidden in Bavaria since it was forbidden in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they occurred in a legal grey zone, as everyone from us probably still knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also difficult for him to estimate that the affected may have been exceeded, or drafting, and where the permissible limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say it, he would have been shy.</seg>
<seg id="2970">It's true not.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria in 1980.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Füry Gloria of Thurn and taxis maintained, it is unfair to turn today's pedagogical standards in the time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we talked to talk given from the "Fallstrick of the Anachronism," thus the danger of past, past today's moral dimensional.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The Füry has already quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is of course not the most important abuse of sexual abuse, which was broken off to all times, and violence at unschool children. it was broken that already far beyond that time, it's not far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's everything very terrible and I am glad that it's finally worked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all that had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means to identify and irradiation, thus earns in the hair and ears to move to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Then, as a physical activity, he was banned as a physical activity.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What Picture from his regensburger time, Georg Ratzinger wrote for the discussions with you for the book "My brother of Pope" ""?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the subject of testing also to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Eemann: now, in the book it goes to the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, as the Domspatzen played only one side.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I didn't understand that there was a stricter regiment.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even though this would have to be said that time: without these perfism, it would be hardly possible to become a member of world-known regensity known as a cultural heritage of Europe and his musical tradition which went twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and Bonbons alone you would like to resist the boys now no big singer and before any success, right in which the area, but discipline, passion and self-windowns.</seg>
<seg id="2987">As what for a man you have experienced Georg Ratzinger at the discussions with their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Eemann: due to work on the book and beyond, I've met Georg Ratzinger really met again and again, in humorous, humorous, deep breath and warm good people, from which one could do not have to do something like a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regularly with how many former Domspatzen still exists today, 23 years after his empiriot, regularly paid contact with him, "he is almost blind and him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who don't awarded him to today, that he was once a strictly limited to them, are therefore clear in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most domain extensions are grateful for him today that it has enriches her life and to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always had a good, fathers, and a certain father, a certain that may be, but may be there - but also a lovely values in response to it was still looking down to it.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again, once again: everything that we used to look, are educators, who were at the same time in the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We may be happy that we have overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is extremely odd right, a man only because he is prominently and a prominent brother to make the medial sin bock.</seg>
<seg id="2996">Since the evil intention is evil, which stands behind it, is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report, which was just released, is lave him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now anyone would have acquired a 93-year-old man who has acquired large merits, and perhaps there is no one no one to get the Regensburger Domspatzen station, finally, in peace in peace.</seg>
