Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid de
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tur@@ ni@@ ers in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a bit di@@ version with some colleagues on the beach .
there was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old man .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after some minutes , the horses were rec@@ eded to her holiday , they hunt for the fast Gal@@ lo@@ p in the fast Gal@@ lo@@ p .
a kilometer at this pace , I have had fear .
it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and this ended the riding career then again .
on Saturday , Germany , the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament wins - is very close to horses by horse riding .
he left with his family on the premises of the AL@@ RV , on a horse @-@ schw@@ ang he did not walk to photography .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus at CH@@ IO at CH@@ IO .
the reason was very convincing .
the German sports aid presented the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala called the Golden Sport@@ pyramid .
there is no doubt one of the pleasant sport@@ s@@ men .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions Tour Player of the year ...
even the British Queen took him already .
long 18th winner of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this award means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because they will not only be awarded for sporty successes , but also for social commitment . &quot;
since decades , Lan@@ ger supports the offspring .
and so he gave the prize money of 25.000 Euro equal to the prize money of 25.000 Euro .
with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ time master mast winner was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports . &quot;
among these events are the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ dium and Harald Schmit@@ t , the founder Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the father of Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the Ju@@ oka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the leader of Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously donated the hand@@ b@@ aller .
many of these sports were come on Saturday to Aachen .
after the official part of the illustri@@ ous society in the Spring@@ stadi@@ on , where the Lav@@ azza Prize ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger maintained a distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tru@@ mps Economic Policy in comparison : IT &apos;s all about the money
in infrastructure , in infrastructure and the trade agreements of T@@ TP - this would like to be Clinton as well as Tru@@ mp .
however , the two U.S. presidential elections are however , however , at the tax and energy policy as well as in a landmark case .
the differences in the economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hillary Clinton is a general , rather philosophi@@ cal difference .
the , about the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to keep the doub@@ ts in doubt and war@@ ns against the state of the economy , with taxes and regulation .
Clinton to death Clinton to death and to death , he says .
in other words , it would have quite different , claims , Tru@@ mp .
he will re@@ trac@@ ed by massi@@ vely , and he makes for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates strongly - for businesses and businesses .
Clinton said : the state has certain tasks to open up and needs to open the disabled chances and needs to open money .
therefore , the taxes would increase for the matur@@ ation , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the infrastructure .
in the one that , Tru@@ mp and Clinton is almost identical .
the democratic candidates in announces , the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state capital programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are rejected by the nation@@ alist Te@@ gel wings of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so , on Tru@@ mp could give an additional internal start of discussions .
significant differences are significant in the energy and climate policy .
Tru@@ mp will build coal plants and drive the coal plants in the USA again .
oil extraction should also be possible to cancel the Paris Climate protection agreement to all date of the Paris Climate protection agreement .
Clinton intends to expand its renewable energy program with their investment program . &quot; a country will be able to create the Super@@ renewable energies , and millions of jobs . &quot;
it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want to say that we are . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even with international trade agreements , the two competitors are not far away from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ os@@ fish trade agreements , do not want to sign .
at the same time , both the USA are not allowed to isol@@ ate the international trading , but simply to American jobs better .
those should then be paid for better , about Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars was a famine .
it wants to increase them to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tru@@ mp can do in this question do is not clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ ye , then he says , he will not be changed .
however , the big discussion of the coming month is likely to develop , rather in order to develop the control policy of the two warehouse .
on the one side , Tru@@ mp , which wants to rise to growth and citizens , to increase the growth .
his critics keep him with him , so that the budget deficit would only be bigger .
on the other side , Clinton , who want to demand some taxes , and that it &apos;s more taxes , and their critics say , more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; each poultry woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee the alone account , almost as everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house has been refuge .
in a large kitchen , four women .
each has a baby , which is not one year old .
a little son in the arm laid down in the arm .
with great eyes curious in the room .
his mother star@@ red on the table top .
until it noted that they will be observed .
you are ch@@ ased and remove the little ones at the little ones .
the scene is normal .
until you speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is a unit manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aid offers in Bavaria , and is concerned with the subject of women on the flight .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the north of the north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs put together the establishment of a Pro Familia and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe institution in January .
she officially opened her .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there is no - also known as visitors .
the exception is a qu@@ mann before the door .
&quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say : every woman who has seen here , has done on her escape with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
because of wars , because they shall be persec@@ uted , because they threat@@ ening torture or death , or because their families will send them as a hopes for their families to Europe . &quot;
in women , there were other reasons for the escape : &quot; many places secre@@ tly secre@@ tly , because they do not see any other way . &quot;
in her homeland , they have made experience of sexual violence , forced , honorary moral , sla@@ very or forced constitution .
they continue to continue .
we continue to flee the further .
&quot; that tu@@ g for instance , for instance , a bottle of water is no rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and women are alone , they are not protected from their families .
who believe that the end when they arrived in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
here , all women in the refugee camps often were often considered as min@@ der@@ ous and worse ( even worse . )
this leads to that about 90 percent of women who live in the house in the Munich north , trau@@ mati@@ zed them , estimates them .
&quot; some of the children are safe to have been voluntarily . &quot;
many women are so long that they say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t feel to talk about the earth , because the sh@@ am is big . &quot;
since they didn &apos;t have to help millions , require it more accommodation only for them , calls B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district ruled for the accommodation of refugees .
at the question whether they have been using a similar project as in Munich in its stat@@ in@@ ability , reply some with N@@ ein .
Upper Fran@@ ks not exist in the Upper Palatinate and Ober@@ franken approximately there is something of self @-@ catering governments in the Upper Palatinate .
the women are not separated in Schw@@ aben alone , women are not separated from the government , &quot; Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press Officer of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower Saxony and Mittel@@ franken there are some common stories or their own houses just for the standing women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bayern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
also the Committee &quot; Rights of Women and equality of the sex@@ es &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women separated from men .
in a study that was published for the committee , it is : &quot; it is very important that men and women can be separated from men . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the privacy or are accommod@@ ated together , &quot; it can catch up or catch @-@ up violence against women . &quot;
especially the shower room should be separated and accessible for women in the study .
as very the women of this shelter can be felt , you can get the And@@ rang that there is at the house in Munich .
since there has been about around that , we have a long waiting lists , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
it might be slightly to make a second house .
assistance : demand for new working amp@@ utation measures : demand for new working amp@@ utation
the deputy representative of the assistance in their union have called to be called for new workers with their stri@@ es to be approved by a new agreement .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded its entire Council to permit more working performances from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that there were ministers that there were ministers to enter the concerns regarding the agreement .
assistant to assistance and medical students have agreed on a mutual agreement with the BM@@ A by the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members , who have agreed with the elections .
in a letter to the members , which was released on Thursday evening on Twitter , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had been under@@ gone a quiet sound &quot; to problems what the treaty was rejected .
she said , &quot; in view of the J@@ DC board , the proposed new contract has to complete the proposed new contract with the proposed new negotiations on all occasions . &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC board has made a formal application for a special application for the BM@@ A Council to promote a running program of labour law , which begins at the beginning of September .
the strike led to that assistance of this year six times , the first total events in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A assistant to Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana joined the mutual agreement to the agreed contract of the contract , which were recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members in the meetings , which still took in front of the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistance and medical students , that the contract should be beneficial to the contract .
after the vote of the Minister , Jer@@ emy H@@ unt said that the contract for doctors in England could be introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a Gest@@ e that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday , to give hands the hands and an official end of the eight months in the words of the words of the words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin made his Turkish counterpart in the gold @-@ gil@@ ded room of the St. Petersburg Palace in Reception , I cannot give me it to a counter@@ pressure , Ankara , in most reconciliation .
there was the hand stop , yes .
but put@@ ins also took nar@@ row@@ ly , nar@@ row@@ ly , and be@@ aded not heat , even for his return ratios .
Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an , on the other hand , said repeatedly from his &quot; love friend &quot; Putin - according to a report , five times .
I couldn &apos;t count it . I couldn &apos;t count it .
he said , he said that relations to Russia could not only return to Russia before the crisis , but even even further .
on the next day a newspaper announced that the Erd@@ og@@ an had heard that , as would never have happened .
at the end of enthusiasm , his enthusiasm rather seemed to indicate the opposite .
but a Putin of Putin under the chief of Russia showed that the State of Russia had not forgotten .
on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in His words : the amor@@ tis@@ ation of a Russian Kamp@@ u@@ lu@@ k from the Syrian border through Turkey .
in response to the time , Moscow was w@@ ut@@ ly .
Putin took up and acc@@ using Ankara , Russia in the back .
it was even bigger , as it was said to have been committed by an official friend .
the Vet@@ os@@ rough will be difficult to build even if it is not impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has been converted to Russia since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once , it seemed that the Turks bear the debt for all the gu@@ ilt .
the serious worsen@@ ing was serious by the official government officials that Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s own family of illegal oil trade in Syria would have been adopted by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he was cont@@ ested this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St. Petersburg , the official message that it was time to look back to the front .
finally this meeting was only instead of instead because Putin received the President of the president , he wanted to hear .
in Russia , Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a tru@@ ce is clear on the hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an is on the first line of all friends that he can get , after it became a coup d &apos;@@ etat of his Am@@ tes at a failed coup d &apos;@@ etat of his Am@@ p .
the terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there is also economic motifs .
Russian sanctions imposed Turkey some time - especially the ban of charter flights , which every year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
the number is declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and char@@ ter@@ companies will be facilit@@ ated , when the flights will be taken again .
you belong to the Mediterranean Sea with the Mediterranean Sea .
this week , the country TV is inexpensive fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural could be imported again .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti was formulated by the following words : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is focused on the West , since it was response to the conflict as a weak response .
for this purpose , the persist@@ ence of the EU acc@@ entu@@ ates the EU acc@@ eding negotiations and Putin - the disc@@ los@@ ure of the EU acc@@ eding to reduce the trend and to reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West .
the Russian State leader in Ankara with security had a bonus that he demanded a coup d &quot; é@@ tat for the chosen state of State .
this is well @-@ evident for Moscow , which has a self @-@ evident case , which even has a deepest fear of inf@@ rin@@ gement .
the summit in this splendid palace in the sea allowed Russia and Turkey , one like it described me an analy@@ st : &quot; the alliance of outside cant@@ ons , &quot; : two countries , which treats from the west and bad@@ ly joined by the west .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still major differences between the two even large differences .
the largest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ eke@@ eping , but where Russia and Turkey have already support more .
it may be that , after almost three hours , both President would have agreed upon the press conference on the press conference that they had not even under@@ ed the subject .
the President of Turkey said to reply to a question about their differential to reply , while Putin decided to emphasize this one .
there is no clear con@@ sen@@ sus that may be found in front of a joint N@@ en@@ ner in Syria .
but after months of fine pr@@ un@@ ing - and in view of the potential for a perfect Dis@@ aster , as the NATO member of Turkey became the Russian fighting jet - it certainly better to talk the two Heads of State at least one another .
Royal Bank of Scotland cannot be available at the Royal Bank of Scotland outside Scotland .
according to the Board of Chairman of the Bank , R@@ BS is to be reduced to a back@@ rest role at the Board of Staff of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ EW@@ AN divided the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand were linked to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the Bank has since been di@@ pped since then , when they had been ab@@ sent and saved prior to eight years ago .
in this time , brand name &quot; R@@ BS &quot; has been used to protect other final @-@ end brands .
she supported the international sport with million pounds to sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to move more national brands in the focus of the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized yet .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the central headquarters and the stock market will change to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank has already been used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for private customer business , which will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
during a variety of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire , Mc@@ EW@@ AN was inter@@ viewed during a variety of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
he joined the BBC Scotland , with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will be at our investor brand , as well as to the brand that our employees will be employed , since we will now be more to a bank of brands . &quot;
when the Bank was added to a global brand , R@@ BS has been to the global mark .
I say that we have no global targets , but local targets .
each of these brands will be completely totally totally different and our employees are working among these brands with the customer .
R@@ BS has already announced that it will not continue to continue his Six sponsor@@ ship sponsor@@ ing of sponsor@@ ing of the various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ing will increase .
it &apos;s time for us to develop the Bank &apos;s brands , for example , we focus on the inside ( we have required ) to make this to a better Bank for customers ? &quot; said the Executive Board .
it would have been very z@@ yn@@ ically in three years ago when we said that we have launched a great bank for our customers , and launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , think I will see many changes .
we can re@@ launched these brands again , therefore I think that time is come .

Russia , Russian Putin and Chief of Defence Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed an unexpected by his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years of the eng@@ est confidence in Putin of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed special responsibility for Environmental and Transport Industry .
in an opinion from the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s opinion it is that Putin is said to have ordered this duties as chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been the deputy chairman since 2012 was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in Tallinn in 1972 , he made his conclusion at the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin means ( in Russian ) , it is that he later was chief of protocol and chief of the control technology .
over his appointment , he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think that it is the most important task of the government to assist your activity as head of state @-@ out and controls on the implementation of your instructions .
Putin performed the Russian TV channel on Friday with Ivan@@ ov to leave his position and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
see the s@@ mil@@ ing faces ?
this step is made in Moscow .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was long time of one of the closest confi@@ denti@@ sts , Vladimir Putin and works as he worked for Soviet Intelligence , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
on a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , the two men had claimed his request at his own request .
but despite the round of the cameras , only few of them were convinced - especially before the parliamentary elections .
here is the result of a kind of power up@@ take ?
the white no one has no one .
but the official alleg@@ ation - that a man who once constituted them as a potential president to conduct the Russian environmental policy - came to a large sc@@ ep@@ ticism once again .
in his remarks on Putin , that is quoted on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin said that Ivan@@ ov said it is true that I could say this very complicated - one could almost say - this could be reached for four years .
as it out , I am out for four years and eight months of Chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential administration .
Ivan@@ ov took part in the post of December 2011 .
he previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian security Council and such as Putin &apos;s former member of the state security service .
in the late 1990s , as Putin Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , was appointed to the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin made his power in Ivan@@ ov , Ivan@@ ov called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , of whom he was confi@@ dential .
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could happen to the second term President of Russia , as a third term of coup could bear against the Constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close to the allies , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister , before returning to the President in three and a half years later .

we are all witnesses of a engineering of engineering , from a ver@@ itable dimensions in this project , with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closing is between Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge @-@ deck , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
a total of almost 79 % of the whole bridge at its place and the last section of the de@@ cks will be given at Ros@@ y@@ th today in Ros@@ y@@ th today , which means that the whole deck is ready to be at the bridge to his place .
Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tor said : &quot; the first loading was a significant milestone in every bridge project .
this fantastic project presents the forward @-@ looking forward and civil engineering at this fantastic project .
after the installation of the last street views and its connection with the expansion of the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the gap on the North or land@@ side in the expansion .
this was reached via Zi@@ onist of the Northern Zu@@ er@@ bridge 700 millimeter south of the south .
this was a massive and very hei@@ g@@ le activity at the same time .
massi@@ f , because the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , approx . 6.000 tonnes and an inclin@@ ation of approximately 3 % had to be moved upwards .
Hei@@ kel , as the toler@@ ances , which works the team , is tiny - on each side , they just add some millimeters .
fortunately , everything was very good .
salvation in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have still alive &quot; lucky in life . &quot;
three men have still alive &quot; lucky , &quot; after she was thrown away from the fishing boat at Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI life@@ station is proposed on Friday 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm , after a crew had observed the incident in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in security , while their boat went into force during its own power .
we saw the boat in its proximity to itself and ordered the closure before , &quot; said the director of the life@@ station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones .
fortunately , the strong winds of the boat already have a boat apart from their range , until we decide to water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were saved from a local fishing boat , while the third man was suspended at the age of 60 , and in a bo@@ je , without the life@@ jacket were found .
they came all on board of the coast boots and were back to the rescue station

difficult to injured - husband on his Ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife , attacked and difficult .
like the police yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had to get the keys to the apartment to pick up his personal things .
on the cut , the alcoholic perpet@@ rat@@ ors instead of his Ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend instead .
when this came home to the apartment , st@@ ach twice on them .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and injured .
police could take the perpet@@ rat@@ ors in the perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old the clothing of his Ex friend , he called his mother .
this al@@ ar@@ led his sister .
together with her life , the 45 year old , he wanted to present their brother to her brother .
it was able to move him but not to move the apartment .
they went with her living conditions from the house .
on the street they met the ex @-@ life @-@ endanger@@ ed man of the man .
when the two women lay out the apartment once again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old is his sister to side and made his Ex @-@ friend .
you want to improve the good apartments ?
the SPD and Grü@@ ne my : investors have to be raised much stronger in the future .
as respon@@ ds to the bad message , Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 favorable apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD proposes to the next round out meeting a &quot; action concept . &quot;
but the fight .
on the first line it goes to the question : who is to build a favourable price for a favourable price ?
a regulation is missing .
Christoph vi@@ mann writes : &quot; we have said , &quot; We are able to build the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build up to urban areas , there must be 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing . &quot;
however , the affordable apartments are also created in the stock .
but the big point of the town hall was , however , as viol@@ mann : &quot; how goes to investors to build a private space on private areas ? &quot;
we want to make investors on such areas at least 10 percent , but as possible to build 20 percent of the apartments as a social housing . &quot;
a new urban housing programme , which will cost CHF millions , will be financed and will be financed at An@@ rei@@ ze .
the problem , as viol@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the frac@@ tions . &quot;
however , CDU wants to make investors as a few rules .
the Lin@@ ke is still subject to investors .
regardless of the situation , bro@@ mann , b@@ ah@@ ne is an disappearance of the situation on the housing market .
if the concept is implemented , the concept will provide additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is unc@@ le@@ ar whether we will get the expert forces .
yet , the program does not include : because the around 12@@ 60 new apartments should be built .
like this , however , the loss of some 1300 inexpensive apartments come from , whose promotion will run in the next few years ?
by 2020 there will be 500 apartments by 2020 .
to prevent this , the plan@@ ation of the Nicole Palm , the plan@@ ation of the city will now be bought out of the city .
in addition , the apartments should also be thought to pick up the apartments again in the price connection .
this is possible in the West@@ stadt town .
the problem , solve the problem .
because in the West city , as at the end of the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be returned to the price connection for favorable apartments .
only : that &apos;s the owners , the housing companies not only .
for example , the number of social rooms in the West@@ stadt again increase dras@@ tically , removed from the target of the so @-@ called mixture .
a concentration of social weak in just a few city gates should not give it more .
the Green Green proposed that there will be a movement in the discussion .
spokes@@ person Holger Her@@ lit@@ schke said : &quot; for a broad majority , the CDU board must have to do with the boat . &quot;
in fact , there are concentrated on more construction sites for family homes .
however , what does not name that not yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , which is worth worth@@ while .
it &apos;s fascinating to tell how the world changed .
in the past decade , teen@@ ager and child needs to go out again , but it was rather good to spend their free time to spend their leisure time , on screens up to rigid , was accused of having participated in the last decade of many .
with Pok@@ emon Go it &apos;s therefore to get people from the sofa and let it become active .
the time on the screen was initially restricted to the TV , then on video games and most recently to smartphones .
therefore it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities are not close to each other .
I &apos;m out of course , of course , on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn that were based on the characteristics , which were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later , an animated series , game maps and other spin @-@ off ) were created .
as many phenomena of Pop@@ ular culture sank out , before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within less days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is more user than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short time the players left with their smart phones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mons , who have been pursued with a GPS and once they were found once they were photographed . &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot of the mobile phone ) or caught up . &quot;
a generation that played the game , when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and finished in the search of the sofa .
in the USA led the game to a considerable increase in steps which puts the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Car@@ di@@ ally , an app for Apple Watch , who recently purchased Washington Post in Washington , agreed that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of re@@ conc@@ ise people who wish to train every day 30 minutes to 53 per cent of the game .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only looks the raw data for performance .
many public relations campaigns to health , the people want to take away &quot; 30 minutes of time , &quot; by the sofa , &quot; and &quot; every day is actively involved in the ears , because many public messages are coming to health bor@@ ing and come from people who come to people . &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of Sport cannot be assessed .
those who regularly contain sport drives , reduce his chances , to cancer , or depression .
physical control helps with the weights control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages which may lead to it here .
but the wonderful on Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do anything in the open that they make fun .
therefore three columns of the health cover - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun .
some people join the hunt for new friendship .
as always , there are also m@@ ür@@ al play@@ er@@ ber , which have to be connected to something like a bit .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should ? s ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit already tested our activity , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game .
the new era will lose his maturity and the use will be covered with the time .
however , due to poker success , it will be more games to unite the apps and virtual reality with the active world will be combined in the real world and will help many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and swe@@ ep .

this success she introduces them in the same division as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps to al@@ locate its sports at new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years , with such amazing exercises , including 10 gold medals , with such amazing exercises that the Olympi@@ asi@@ bility of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Gr@@ on said that she is &quot; the best winner , &quot; which I ever seen . &quot;
it expected to be a final examination in Brazil , a competition , which was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athlete , but rather , between her and a load @-@ dimensional expectations .
not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered a dis@@ appointment .

police : 3 victims in series production during the music listen to the music .
according to police reports that were killed on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first series of Phoenix , while they heard in the car and heard of music .
Angela Merkel liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah was shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked to the authorities .
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of mo@@ ist eight shots from a w@@ ak@@ w@@ ning weapon , while he was on the front side of the car and then fled to a other vehicle , is found in the report .
the police arrested , that the three times of murder did not have the outcome of a rob@@ f@@ anci@@ ed murder , as the attack@@ er does not have the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were in possession of an adult victims .
the Poli@@ ze@@ pre@@ aching of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of the investigation was led to an immediate view , whether it is connected with four previous attacks .
in total , primarily were killed in h@@ is@@ pan@@ an area , within four months of nine attacks , seven people killed and two further injured .
this happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; Howard K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , the beginning of the month .
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects has several vehicles used , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s , and a white Cadi@@ llac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators said to continue the evidence , that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and of the same mort@@ ars were committed .
El@@ lis , 33 , was true due to their violations , and passed away in later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still in site .
a witness divided the police with that it was not unusual to listen to music in a par@@ able car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the sli@@ des@@ how to empty for a empty pickup truck that was prec@@ eded by half an hour before the three days of murder , that it was prec@@ eded by the work of the serial mort@@ ars .
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and transparent ball from the seat as well as ball frag@@ ment@@ ée from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to , loves the S@@ ingen , toys and of course his mother .
but in the fe@@ west of his ageing , Edmund micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ted , the result of a genetic error , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to , during their pregnancy .
when he came home after his first time , my first thought I was not yet .
I made this not .
I did not have to be left .
what is not true - naturally , of course , she has settled upon it , &quot; said it . &quot;
her husband Vincent and her , Vincent and her became aware that Edmund it will never be able to survive under circumstances .
some doctors went so far so that they pit@@ ched him to institutional him .
&quot; my first answer was given to &apos; I knew that people still do &apos; , &apos; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with the help of a secret aid .
Edmund could neither sit down to his third year , neither was still alive , and he still not speak .
but he makes slowly progress .
he can run with support and cycle cycling .
he loves to sing , with his two brothers , and to sing .
Elizabeth is the drawing language , which Edmund for &quot; please send me something before . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him drawing language at &quot; , told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it &apos;s no typical string language -- she says . Edmund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ scopy hal@@ o has a variety of causes : genetic such as Edmund and infections with viruses , such as mas@@ onry or the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary slightly .
it &apos;s still to say , how to influence the life of the tick with the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to is reminiscent of the emotional prize of an un@@ certain future .
I asked about what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they don &apos;t know it really .
I have not been asked for a long time since a long time , because I don &apos;t know that they can really say to someone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ el@@ sen@@ ator for mothers of acid with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus .
it is better to better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and you will love your child .

why we &apos;re Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie .
that &apos;s what I am under the women &apos;s member in the tower , and that is composed of more than one reason .
first , I am since 1984 at any summer Olympi@@ ad and the USA were never so dominant .
and secondly , this team has three Tur@@ ner@@ ed , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie &apos;s &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who had the many young girls of other skin art .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the J@@ ew is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ cian , round off every proud .
this team reflects the USA against the USA .
it has the black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic female presence at the fore@@ front of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one was one of the female tur@@ f an Af@@ ro @-@ Americans .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
in the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ ad and the Americas .
now , the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as it unexpected , but most of the best @-@ lasting G@@ ym@@ as@@ tik@@ rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone the fourth , h@@ eter@@ isation of American , who won a race event for women Gold in an individual multi @-@ events event .
clubteam member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the tip of this kind , but you can see turn@@ around in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie came to create all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympi@@ am@@ end is only four Tur@@ ner@@ ed in the team . moreover , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a train@@ ers .
but the reality is so that Tur@@ ns will be more expensive sport and Turner to the first line to combine their parents , competition , travel gar@@ ment , competition , and hotel costs ( for the coach and their Turner and families ) . the list can be removed from any time .
the majority of these Gym is in a we@@ al@@ thy subur@@ bs that support the business .
in this course , Turner you get a complete training and that is a lot of life and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
Aim@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both her athlete , since they started with the Tur@@ ns .
we have to be inspired by the communities of many , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , have been inspired by a fully equipped and easier access .
I founded my gy@@ ro @-@ Foundation for 20 years .
at my events we have free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ es ) , and international and international competitions .
in September we will expanding Detroit ( my home town ) to Detroit ( my home town ) to provide the youth high @-@ quality tower to learn the chance to learn from this great Olympic sports art .
tower developed strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and destination for the spirit .
this combination offers life @-@ long advantages for health and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the tower and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in the Sports , especially for girls .
this is an interesting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of Olympic champion , and thank you so many young girls can be motivated to start their way to start sound , strong and successful young women .

the former minister for the integration and municipal Government , who now have a cor@@ rupt cut from religious mo@@ tives of religious mo@@ tives , would be to be the police to create , shut down out of elect@@ oral mal@@ ines , in order to protect the vot@@ ers .
he recommends that vot@@ ers should have a reference to prove their identity in order to prove their identity .
at the moment , a vot@@ ers must only call his name and address .
the report proposes that no removable ink on the finger of a person if they give their elect@@ oral damage to prevent them twice a cho@@ oses .
W@@ hist@@ an even more protection should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for that time , the Press should have access to the municipal documents and decisions of not official Com@@ mittees , or work groups .
&quot; this is not only against the elect@@ oral , but also the municipal government before the wider cor@@ rupt and financial pen@@ sion@@ ism , which will protect against &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by the Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets elect@@ oral and@@ als in the east of London .
in the last year , a Special Court decided that the President of the Lut@@ for Rah@@ man had to be cor@@ rupt after a Lit@@ any of cor@@ rupt and illegal practices of its am@@ tes above .

he expressed especially al@@ ar@@ mier@@ z for frau@@ dul@@ ent letters - at the older members of the Muslim community , in people who had to choose the candidates of their choice .
Sir Eric , shown several recommendations to carry out the elect@@ oral system , including the scripts to prove the identity .
in his report it says : &quot; as proof that pressure in need of some ethnic min@@ orities were killed , particularly women and young people , in order to choose according to the Will@@ ens of the elderly , in particular communities with pak@@ ist@@ an@@ dic or ban@@ anas in the background .
&quot; there was concerns the fact that ... State institutions such as such behaviour would have been ignored , because of &quot; politically correct , &quot; regarding the Eth@@ nie and Religion or religion . &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations in order to clean the system , including the ban on political activists , policy documents to stop &quot; elect@@ oral &quot; campaign . &quot;

a British travel under@@ going his immune system and saus@@ age of a serious test - by creating some of the tast@@ es and ec@@ ti@@ est places of Europe .
the pres@@ enter and travel agency Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k , on a Euro @-@ shot , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a dish@@ wah@@ er of a tensile toil@@ ette and a public telephone in Russia to provide the resistance of his immune system .
before the abl@@ ings of any object , it used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show and show us what it will be .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results in daylight .
the idea , the dish@@ wah@@ er of a tensile toil@@ ette which was already used by thousands of other , may be completely ab@@ rupt , but in fact , there are more bad bacteria .
in his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright with doctors and medical specialists spoke about the promotion of Dar@@ mb@@ ately , as well as his own health .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , nothing left what he raised , more than a bad dis@@ gra@@ bs in the mouth .
Mr. Wright became known for this , the resistance of his Dar@@ ms , traveled by the world , and ate @-@ like , as well as wonderful things .
from public money back to washing stations up to dish@@ cris@@ p of toilets , the task showed his immune system definitely below one sample
in the movie he told : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned , what my health affects my health , and I have my possible things to my mouth , earth , saus@@ age and s@@ mil@@ king . &quot;
in the film he was able to meet his call for each case .
the tiny public toilet in Russia was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his pro@@ be@@ zel revealed a L@@ umin@@ ometric number of over 4000 units .
in comparison , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ er@@ isation amounts to fresh hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to break after their L@@ umin@@ ometric number over 4000 units , while fresh@@ ly absorbed hands one from less than 60 .
Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products produced the Reis@@ ef@@ il@@ m &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; who shows the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ ahl at various locations such as the bathroom .
in the film , he says : &quot; this comes to the worst what I have in a toilet , close to &quot;
there is nothing dirt road than that !
I &apos;ll have nothing to hide here because there is dr@@ unk here .
the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products vali@@ o .
the company st@@ ains Mr. Wright with vali@@ dation gradient from both lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus and vitamin C and D , in order to support the promotion of Dar@@ mb@@ h and the immune system .

we led a crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings , so that we said , &quot; we said to call &quot; L@@ ass . &quot;
she claim that the interest in intestinal health is to become a global phenomenon .
instead of only about the products we wanted to talk to a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our all@@ day environment , the importance of intestinal health and the immune system is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we could provide more information on an interesting way in consumers .
I think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film of the film , added : &quot; let me say that I would have lost my respect for Ian , when he got out of things , I have made it for him , as the ek@@ el@@ dest Russian toilet which will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things that easier was easier to bring Ian to bring them to them , and others , in which this was quite difficult .
I am glad that we have recorded some of these dirty scenes on film . &quot;
in a vali@@ dation survey carried out by the year 2015 , 84 percent of those ques@@ tioned lac@@ tic acid bacteria , especially with the well@@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally products which included lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus .

at the above @-@ level side of the municipal facility , Mü@@ ll and old toys were thrown out .
he added : &quot; it is a shame that there are no responsibility for her behaviour , and to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family , because a delay is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing .
this was a very difficult fall , as the behaviour was extremely high and their de@@ eds for their neigh@@ bor had to be experienced .
I &apos;m all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community , we have passed to us , and we have made it to have prepared for us .
I hope that this development will cause a few neighbours , saying that anti @-@ socialist behaviour will not be toler@@ ated .

a more rarely moment , in which the normally great @-@ track and self @-@ confident multi @-@ track causes something like concerns .
after having thrown in his own republi@@ can camp from the race , the doub@@ ts now grow on his success in the struggle for the White House .
&quot; we have enormous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tru@@ mp prior to evangel@@ ik@@ als Christians , which led to the support of important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
he &apos;s false reports on its candi@@ dat@@ ure , took over his well @-@ known media reports .
republi@@ can Hoch@@ bur@@ ns
Utah is a safe Bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
a survey conducted by Sur@@ ve@@ y@@ USA from June , Tru@@ mp and his competitors from Dem@@ ok@@ rates , Hillary Clinton , equ@@ ates .
other institutes are on the front , however , not with the distance , which are common for republi@@ can candidates in the state of the state .
as a result , Arizona and Georgia also apply .
in an interview of the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp answered the question as it was again possible for the previous year : &quot; just as I &apos;ve made it so far . &quot;
and remember : this will be either successfully , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he will make nothing more , than &quot; the truth to tell . &quot;

the IOC will introduce an disciplinary joint mission to the case .
Ken@@ yan athletes threatened according to the second D@@ oping affair in the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s Rio de Janeiro .
after a constant experiment with a D@@ oping control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a train@@ ers at home .
the International Olympic Committee reported in order to establish an disciplinary joint mission to investigate the case .
a ken@@ ian function@@ ary was informed that the former Sprinter and today Coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village reached a Ur@@ in @-@ Trial , under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ name of F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ge .

the World Federation IA@@ AF developed the IOC in order to make information about the case to strict investigations into their own investigations in an IA@@ AF spokes@@ person .
depending on the results of the study and the following measures of the IOC will enable the IA@@ AF an assessment , &quot; says it in a IA@@ AF statement .
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) is used to have the D@@ oping control station and signed himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ge , which was signed and signed , &quot; declared Ken@@ yan chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accred@@ itation of the athlete , who stood on the list for the training motion of the world @-@ anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .

he is to be informed against cash payments for his country via an@@ dic D@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he was arrested on his return at the airport of Nairobi on his return .
at the IOC in Kenya for a long period of time , Kenya has already been under special control .
during the announcement of the IOC , more than 2000 D@@ oping target controls the Rio @-@ Games became an unusual previously noted that especially athletes of Kenya and Russia came into force .
the world @-@ anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil , a anti @-@ D@@ oping law and a functional control system .
the law was approved just a few weeks before the Olympic start .
in the consequence , the WA@@ DA Kenya took place from the list of countries , their D@@ oping control form with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya applies as a large runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won in Beijing in the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
in a series of television report on the ARD , the ARD have always been easily accessible to Kenya D@@ oping @-@ funds and to give it a significant ment@@ ality of the sport .
IOC @-@ member Richard Po@@ und demanded a similar research investigation in Kenya as it had made it in the Russian athle@@ tics track .
it could be proven that in this kind of sports and systematically alle@@ vi@@ ous .
in Russia &apos;s athletes were excluded from the summer .

Turkey : a Kur@@ dish municipality is charged with mass graves
he who does not fit and Erd@@ og@@ an , is seated on pack@@ ag@@ ings of caff@@ eine , who is the end of the Gü@@ ell @-@ near dialogue and world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kur@@ dish municipality in Germany are charged with tens of thousands of protective suits that fled from Turkey to Germany .
medium term could even be &quot; some hundreds of thousands &quot; are thought of the Association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
because of the hard front of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish municipality is a mass graves in Germany .
I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of thousands of protection from Turkey in Germany , when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime re@@ mitting min@@ orities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the Supreme Leader of the Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the world . &quot;
because the government had moved to Kur@@ dish Hoch@@ bur@@ gen in the course of the months ago , 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey had to flee .
after the failed coup are still sec@@ ular and op@@ position@@ ist ethnic Turks , after the failed coup .
many are going to start in Europe when they will continue to be suppres@@ sed in Turkey .
it may not be that a state that even refugees had been produced in the own country of refugees , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
the Association of Defence accused the targeted Syrian settlement of Syrian Arab Arab in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
as a result , Erd@@ og@@ an increase the remaining Kur@@ ds to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Gre@@ eks , have already been sold out in the past one hundred years or ou@@ sted , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k who is also the CDU member .
the Association of Staff demanded that the Federal Government was positioned &quot; as sharp in Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and his followers . &quot;
also in Germany , there is a &quot; hex@@ en@@ hunt for Erd@@ og@@ an @-@ critic .
I feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ ell movement also f@@ ears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , above all Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ elle .
the fire test as an Gü@@ ell trailer was destroyed by teachers and other acade@@ mics for vocational training .
he who does not fit and Erd@@ og@@ an , is located on pack@@ ag@@ ings of caff@@ eine , and also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ ell @-@ near dialogue and education , the world . &quot;
as the newspaper under calling on numbers of the Federal Ministry , the Turks have already reported the biggest group of campa@@ ig@@ ning for asylum in Germany in front of the coup .
as of June 30 , this will be 11.@@ 386 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all known as as@@ yl@@ ated ( 3@@ 9.@@ 625 ) .
in this survey you will not find the war , poverty or lack of sexual abuse .
asylum is entitled to the Basic Law only politically , so from state site , individually followed .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; then , where there are we@@ ave &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summ@@ ers of North Rhine @-@ Westphalia and cannot enter the Land@@ tag in North Rhine @-@ Westphalia .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they understood .
2021 will not be held directly at the end of summer holidays , the heav@@ y@@ ance held already decided at the beginning of the year .
as far as it &apos;s not so far , it &apos;s not : summer holidays , heat and land@@ fill meetings - that is buried .
the locals who are convinced by the elections , are to be convinced of the holiday .
most of the tourists who are in the country are on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not hesitate to choose the country &apos;s land .
for this purpose , practical problems : in the holidays , hel@@ per , the posters , air ballo@@ ons , Fl@@ yer , and at the end of the vote , only co@@ ar@@ piece at the end .
until September 4 , 2016 , the elect@@ oral and final holidays , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern needs to rise again close to the people over the people .
the hot phase , if one can say it at all , just started .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , Leader of a SPD / CDU Coalition , must be fear to his position .
the SPD , the most powerful party since 1998 , is now clear behind the CDU band .
this will be exciting as strong new@@ comer Af@@ ro , and what remains at the end of Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ es remains .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old , and since 2008 , Chief of Defence , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive campaign con@@ forms of his large con@@ forms .
he travels on the land , spread Ros@@ en , and plac@@ em@@ ates a little with the people , as it &apos;s already his legendary predecessor , Harald Ring@@ storff .
otherwise , sail@@ er wants to get cold feet and returns ch@@ anc@@ ellor at the gu@@ en@@ oid of Af@@ D .
their refugee policy , you &quot; We are creating the ascent of rect@@ angle lists which will probably be able to cost the beautiful position .
the CDU with their peak candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has experienced , as it is , when you fight for the wrong time on the right place .
she has invited twice German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( German Chancellor Angela Merkel ; Merkel Bundestag ) is located in the northeast .
but the target group voted not , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as the Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
there was probably the majority of the other federal states , &quot; accused Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in NDR .
but it also failed to listen to the other edges of Germany , Angela Merkel .
otherwise the Nord@@ ost @-@ CDU was largely updated to the usual choice of events on market places and in front of shopping centers with umbre@@ llas and air ballo@@ ons .
so , Kok@@ ert , games are only a &quot; higher @-@ level role . &quot;
also the Union also noticed that her on the country has been br@@ ittle in the country that they must ex@@ ert a wire to the people again .
it goes like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the un@@ certain@@ ties of the country , hardly exist .
however , the Council of the CDU election was co@@ hesi@@ ve on his competitors , however , where people are to go , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ ness , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much in the game , Sell@@ ering has now led his SPD now to a particularly dedicated campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats recently with 22 percent behind partners CDU ( 25 ) and just barely before the Af@@ ro ( 19 ) .
in the election 2011 the SPD was clear with 35@@ ,@@ 6 percent before the CDU ( 22 ) .
the Green Party , small party with seven percent in the surveys to create the go into the Land@@ tag .
they make a modern tu@@ ous and place their elect@@ oral campaign up of them on the Internet .
&quot; online election campaign &quot; is the Chairman of Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green election appears on track @-@ looking after local ab@@ mb@@ les among vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the peak of kan@@ atin , cur@@ v@@ t just with a boat ride through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ a lakes and it is also beautiful .
her impression : &quot; elect@@ oral vacation in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment : guest sites suffer from Sper@@ ing
at the speed , with which the B 27 is refurbished , there is nothing to m@@ eck@@ ers .
for the developers of the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in the morning , and only around 20 o &apos;clock , are praise .
&quot; they have done everything pretty z@@ ack@@ y , &quot; he tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff by the Jet petrol station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no delay .
the building site was able to arrive at the beginning of the week until the end of October will be done everything until the end of October will be ready .
the conflict will also be praised to the work of the construction works , when it goes to the facility of heating .
since the building site on Monday to the south , the lock of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and thus the link to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has again been removed again , the transport system has been relaxed within the place .
the citizens can now run by O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the defl@@ ection by the place seems to go back .
there was some significant complaints , &quot; says that responsible for the market management of renov@@ ations and director Florian King .
the people of Bach@@ l@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ er@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many cup@@ boards sought refuge and rather their Nav@@ i &apos;s sign than the signs .
what led to the needs of trucks in the residential areas .
since the speed limit do not have been observed , the community has strengthened the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; there was significant over@@ l@@ ations , &quot; says King , who made himself a lot on location about the location .
there are two to three per minute at least two to three per minute .
the quick start @-@ up was on the road with 77 km @-@ km from the tempo .
since the building site has been moved to the building , but it has become quiet .
for business professionals at the B 27 , it is just a little bit so that customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg will now open the road again .
in the cards , business@@ men can not occur in the cards .
but the B 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment has led to them in revenues , and every one can ask you look ahead .
however , some more and some less affected .
those who do with the &quot; End@@ less &quot; less to do so for other companies , for whom the refurb@@ ishment has hardly ever created .
in addition , at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; most light decline , &quot; but also that of course , &quot; the running is missing . &quot;
at the most powerful , the Local along the road are the most powerful runs along the road .
J. Albert G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds significant words .
this is already exist@@ ance @-@ threat@@ ening .
not only did not only him , but all the restaurants were hit . &quot;
it was lacking the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we need to be happy about any Euro turnover .
the revenues tot@@ alled to &quot; far more than 50 per cent . &quot;
the street is thrown into operation for two years . &quot;
at his age , half of his employees have to be released .
if I would have had a company with 4000 employees , and half would have been released , the policy would be different .
instead , the President Jörg Schmidt developed an inqu@@ iry on request by G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER , whether it &apos;s a financial support , which gives you a financial contribution from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now , they must also apply the dis@@ advantages which result through the rehabilitation .
G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other coun@@ ties , where some generous was handled .
in all Kl@@ ages , G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER will be sure that its guest site will be continued .
finally , the family business has been settled since 17@@ 15 , refers to the long history of history .
that other stem passengers now can now be subject to more often than the complicated transport system , it can be understood .
if you cannot run , it is also very different .
that its parent cli@@ ent@@ ele has returned back to the end of the rehabilitation work , G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER has no doubt .
despite the crises of BSE and the bir@@ d@@ oll , G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on his customers for the biggest crisis that has experienced its guest in their long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , which is already brut@@ alized .
in the name of the terrorist control of laws on the laws of the terrorist control .
according to the recent lawyers , the Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick security package .
but what has a Dul@@ ce status with terror ?
and what says the coalition partner to all ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the reconciliation of reconciliation .
all of his proposals are to be &quot; politically f@@ eit , &quot; the Federal Minister , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security product .
you didn &apos;t hesitate to request .
other , more stringent points would be discussed at first within the parties .
I was also putting me on me .
as Interior Minister , the Minister of Interior was on the results and in a &quot; re@@ el@@ able con@@ sen@@ sus &quot; within the Coalition .
after recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is a little time when he presents his conclusions for the security in the Republic .
but these were the more extensive , but the more extensive .
a lot is already familiar , and announced that a new safety authority is to en@@ act a new safety authority to en@@ act the cra@@ ck system , is not new .
even the fact that Germany has to implement several EU specifications to include aviation data and arms .
the reputation after more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities do not be surprising .
for the part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second race for the suggestions that started up with the SPD : it wants to make sympath@@ ies for terrorist actions , and jihadists with double citiz@@ enship in the German Pass .
the difficult points are to be difficult for the SPD , &quot; The CDU Man of the CDU man . &quot;
it will be most likely to get to zum@@ ut@@ bar and encourage nothing that have not have a chances for the Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner .
a few new ideas presents to Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
these are partially partially in : it is planning rapid process for demoli@@ tion ations and more opportunities for the inc@@ iner@@ ation of people before the deportation .
refugees who are picked up into the country before their smart phones are supposed to leave their Smartphones and social media Ac@@ counts for a security check .
in &quot; Dul@@ ce for the past asylum seek@@ ers he wants to apply some worse than so far - such those who go to inter@@ sper@@ m or her papers to wear their identity .
some of them is politically and legally .
even un@@ balanced , even un@@ balanced , and you have any questions .
and with some points - in the im@@ line treatment of Ged@@ ul@@ ls , for example - is the question : what does not do with safety and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère it is important to differentiation between the topics of refugees and terror .
but it &apos;s not possible to make sure that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees were found .
in addition , many people made many people in view of the high refugee camps to improve security .
and things that deteri@@ or@@ ate the people , could not have cl@@ amps even in elect@@ oral season times .
the inner safety is enormous in the focus of focus .
only the attack in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
the Att@@ ach@@ in in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the un@@ certainty is great .
and yes , there are choice of events .
Union and SPD themselves bring to the subject of inner safety thus becoming increasingly in position .
in the past days , it went high between the two parties .
only a gar@@ ner@@ ed fight over the equipment of the Federal Police , then sent a safety @-@ critical ideas collection of some Uni@@ ons @-@ Interior Minister , in which he also challenge a Bur@@ ka @-@ ban and a return by the double citiz@@ enship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère recru@@ t also work to a con@@ cili@@ atory sounds here .
from a return from the double pass it is nothing .
we have agreed the discussion in Germany .
they &apos;re new to make it really meaning@@ ful .
he is constitutional law under a bur@@ ka @-@ ban of law .
whether his own package is un@@ fixed at all corners , and whether it was actually &quot; zum@@ ut@@ bar &quot; is still in the coalition partner , it must still show .
it is a lot about the fight for fight .
however , the SPD is trying to benef@@ itted on the subject of internal security .
Part@@ tion@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel signals only be careful talk to and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that in order to increase security further . &quot;
Volkswagen g@@ lim@@ it@@ less is still delivered by Volkswagen .
despite diesel sk@@ and@@ als , the supplier of the globally available worldwide .
but not in all markets , it will not work in all markets .
at the return reaction , there are also a term .
Volkswagen starts at the delivery deliveries in the second half of 2015 .
in fact , despite its many brands and some well @-@ run markets , the largest car manufacturer can show further an Plus in the previous year , despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
however , in July weaker the core mark is VW mainly in Western Europe and loaded up again the overall sale , such as the DAX is listed in the DAX .
globally sold the VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , following China &apos;s second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s previous year .
in the home market of Germany , the deliveries will be almost a sixth place in the home market of Germany .
marking , Chief Apostle Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July , mainly on two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , there have been given a purchase price in some core markets through &quot; modified economic conditions . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup in Turkey also charged the British vote for the withdrawal from the EU , explained a Spre@@ cher@@ ries .
in the US where the exhaust gas aff@@ inity were first @-@ calibr@@ ated , there is also a Min@@ us be@@ ech .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
in total , mainly affected sides of the Lower Saxony continues through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extradition increase of minus EUR 0.9 per cent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
from January to July the Group CEO Fred Kap@@ pler was able to show a sale at the sale of January to July .
Volkswagen in this time is supplied by Volkswagen in this time , worldwide : 5,@@ 904 million .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated by a software program manipul@@ ated by the software .
in Germany alone , VW takes about 2.5 million cars to re@@ arm@@ ament into workshops .
in the course of re@@ arm@@ ament , VW announced that the conversion of cars had no negative impact .
after upgrading the vehicles return it in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor capacity no worsen@@ ing .
the car point for the customer after upgrading a &quot; guaranteed &quot; guarantee , &quot; but not by a &quot; guarantee , &quot; how it was on Friday in corporate travel .
the reason to be legal powers .
the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen granted his German customers now a guarantee for free diesel models .
this had confirmed the last Monday VW @-@ representatives in the Federal Ministry of Defense .
from the Ministry of Education , it was confirmed that this meeting was held .
&quot; VW has fulfil the editions of my investigation commission and the KBA project . &quot;
according to &quot; deviations of it is not accepted , &quot; Federal Minister of Finance Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , according to the Ministry .
VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor capacity after upgrading no deteri@@ or@@ ations , and all typical approved vehicle values are unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee , &quot; but not to travel as it in company travel .
the wide term &quot; guarantee , Volkswagen has the possibility that customers for example a half year after upgrading approximately with a motor damage in a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do .
even in the customer &apos;s interest , it is important to avoid any other damage that do not have nothing to do with the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ k@@ sc@@ andal that comes to an un@@ certainty of possible guarantee claims as it was called .
therefore , VW is not the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see requires a range of spar@@ ers to the future of criminal cases - as a second institute in Germany .
as of Thursday , &quot; Bank@@ ers Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; it &apos;s just 139 customers to sell 40 million euros to Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily &apos;s items . &quot;
the Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single fall , and it does not have any signal : normal conditions would need to fear &quot; non @-@ fear for their savings . &quot;
save money in night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay 0.4 percent penalty .
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private - and corporate customers for deposits over 100.000 euros to gig or daily usage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100.000 costs $ 400 in the year &quot; said Paul .
he be@@ ware for ger@@ au@@ mer more than 40 million euros , which could be removed from one day to the other , and which he could not exceed .
there are 0.4 percent of the Bank &apos;s central banks , accounting for a cost of 0.4 percent . &quot;
&quot; I cannot wait for each million 4000 euros . &quot;
the costs of the order to be added after the surgery of the principle .
in the Tres@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank , the cash will be too high in the Tres@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank , it would have been too dangerous : &quot; I met four over@@ laps , I do not have the fifth ! , &quot; said the Executive Board .
most customers could have understanding and change on other investment forms .
only few migr@@ ated to other banks .
the Federal Co@@ operatives of Bavaria explained : &quot; the extreme @-@ term political course of the ECB caused considerable costs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it alone have not been able to bear &quot; business @-@ economically permanently . &quot;
some German banks have thus increased its fees for control guidance , credit cards or transfers .
with criminal liability for deposits from three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines in 2014 with their sk@@ at@@ bank branch office in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , main managing director of the banking association , said : &quot; we expect not to pay that private customers have to pay a busy audience for deposits , this is the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks much too strong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , &quot; The T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see give it &quot; a cli@@ ent@@ el that is equipped with wealth and lush . &quot;
&quot; that can be problem for a small bank for problem , &quot; if they are free of money .

the competition was hard , and threat@@ ens the descent of peace to the competition .

Dest@@ ination records records : who bought it !
the men of middle ages love with boards .
before you take part in the comm@@ anding position in order to over@@ hang him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym &quot; non @-@ Alle@@ in@@ sam@@ en@@ ames , which led to a result of current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the most promising Rem@@ aking of sound plates have not want to gre@@ et to a boom in Millennium than that are due to new understanding of physical objects , but on Mid@@ life @-@ N@@ ost@@ algia .
those who have recently bought a record , all predic@@ tions are between 45 and 54 .
indeed , the age group 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer group .
it is also no hor@@ des through the plan@@ er@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older turn@@ outs keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV would I follow the camera , while in the midst of a busy road in Soh@@ o , I would stay in a busy road , my hands do not burn , my hands and something like : &quot; so let us take us an immediate view . &quot;
so let &apos;s leave a look at the same time .
even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os is slowly set up in its charm - Hotels , restaurants and offices as well as the building in which once independent seller were located - there are a handful of fantastic turn@@ tables .
I would probably ask the camera to switch to the camera for the next part , in which I am standing in close proximity to various men in such shops and tests , her age and vegetables through observation .
Stuart , Glasgow , 55 , whom I was up from Sister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men of middle ages ) , a wife , probably around the 20 ) , is one day because of a meeting in London and continues through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; already , &quot; he says . &quot;
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 sheets .
this sound plates , shown above ( he sent me the sn@@ ail by e @-@ mail , I am not sent home , followed by me ) , then shine the walls of its living room .
the reason why he has a such si@@ zable number of albums , and Sing@@ les , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy it in the location , which he sold it , as he sold and ple@@ ad again to buy , when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things that I buy now , are published in the late 60@@ ies , early 70@@ ies , which was released , when I was 11 or 12 . things , when I thought to buy something for me , &quot; he says . &quot;
it is true that those who want to sell records , would like to spend time , and add it alone : &quot; I smoke not and I don &apos;t have much too much .
this is my L@@ aster .
We@@ z , 25 , who works at Sister Ray , believes that many customers who meets at the You@@ Go@@ v @-@ profile .
however , he also noticed a new shaft to people , who have influenced by the Medi@@ pe , people who have heard over the com@@ eback , and let &apos;s see their ancient records .
from the discussions that I have led people in the rule as around 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers that once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their CDs , &quot; he says .
that would explain the boom to tags of the turn@@ tables on a certain age .
but what is with the alleged emotional importance ?
it takes just a few seconds into a shop like Ph@@ onica , to recognize that record shops offers a based community of equality .
according to We@@ z , some of the older customers include contact with the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans have been overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to withdraw the stability of familiar noise levels , from counter@@ parts , the happy Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ ings .
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the feeding of a lease or property of material owners as a kind of Tro@@ st , &quot; says We@@ z .
that is with me as collectors and I think it is so that it is with many people .
it is a simple way to employ mentally challenging .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; flute is a staff of one record @-@ stack .
a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of the people who have bought a record , they did not have one record .
the pol@@ l found out that 41 % have a turn@@ tables , which they never use , while 7 % of those who have a plate , no turn@@ tables have no turn@@ tables .
at this time the news report would probably look very wor@@ ried , while I go through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova com@@ b@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works with sounds of the Uni@@ verse ( data number : three men of middle ages ) , has a &quot; trop@@ hi@@ p@@ ect &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone came recently here , and said , &quot; I have no turn@@ tables , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead power top , so I can play it into the shelf . &quot;
this is not a great percentage , but it happens definitely .
more productive @-@ consuming , less musi@@ c@@ tig .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
these are younger people , not older who come only slowly .
F@@ opp , which has been dedicated to the sound board almost a whole floor , has a b@@ under@@ way , than I go .
there are couples about 70 , tourists , photos make photos , teenagers and women middle ages .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the pre @-@ standing business - Wild Be@@ yond is the newest syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ tet Pop instead of experimental jazz band from the speaker , it &apos;s good to see a diversity of diversity in the customers .
none of them looks good , but nail @-@ psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are heavily damaged , when you stand for someone at least 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs for some minutes in the business and considered the variation of the sale to sale plates .
it would have a more effective bum@@ per than a large @-@ buy .
you did not have much much , therefore , the Coll@@ ective bag is not a real option , says it .
it costs much .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or to other way , but the beauty of plates is &quot; ... they drives with a cooked S@@ eu@@ f@@ zer .
I don &apos;t know how I ought to declare it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a shop , from which it is said that a new generation of turn@@ tables have inspired to have inspired , &quot; Urban Out@@ der .
while I enter the An@@ ten @-@ Hot@@ p@@ ants to Mu@@ sters , which I hope to create a group of young teen@@ p@@ ests , before a father and his daughter , to buy a cros@@ ley turn@@ tables .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics that are essential for an average collection .
no one sees them to - maybe because they are only decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to get it .
it is pure &quot; Platten@@ kunst &quot; . &quot;
however , however , considering that any attraction for these objects will represent more money for the industry , and some customers could send in the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more send .
there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , the one that is most of luxury items such as sheets .
even if my research results showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v , they leave , at least in turn@@ tables at Soh@@ o , the great number of female coll@@ ec@@ ti@@ cians who exist in reality , turn@@ tables and online stores .
these people are believed to work hard at school or offices in offices or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with safety on land transactions of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by means , while the st@@ ren@@ ches of an un@@ enc@@ ir@@ ri@@ mon@@ tory , 30 years of the false modern@@ ist , who do not reach the shoulders of middle ages .

French Court refused via A@@ br@@ iss of shops in the jung@@ les of a refugee camp .
a French court has rejected the offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jung@@ les of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
during a trial this week , the authorities argu@@ ed that the state must be able to sell 72 temporary businesses in which individuals within the camp &apos;s goods , sell cigar@@ ettes or tea for 50 cents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or easy meals to a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that these spots should be disman@@ tled because they would be paid a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid , and that is a fire - and san@@ itation .
humanitarian groups shared the court with that the shops and restaurants are important , since the free meals made by the national association and other groups are not offered , not enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
in addition , they led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille , decided that there are no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who have the 72 temporary shops , but the concerns the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; absolutely re@@ fully @-@ free . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the food shops , cafes and restaurants can play a much bigger role when they live in extreme pre@@ valent conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of peaceful items will offer between refugees and volunteers .

the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
in Germany &apos;s sh@@ er the next generation speed is to adjust to the next generation speed : in various states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash units are tested , the Tem@@ pos@@ oting of which was particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example on accident prevention , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by police .
for example on highway construction sites or to gentle bridges with temporary ec@@ ode , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure the speed limit in order to ensure the speed limit .
a permanent mobile design may be too dangerous or complex .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is aut@@ ark : its rechargeable battery maintains five days , which can be encrypted using a modem .
in addition , all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously with laser met@@ ro@@ logy , at the same time .
variable speed limit for time as well as gateway to the time , driving strip and vehicle class also be monitored .
in the highly folded state , you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with trailer coupling .
thus , it is not easy to use , it is lowered in the measuring operations , so that the wheels will disappear in the bre@@ w@@ ed and the way even worse outside the way .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is to protect the Bl@@ itzer against V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 the Tra@@ iler has been tested and used by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states since 2015 and now also used .

Britain : silver in the 7 @-@ year Ru@@ g@@ by , after Fiji Master@@ class Gold features
the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ year @-@ old Ru@@ g@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening to a ab@@ rupt hand at the last hur@@ dle at the Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were handled with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in De@@ od@@ or@@ us stage .
Fiji divided a master class at the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , desc@@ ending , lines and ro@@ sive strength to win gold - their first Olympi@@ am@@ e@@ ers of every color .
the defeat was due to the very well bad dry weight of silver medal for the Great Britain - and they could be very proud to their efforts in this tournament that they came to New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the B@@ oks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could be withdrawn in the final .
but regardless of the Fiji , there are a 15 @-@ man team in best form .
it might be a Tro@@ st for GB , but it is likely not - that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will depend on a gold medal by his neck : fi@@ j@@ is chef trainer Ben Ryan , the former head of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult road behind it .
ago , she lost eight years ago , Ryan every play at the Adel@@ aide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this loop is we@@ do , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji began wonderful and left the attacks of G@@ BS from Sp@@ ass .
it felt like the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , when one would run in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the above , when the O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au took place in the corner .
with four minutes of the season , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ w@@ ai was still an attack of the right corner from the right corner .
after the ball , 12 @-@ 0 and GB has hardly done the ball .
a h@@ ull shot of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stops the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third gate , but it did not hold the Fiji only .
in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua is in the right corner for a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa has added a new name since the playlist and there were still more than one minute of the season ... in the first half of the season .
V@@ al@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ aching further f@@ ading of the GB teams and stor@@ med to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 until break .
it is so that Fiji was born to play 7 , while GB are still rising .
it is also possible .
GB resulted in fundamental changes to half @-@ time and finished the fi@@ ji@@ a gap - for all four minutes , which was good for the circumstances of the first half time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova , after a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji .
Dan Norton started an attempt to GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game has been running in favour of the South Os@@ se@@ ans , whose fans s@@ angen , fa@@ ders and danced to the tri@@ way .
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ er@@ approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame got the i @-@ Tü@@ der@@ ings with another try in recent seconds .
the Pfi@@ ff crow@@ ning , the fi@@ j@@ is um@@ ber@@ ed and GB ki@@ cked up and beaten in the lawn .
earlier in the days , Fiji Japan had defeated 20 @-@ 5 defeated and the United Kingdom in South Africa with a half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match percentage from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the b@@ oks in the first half of the front , but Dan Norton broke out the line with an impressive foot and achieved a gate among the post in the second half .
a brilliant T@@ ack@@ ling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ bit team , secured the winning and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning by fight with the cancer of the train@@ ers of the rowing victory .
there will be no em@@ bos@@ ses gold as with these games and what is what is hot .
from the first rowing up to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve which go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in its gol@@ den@@ em moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though it was only the task of the family , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the train@@ ers Robin Williams , was present at the two positions in a row without tax conc@@ ub@@ les in a consequence , the first women in the history of the British sport that made such a scale .
their Domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , its 3@@ 9.@@ ter was installed , which is also exemplary .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ os , that reflects the surface of the elegance with the elegance , which is reflected not the type of Triumph .
behind each Gold in the ruin , a Bat@@ a@@ illon is to carry out the difference and there was no other things that no one was no surprise than the coach , who would not survive this day in the day , when he was diagnosed with him cancer .
as he said , he is what ris@@ kan@@ t .
I had bl@@ ad@@ der the bl@@ ad@@ der cancer that can be operated and did they think .
if you don &apos;t do this , it is not to do so anywhere .
it would have been a pretty ch@@ lim@@ me situation .
it changed a little view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had fortun@@ ate good luck to start out the treatment in early 2014 , outside the season , which could be held on a minimum , if that is the right term .
I needed money , so I had to go to me even better .
it was an inc@@ entive .
I was in hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet on a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient .
so it begins .
the ruin itself is already a challenge , but this makes it even bigger .
in the middle of the victory of the victory went their first thoughts on Williams , who went up a ner@@ ven@@ ous morning so somewhat more than usual , he was trying to process his own fre@@ eroll .
St@@ anning , which was as a commander in the Royal Arti@@ stry regim@@ ent in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . this is perhaps somewhat extremely tough , but it means much . &quot;
it is repeated how much mine that means how much I and Hel@@ en , and also Robin worked .
it was three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin , we would have no one , therefore goes a massive Dan@@ ke . he is the best trainer of the world .
I would not have any better person for train@@ ers or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponent could not go up .
even in the last 500 meters , when teams from New Zealand and Denmark had to close the teams , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had much in reserve .
we were caught in the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; lead in a process , lead in the process . &quot;
it is really important to leave itself .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not pleased about to make a little bit .
we wanted to see a fire@@ works today , we wanted to achieve a good result , continue and win the race , which we did so .
the pair will take place for a year time before making decisions about the future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve brick .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
this would have been much pressure .
in London there was about six months to realize that I am a Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ erin .
it was all so new for me and I was so res@@ sed .
it took about four minutes .
this feels so much better , &quot; said it .
for 31 years , exemplary for clarity .
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ s group , &quot; R@@ up@@ pert G@@ öller , goes into retirement .
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian @-@ wide . &quot;
a small @-@ restriction drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for large water producers .
some time ago it was in the origin@@ ation on Bay@@ er@@ on in a contribution of the Bavarian radio .
a bit later , the water @-@ forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ sen@@ ator .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ s group sailed from the Bavarian group as a pre @-@ bil@@ ling . &quot;

for more towns and municipalities there are water suppliers .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Ton@@ meister@@ in Gertru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Rupert G@@ öller was set out in 1985 as a water@@ mark and was appointed managing director of Zw@@ eck@@ busch in 1988 .
his tasks are highly varied and maintenance work from water @-@ management and rep@@ lication work on office and organiz@@ ational activities , the household goods , calculation of charges and contributions to emergency relief , said the chairman .
the current events called her commissioning and inauguration of the new Fountain ( 1994 ) , Fund@@ amental Con@@ struc@@ tions in the New Fountain ( 1998 ) and the re@@ mun@@ eration of the United States ( 1999 ) , the creation of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the partial load of water lines .
there have been no longer time , and we &apos;ve always included new features , because water lives and drinking water is the most important food .
in her speech , she brought up Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has used a lot of heart blood for its water @-@ purpose association and has lived the water @-@ purpose association that would have been his own company .
a few weeks ago , he was a real intern@@ ship to the success of the V@@ eit@@ s group at nit@@ rate in front of the water @-@ forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia .
for this purpose , he received very much recognition and praise .
the Rupert G@@ öller s@@ ails put together water in Al@@ f@@ ons , who worked together with him 28 years with him .
he is the best water slide and it was a loyal Kn@@ appe .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as the highlights from his sight , he called the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the re@@ structure of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pipe at the high reservoir in Kirch@@ lau@@ ter on a 3rd January .
here you had to work in minus 17 degrees the whole night , so that the towns are supplied with water .
the supply of Neu@@ brunn we also have to hold the supply of new brunn , because you have filled the flo@@ ods by P@@ ett@@ stadt with sh@@ utter .
on Daniel St@@ ür@@ mer , the management of drinking water , was handed over to Daniel St@@ ür@@ mer who succeeds Rupert G@@ öller .

steel - light view for German steel industry
the ir@@ is exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in milli@@ ion height .
financial loads , which is the sector from the eco @-@ power supply , are from the table .
lead in the liberation from renewable energies in the area of renewable energy production in the German steel industry , Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) said the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; I really happy about that we could finally reach at negotiations for two years . &quot;
at first , the European Commission had first planned to ask the steel manufacturer , the gases from the high oven to produce electricity generation on the box .
the steel industry threatened according to the German industry association additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros a year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , which is now a landmark association with the EU Commission for discussions with un@@ mistak@@ able Mar@@ gre@@ the Vest@@ ager .
only if the generators to replace in the steel units will be replaced , all a EEG inverter of 20 percent .
but these may not be collected in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the EU Commission on the O@@ wn ro@@ mer@@ production .
this means that the status of the current provision would have been largely written .
particular significance was the successful sampling by Gabriel for the steel industry .
with regard to our campaign &apos; steel the future &apos; is the first step . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even during the reform of the emissions of the emissions are climate and employment targets , &quot; stated IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt .
the steel industry in Europe has been operating under over@@ capacity and a significant pri@@ cel@@ ist since the financial crisis of 2008 .
last year , the situation continues to be seen as the world &apos;s largest land@@ fill in China in view of the weaker domestic demand for the global market .
Chinese steel companies un@@ cover the Chinese steel companies .
during this spring year , the situation has a little relaxed .
on the one show , S@@ ear@@ ch@@ anc@@ el oil on import of import effect , for the other have the economic prospects in China .
it is unc@@ le@@ ar how long the price is re@@ covering .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ yss@@ en@@ ru@@ pp stayed at Thursday .
last year , prices had again stagn@@ ated .
the industry re@@ acts on the difficult situation with further cost data .
in the case of Th@@ yss@@ en@@ Krupp , Th@@ yss@@ en@@ Krupp wanted to complete the closing of individual works .
at the end of 2015 , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , the German Steel manufacturers remain careful with increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced a slight increase of 3.4 million tons and six percent less crude steel as compared to the previous year &apos;s previous year , like the economy of steel on Friday .
after a brief increase in May , the amount of the amount finally returned to the second month .
the production of two percent below the year @-@ earlier period is of the year .
in the coming months , the association is exp@@ ecting an enhanced order situation by an improved order situation .
community , Spirit , health : sing sen@@ iors
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has been accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was her in school choir , in Leh@@ ra@@ mt , she finished music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
we are moving to me - emotional and physical body . &quot;
after a sample , they feels balanced , joy@@ ful and alive , it says .
very next to their health and her mind something good .
for S@@ ingen is equal to several perspectives a great hobby of sen@@ iors , says Erhard Hack@@ ler from the German senior league .
most sen@@ iors in chor@@ us , and divide the joy to music , describes Hack@@ ler .
the regular consult@@ ations may be called social contacts and maintain them .
for often , social and family structures at the age , an chor@@ us is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in its choir : &quot; willing to discuss and organize on the other hand , and to learn one another form - a choir of the mer@@ s@@ one . &quot;
sing can sing in the positive sense , h@@ acker believes , Hack@@ ler .
for a deep and controlled respir@@ ation .
who knows his L@@ unge regularly calls for everyday life in everyday life not as fast as quickly .
even if it goes to get the sound of voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimistic hobby .
on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz stated by the Federal Ministry for sen@@ iors @-@ organisations .
in the older generations , the joint S@@ ingen had a lot of higher importance , it belonged to everyday life in the school as well as in the leisure time .
L@@ enz observed often that the S@@ ingen or Hör@@ en of songs with older people many memories , often associated with positive emotions of their youth .
by interpretation and especially mel@@ ody &apos;s failed people themselves de@@ men@@ dou@@ s@@ ous people in long @-@ leg@@ ged events .
in addition , the head will also requires a special performance at the head .
at the same time , they focus on their own voice and to focus on a specified rhythm and to match the other singers - that is a great co@@ gni@@ tive challenge .
just older people who live alone , are not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that you are marked by the S@@ ingen choir , Hack@@ ler believes .
an enthusiastic public is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em was also growing at the choir through the S@@ ingen choir .
itself , even to show : if I have a little bit for something , I &apos;ll be better and w@@ se over me - this experience strength@@ ens .
good reasons to start with the S@@ ingen , there is enough enough .
who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate to do not hesitate to have little talent .
one sings is not alone - at 50 sin@@ the people who lear@@ nt to go there , even if a sound does it ?
on the search for the appropriate offer , the sen@@ iors have different ways , &quot; Hack@@ ler says .
if any man is singing in a full @-@ ench@@ y@@ or , you can easily connect to your friend .
many cities offer plenty of views over the choirs of the surroundings .
who like to sing in a church choir , can directly turn right to the church or the church .
many senior officials will be found on the Internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet , may ask the family , friends or neighbours around the Internet .
he who want to sing to sing , should definitely be a choir , and h@@ ack@@ ers .
sing the soul is good and has something free - that applies to each age .
react react sensitive and tom@@ cat on terror of the young animals
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover , which effect the herds of K@@ atz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys has grown to adult animals .
at their surprise the male did not see cold - however , it kept the difference to the female in the difference between the female .
female cats can recognize the production of K@@ atz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys at the age of 2 .
they react to Lau@@ te by ten percent faster to Lau@@ te von K@@ itt@@ ens , which in large need , such as scientists have found out by the animal at the University of Hannover and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
K@@ ater react to the ruin of K@@ itt@@ ens - however , at the same time , however .
apparently , the acoustic differences between less and strongly re@@ reg@@ ained young for the male may be re@@ per@@ cep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; said the bi@@ ologi@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
she is the first director of the study which was published in this Friday in the &quot; BM@@ C evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; in this Friday .
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found that the duration and the pitch of the K@@ itt@@ ens @-@ Schre@@ ie differs from their help .
a total of nine adult tom@@ cat and eight kit@@ es were reported from the animal by the MH@@ H .
you have played a little bit of little ones , which were taken for three minutes from the whel@@ ping box and have separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
for the other they were confronted with write rates of more stronger k@@ itt@@ ens , which were also high in addition .
the researchers keep their results despite the low sample sample for signific@@ ative .
&quot; all the female , even those who had no own offspring , re@@ signed into the Schre@@ ie , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they rot@@ ated faster to speakers when this ruin played very well @-@ reg@@ ression .
this ability may be born or evolution along with the sexually mature .
a surprise that the male did not re@@ acts at all , &quot; said the bi@@ ologi@@ in .
even in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on bab@@ y@@ no@@ ises .
also , some studies showed that women are sensitive to pur@@ g@@ ons , quite equal if they were mothers or not , reported a bi@@ ologi@@ ans in Marina Sche@@ ers .

just one year ago , Bangkok , in Bangkok , with an attack on a popular Hin@@ du @-@ swal@@ lows of 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody bombing of the country &apos;s younger history .
the right &quot; Iden@@ tit@@ ular movement &quot; is on the visions of the Federal Constitutional Treaty .
after several towns , the Constitutional Court also made the Constitutional Court under observation .
we will see the &apos; Iden@@ tit@@ ary movement &quot; An@@ no@@ points for efforts against freedom of democratic constitution , &quot; said the director Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German press agency in Berlin .
thus , Zu@@ wanderer forms , or from the Middle East in exceptional manner , diff@@ use .
therefore we can now watch the movement now .
the &quot; Iden@@ tit@@ ular movement &quot; is a group of French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
they sp@@ ends against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; an un@@ controlled mass tra@@ ce@@ dures &quot; and &quot; loss of your own identity . &quot;
Constitutional Court in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Saxony , Saxony , and Thuringia - observe the &quot; Iden@@ tit@@ ary &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said his authority has been closely matched together with the governments .
&quot; groups like the &apos; Iden@@ tit@@ ular movement &quot; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court .
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with adol@@ esc@@ ter language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the daily cu@@ mi@@ sts as well as right @-@ sex@@ es .
this is not a bed advertising for their own thing .
the propaganda should be emotional .
young people are due in special way .
this is dangerous .
most recently , from several federal states reports about contacts of the &quot; Iden@@ tit@@ ary &quot; was given to Af@@ ro @-@ political leaders .
Ma@@ ate said , I don &apos;t have any insights .
it may be relevant to the constitutional protection , possible contacts this species only be relevant from a certain point .
it is aware of whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - characterized by certain persons , which is exceptional , its target device changes and an extreme efficiency .
this is the decisive factor if such people have a influence on the party .
this is not visible .
with a view to the clear increase of rights motivated by dis@@ appoint@@ ments and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees , Ma@@ ate , he would not talk about new rights terrorism .
but we have found it in recent years that there may be a jus@@ tification of the structures .
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may be possible that further evidence @-@ like group@@ ings or small groups form , the attack against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee and Att@@ ach@@ ers from other right @-@ to @-@ right modes .
a Germany @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of rect@@ ster@@ ror@@ ism is not visible .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or social network .
there were no wor@@ ried about Ma@@ ate that many over@@ gri@@ ps went to the account of people who did not occur in his right scene .
this is the bes@@ org@@ inal cord .
many of the crime in Att@@ ach@@ ers at Att@@ acken on asylum are not regarded as crimin@@ als , politically le@@ ft@@ me or supporters of the right scene .
so many people have committed themselves , who had not having right on the hat , which were perhaps politically un@@ different or for example , in the CDU , SPD or Lin@@ ke , but have however , however , due to jus@@ tification .

the fees per cubic meters of sewage is from 1st October 2016 for the field of sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ ding &apos; 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 euros ( previous 2,@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euro ( previous 2,@@ 18 euros ) .
if the plant in Az@@ endorf is expected to increase the sewage fee at the latest by then , if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
according to a corresponding limestone , the sewage Prize in Az@@ endorf will be held at 4,@@ 37 euros per cubic meters of cubic meters .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported that the budget was established through the budget of Kul@@ mbach by the district office of Kul@@ mbach found that for these waste water facilities .
the Kas@@ endorf market was obliged to jus@@ tify the basis of jus@@ tification designed to operate the plants .
from October 1 , 2016 the citizens , the business and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ ding , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ tenberg .
the fee increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Corporate Executive Committee , Herbert Schmidt presented a new calendar for the sewage treatment plant in the market .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 also over@@ - and covers from the previous calendar period .
for this , the gra@@ vest@@ ments was established with all three waste water , relatively small and a very low se@@ wer@@ case , which grows between 6@@ 800 and 12000 cubic meters per year .
thus , because of the small circulation facility , for example , expenses for repairs of several thousand euros would have been gra@@ ced .
in addition , the sewage water volume in all three plants is slightly declined .
still in the wake @-@ up period during all three installations , not least because of their age to age and repair work in a serious extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ ding , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth , and Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt proved that in the sewage plant Az@@ endorf , the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a change .
in the pum@@ ping p@@ end , the nearly 20 years of old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led by reason for nearly 20 years in the first sep@@ tic tank , the sewage slu@@ dge has had to be installed and an additional ventilation system to keep the water@@ legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses came to take into account the operations and maintenance costs , which are account according to the new calendar period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which is still considerably below the previous level in the previous year 2011 / 2012 .
stone house made clear that in the small sewage treatment in the three plants take full expenses for the operation and maintenance . &quot;
in the last 20 years , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs were spar@@ ed in the last 20 years .
the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to be done according to view of stone houses . since the supply of the san@@ itation association Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ oc@@ al should not be extended these plants , because it is a deficit .

Sn@@ ap@@ chat &apos;s An@@ ime &apos; effect as an Asian carto@@ ons
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is inspired , but some observer is that there is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel opposite the races .
with its filter tool , it enables Sn@@ ap@@ chat around 150 million daily users to modify the reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way , playing the absur@@ d .
you can turn into an p@@ ine@@ apples , a dog or a figure that could turn from a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings .
the filters are un@@ mistak@@ able , independent tools , which generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ f@@ eit per day .
all benefits from the public to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have moved in the past cri@@ tic@@ ised , in which they were accused that the app Black@@ face conve@@ y@@ ors or white skin would take part as a beauty deal .
when these week some Us@@ ers proposed a filter , which gave them cra@@ mp@@ ed to them , the false teeth and d@@ ge@@ ene W@@ angen gave a ra@@ mp@@ se of cri@@ tic@@ ist on Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow . &quot;
they asked if this repeated statement were revealed on a larger problem that the company is with diversity .
the news and the Emp@@ ations were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Motherboard , one day after sn@@ ap@@ chat on Wednesday that it would have been disabled .
the company offered a resolution : the filter was intended as a homage to An@@ ime characters and not as seen in cartoon by Asi@@ ans .
but outer @-@ standing , the rac@@ is@@ tism had experienced , rec@@ alled the filters of viol@@ ating ring@@ es .
it also opted into the An@@ ime comparison to the An@@ ime comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace au@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et was spread over the photos , that the filter was viol@@ ated and gel@@ mann was un@@ comfortable . &quot;
it added , that &quot; it is difficult to provide the counter@@ fying of a highly controversial Asian carto@@ ons and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter was not long @-@ secured , but that means that the yellow can be moved into the wet extre@@ mi@@ m .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses these cultural Stol@@ per@@ es .
the American culture appears to be wrapped in a endless diversity and integr@@ ations , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and equipment , which we keep all in the hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ril &apos;s great audience of young people - which in terms of race , more than their older counter@@ players are - could be expected to expect them effective .
if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats felt a picture , &quot; so it is much more difficult to stay for such things un@@ noticed , as it was earlier in the case , &quot; said the 25 year old K@@ atie Zh@@ u , in an interview at Thursday .
on Thursday , Zh@@ u decided to ext@@ ingu@@ ish the product manager and engineering in Medium @-@ Medium , called the Sn@@ ap@@ chat account to delete the same on the same .
in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview she said they think that r@@ ust @-@ based control tro@@ duc@@ ed a lack of diversity in the settings of sn@@ ap@@ ing .

they are either a diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they may have people with other skin colors , who work there , but not in positions , in which they are safe or feel free to say what against it . &quot;

the company publishes no numbers on diversity of its occupancy and points to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , there are Sn@@ ap@@ chat to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his collabor@@ ators , but according to a speaker , the company has set a number of personnel that focused on under@@ going civil groups and on internal integration .

military leadership lists IS@@ IS Secret service information , Committee of the convention
military factory of the United States Central Command changed information for an optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic state in Iraq and Syria , when it allowed the actual states on site , reports a committee committee in the convention in a report on Thursday .
the provisional report created by a Task Force , members of the Republi@@ can Committee , Intelligence Service and the military bud@@ get@@ ary , reports of great diss@@ atis@@ faction with Central Command and military intelligence , reported to dis@@ ass@@ ess@@ ments their ass@@ ess@@ ments on the American efforts to fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , just C@@ enc@@ om , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; News Service Information received by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander of the U.S. forces as well as the actual states on site were allowed , and were consistently positive than analyses of other news services , &quot; cited a newspaper article report .
&quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com , is in@@ acceptable to our soldiers , if poor analyses of our political leaders will be presented , &quot; Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , republi@@ can Member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Festival .
the leadership of the Cent@@ Com was as far as the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows particularly permanent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct references to modify the government &apos;s decision to modify the reports that analy@@ zers are exposed to the pressure of their ancest@@ or , an optimistic figure out of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
during the first half of 2015 , there were many Central Command and statements , comments and statements ahead of the Congress clearly positive than the facts &quot; presented the report . &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com members publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s started already in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
after months of investigation , it is quite clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , republi@@ can Congress of Kan@@ sas , in an opinion from Kan@@ sas .
from the mid @-@ year of 2014 to the mid @-@ year 2015 the top of the Central Command has changed the statement by the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq by the mid @-@ year of 2015 .
the Republi@@ cans of the Task Force found the Task Force in the life after being played that analysts participated in regards to the manipulation of reports of the Islamic State .
the report , published on Thursday , will still be completed by more detailed findings , while the investigations will be continued .
in addition , additional investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are carried out by the General Insp@@ ector of the Ministry of Defense in G@@ ange .
democratic members of Intelligence Committee on Thursday their own insights gained with some of the conclusions of the republi@@ can Task Force on Thursday .
in 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com was created a limited trial for the creation of post @-@ poll@@ ut@@ ors of IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , gave the highest level of Dem@@ ok@@ rat , a member of the representative office of Adam B. vessel , in an opinion .
this process , Mr. ship , &quot; del@@ ays extended the release of re@@ ig@@ ning reports , &quot; sc@@ ars by the Mor@@ al and Analy@@ sts , and gave a little space for different types of opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ ps and Dem@@ ok@@ rates gave no evidence on an input of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analy@@ sts as regards a &quot; certain policy report . &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress was published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported by the General Insp@@ ector of the Pentagon that were recorded according to complaints of Cent@@ Com analysts .
L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press Officer of the Pentagon , gave a statement that the Ministry of Defense had no reports of the convention , while the investig@@ ative investigation of the General@@ in@@ spect@@ acle still in the G@@ ange .
but he was also involved , that &quot; experts sometimes even require diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and the news services and the Ministry of Defense welcomed a controversial discussion of the national defence . &quot;
the investigations did back on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
the accus@@ ations of last year , however the question ruled , in@@ wi@@ ped President Obama to the Central Command for honest military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic state must be taken over ten years ago , when the then government of George W. Bush presented the recommendations of many analysis including a small occupying forces in Iraq , and a little time looking forward to make sure about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Ho@@ oker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
in the past year , Mr. Ho@@ oker decided to modify the statements of the government attacks against the Islamic State , as they had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these provisional refin@@ eries were put into operation , to sell oil on the Schwarz@@ markt .
this knowledge was not published , however , the Times reported in September .
on the basis of Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was cri@@ tici@@ zed by members of the Parliament due to its moderate positive assessment of the war .
general Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel was replaced .

five goals in two games should actually have a memorable power , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said that they could not remember that ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not among the people who keep their doors in the memory .
however , this knows it : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and they were also beaten in their group with the Brit@@ on in their first place , after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet each Saturday at the final match of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two finished in their group consists of six teams each , each of the first and second place .
the first placed in the last year becomes somewhat longer out of the way , that lead the other group .
like the game in Saturday , the Americans have triggered her success story by their success story by their success , four years after the last London games played on the last of 12 seats .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
they grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ bat in the hands ( their two older sisters played the sports at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she was the national play@@ ful of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , because they couldn &apos;t qualify for the K@@ ader .
then the year 2012 was , in which it went to her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , a Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team , making things to contact the things for better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change , and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we had not the work to be in London which we have now .
we can rip the ru@@ des completely to around .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the tor@@ ches in the first half of the game with a return supplement from the Middle East .
in India , India was without victory in the game , but the team showed surprisingly tough and kept the playing of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until the game took her hands into their hands .
she carried out a Sprint with the flat ball on the left f@@ lange , then moved to the center and lu@@ te the ball into the gate for the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guide .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez em@@ ony the final gate in the middle of the last four quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the Tor@@ ware , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who so far had to book a gate in every of the previous games .
you has a race .
just like B@@ am .
we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but as well as good will depend on Saturday the next game on Saturday .
in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen the tramp@@ ol@@ ins

you can not read the TV set , a newspaper , or when conversation on your neigh@@ bors in the waiting @-@ hop , without over Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ is@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had to hear .
and then there are Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympics games and a women with regards dim@@ ples , would have been broadcast@@ ed under this known name which can be sent to the Prime Time , provided by sponsors and clean TV advertising if it would be a flo@@ ats , Turner or even F@@ real .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , figh@@ ts in the Olympics in the Olympics .
the Olympic flame lit not every event .
further from the town , partly in the shade are sports , which are not generally accepted : aerial view , arch@@ ery , Bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the breast swim and let it say good@@ bye to the chest .
but if I want to make modest arguments for my specific Lieb@@ ling , then let me know the attention to the discre@@ et@@ able charm of the tramp@@ ol@@ ins .
although the tramp@@ oline had already been a Olympic event since 2000 , when it had been real time since 2000 , the last 16 years so many that I had been inter@@ viewed , did not know that there is a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art at all .
the could also be regional Ig@@ nor@@ ms .
although the US athletes sent to competition , it has never won a Medal in the tramp@@ oline for up to 2012 who had had a athletes until 2012 .
the Chinese and Rus@@ sians are happy to divide the prices for men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans to divide the women for women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend this year &apos;s gold medal in London .
the tramp@@ oline jump has some certain outside @-@ iter@@ ate , partly because it sounds for the un@@ locked ear @-@ matching ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ School as the site for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I don &apos;t want to be an expert but only a few hours of enthusiasts .
it &apos;s humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ onist of its never to s@@ wollen si@@ eve - but also the gra@@ zie of the turn@@ tables and diving that are mainly combines .
the word &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El tramp@@ oline , which means that many means &quot; dive board . &quot;
Emer@@ ging winner on a huge tramp@@ oline , first jum@@ ped up to 30 feet in the air and must have a number of attack@@ ing movements ( turning , h@@ real and sal@@ tos ) before reaching back to the feet .
you will be evaluated according to the official Olympic section series according to execution , difficulty and &quot; Flug@@ time . &quot;
two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio each other .
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
Me@@ da@@ illen@@ hop@@ ing must continue to go with gold , faster , after above and dr@@ on@@ go , sometimes until the target , sometimes and back , after the top and down the playground on the playground .
do not only appear to the finish line or the output wall , but in the television transmission , the world of the world or the Olympic Games .
the targeted stre@@ ak is no@@ vers , admired n@@ s@@ value , even fan@@ atic and it &apos;s enough to stir even an audience in tears .
but it &apos;s also what I want to look at this games as a little da@@ zz@@ l@@ ingly .
the tramp@@ oline offers a breathing space .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ oline spr@@ int is above .
a preliminary movement is not the goal .
he or her pr@@ t , seem@@ ingly heav@@ ist like a astronom@@ er , goes down to the top , then easily back to the top .
there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no h@@ ec@@ tic attack on the goal , not w@@ öl@@ ben into the distance , only the dream , elegant repe@@ al of time and heavy force .
it is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games only .
the quali@@ fiers and final hours of women will be staged on Friday afternoon , in Streaming by 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men of the men on Saturday , also around 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC is displayed as part of a follow @-@ up block of two days from 14.00 to 14.00 .
in the middle of the Olympia Man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , which will probably be shown in the general tum@@ ours .
if the awareness of consciousness can only be reached by the anxiety and the objective of male athletes - as it confirmed the male US @-@ Turner according to the The Wall Street Journal recently sent to the air of Do@@ ol@@ ey the new fan community .
&quot; a Generation &quot; generation &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a federation of the USA
violent Pro@@ est in Ethiopia
protest@@ ers , demonstr@@ ators decided to challenge political changes in Ethiopia , sti@@ cky on violent resistance of the government .
witness should say that remarkable proteins during the cl@@ ashes with the police were killed in Sch@@ uss@@ i .
is Ethiopia just break it ?
over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid co@@ si@@ ders of West Africa with a fast growing economy .
but in the last few months , protests against the government passed the country and far more territories within the past few months .
last week , thousands of people on the streets and desired fundamental changes of fundamental changes .
the response to the government was un@@ stopp@@ able according to human rights organisations .
witness to that polic@@ emen on zig for seventy protest@@ ers were killed and killed .
in circulation , the videos above the protests , which are probably hit by the last or beginning of this year , show young people with sho@@ cks , while these were forced to make a roll against a wall .
the Chief of the UN High Authority on human rights requires a further investigation .
it was always difficult to keep this country , and in the future it will even be more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most influential country of Africa and its stability is estimated at the West .
American military and secret services work closely together with the Ethiopia , in order to tackle the region against the region , in particular against the region , in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , so much western aid .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy is expanding into impressive pace .
its infrastructure has dras@@ tically improved - there is a new p@@ end@@ ancy in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even when Ethiopia was given all other as a model for democracy , human rights organizations have constantly led the repres@@ sion , by the opposition - the opposition in the country was limited to be effective for the silence .
many were sent into exile or in prison , or killed or into the un@@ certain@@ ties of the wilderness .
however , this could change .
&quot; if you press people and these do not have any other options , except , it breaks out , &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ians . &quot;
the whole youth is prot@@ acted .
a generation of prot@@ ector .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from ground use up to the wor@@ shi@@ ppers in terms of power of the coalition .
after a far @-@ reaching election in the year , the Party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and control over 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , the stres@@ ses along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this z@@ ack@@ ing , re@@ mun@@ eration line demanded in June hundreds of life .
analy@@ st fear separ@@ ati@@ sts such as O@@ rom@@ o @-@ liber@@ ate Front , or the National Liberation front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which have been en@@ forced during the past years and could be armed by tur@@ mo@@ il .
several factors explain why feelings from the bit@@ ing after years ago , H@@ ink@@ ö@@ chel@@ ns explo@@ de with the surface now .
the first seems to be harm@@ less : smartphones .
only in the last few years , many Ethiop@@ ian was able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones were more often more common , and the internet services improved .
even if the government considers the access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in test , many people can still communicate with Internet Pro@@ xi@@ es , the s@@ bergen , where they hold up .
several young Ethiop@@ ian announced that they met in Pro@@ test .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic origin in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are no natural enemies .
since the prosp@@ ering of the am@@ har@@ ma , the Am@@ har@@ ma , which come from Et@@ th@@ op@@ i@@ ens , come mainly between the politics and economy , while they are the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are live and live in low@@ land areas .
but that changes the changes too .
&quot; we are doing , under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the largest protests in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and in the military , in the intelligence services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former Reb@@ el@@ leader , was until his death on a non @-@ ordin@@ ated illness in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was regarded as tak@@ ir@@ gen@@ ius , a man who was able to think about corners .
analysts say that it was particularly reversible in it , early signs of diss@@ atis@@ faction and special en@@ forced to work with opponents and to make sure opponents .
&quot; the current regime is missing on this elementary &quot; skill , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st .
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively un@@ interrupted reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of the northern Ethiop@@ i@@ ens , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he did not enjoy the confidence of the Tig@@ ray controlled security services .
many be@@ aming to fear that the result is more blood .
the last time in Ethiopia , in 2005 , following thousands of the elections , in 2005 , after thousands of the elections , according to analy@@ tics , according to analy@@ tics , according to the government , had been stolen and then were stolen .
while the following ra@@ ids were killed many proteins , even if there were less than in the last months and this time the un@@ rest was relatively fast .
development experts of Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure development , such as the new P@@ end@@ ancy , as well as for their measuring progress in the poverty line .
but obviously , this is not the intensi@@ fication of the internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month of fer@@ ries in gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ an town , of Tig@@ ray , shops and hatred , as opposed to the Tig@@ ray will be more common in the social media .
analysts say that the US and other western associations were used in a one @-@ like position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ ement flights across the neighbouring Somalia , even if they were recently closed , they closed this basis .
while the West is clear to support democracy , he will not want to perform that his allies is breaks in a more volati@@ le area .
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin gr@@ at@@ ment . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his alleg@@ ation of Obama , IS@@ IS was founded .
Donald J. Tru@@ mp was tried to provide the last Con@@ tro@@ verse to the last Con@@ tro@@ verse to that his campaign , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the founder of the terrorist group of Islamic State .
these statutes , to communicate new questions concerning the communication skills in the presidential candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , whether he is able to communicate with the American public to communicate with the American public .
it also brings its participation , which could not take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection against the real position that he could not have to have happened .
after graduating from a campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp made a reference to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really didn &apos;t intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton have had IS@@ IS .
but in an early crowd , Mr. Tru@@ mp said , Mr. Tru@@ mp , he is simply s@@ ark@@ as@@ tically .
the twe@@ eter was contrary to the previous day , Mr. Tru@@ mp was said to be a series of interviews , he said that he said the attacks .
the conservative radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp help to help him from something that Mr. Obama IS@@ IS wants to destroy him to know the republi@@ can presidential candidate nothing of them .
the last storm of criticism of Cri@@ ass@@ on , Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he tries to shift the focus of its campaign because of the loss values on the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton held their spe@@ eches of the economic situation in Michigan , this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp was tried again to return on this topic .
on Twitter , he warned on Twitter , that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes , and that he found their speech in bor@@ ing .
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought to his defense in 1935 .
at the end of July , he said to themselves , when he said that Rus@@ sians said , Mrs. Clin@@ tons of E@@ ve , however , explained his &quot; Nat@@ alie , &quot; says the s@@ ark@@ as@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp allows to move the lingu@@ istic borders in politics and then back to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test such a certain messages from his fans how they will arrive : &quot; according to the response , &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , which were observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
but I think also , he is a smart enough to keep up his statements , so that they can be interpreted in various kinds of way .
instead of sound for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has been an additional sound , since its switching values are dropped .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was released on Friday , showed a lead with a big advantage in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tru@@ mp generally tried to understand themselves for his prov@@ okes , he is accused of his critics , he is often common to understand his critic or his hum@@ or .
but while on the focus of attention in the last months of its presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mps have brought his religious situation in the un@@ comfortable situation , irrespective of them , regardless of whom we do his statements .
Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mps promin@@ ence to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview of Thursday .
&quot; I think what he says is legitimate time , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani therefore asked about Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton to the Islamic State .
it is true that Obama IS@@ IS had an almost unknown , small organization that was called back to the hinter@@ land , completely wrong and so it was , because he moved the troops from Iraq .
most Main@@ stream @-@ Republi@@ can try to prevent the government under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , it has allowed IS@@ IS to leave the situation in the Middle East .
before the elect@@ oral events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on media and handed them before , on each of his words a ride and against him .
he poured the &quot; poor , j@@ aw@@ ing &quot; television experts who try to understand Him and said , &quot; You can not understand it ! &quot;
some of the demo@@ un@@ ces potential over Mr. Tru@@ mps de@@ formation considered only one further proof that he is not suitable for the Presi@@ dency .
once more than the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point is returned to Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a shame café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , which you can only pay for any Wi @-@ Fi , but it had no Wi @-@ Fi for 15 years in good coffee .
of course , the prices were ou@@ sted by the prices of its Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ in front .
the Business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , the Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , Sei@@ fe sold in the form of Cup@@ cakes .
native city , it was smoking as a last loss in a ri@@ fied city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ b wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I cannot believe that C@@ BGB was dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a Sei@@ fen@@ nel . &quot;
but if New York change is , then it is also new way .
a revi@@ ved café opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same employees and a similar plain atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ term employee of the old cafés , owner and managing director of the new cafés .
he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained until the end of the end .
when he offered a customer , cash funds for a new outside air conditioning , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , attracted much more .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for Bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso model .
it even uses the same bul@@ bs from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment with this .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are Gar@@ ni@@ es , such as cap@@ ers and s@@ auti@@ ed onions .
there are natural re@@ iss@@ sch@@ an .
the Café is served no beer more , but there is fresh juices .
after nine months of Rodri@@ guez , Rodri@@ guez said that he noticed a direct current of old French customers .
&quot; many old clients were ou@@ sted out by awards from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; said he .
recently , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was a new customer by Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after Green@@ point she had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way to themselves .
after the se@@ b was closed , she gave a while , a while , it said , she said .
it was clear that it was on the coffee and at the culture in Ver@@ b , which was called me , &quot; said it . &quot;
now you &apos;d like coffee , even if they are ordered on this day instead of their usual I@@ ced coffee machine , an Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea ordered , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before work and ordered un@@ interrupted d@@ ass@@ é .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , as a Swiss clock watch and they prepare for my Ever@@ y@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter . &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to implement and record new ingredients into the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal will still be his normal order , but sometimes he changes his Ever@@ y@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with sp@@ eck , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he has no gro@@ omed about Gro@@ ll , that Sei@@ fen@@ nel occupied the old business area .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie has to create a special soap for tast@@ ed coffee with the coffee @-@ placed coffee of the cafes .
&quot; I think , we will still go on their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café also .
a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ guez , he said that he has made it soon , so that his new neigh@@ bors will be welcome .
the location also has further advantages .
a ör@@ t@@ less saf@@ t@@ locally like to fill the bre@@ eze of coffee in bottles and sell .
there is a chance to expand the café on a neighboring building .
for many customers , a new delay from to get their old favor@@ ites to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said the border of the locomotive and a new coffee machine , like a home return .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the rie@@ ve , &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the primitive meal of the economic crisis in &quot; a sub@@ sum@@ ed meal &quot;
shortly after his ascent to President Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took place at O@@ val Office in March 1933 .
as a fine , President Roosevelt was a F@@ ai@@ ble for sophisticated Del@@ ic@@ acies of land , such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mar@@ yland water signs .
his meal on this day was something modest : filled eggs in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , potato p@@ ü@@ ree , and the dess@@ ert a pu@@ pil pu@@ zz@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with wear people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; There was also an message of the Americans , as they should eat . &quot;
the couple living in Brooklyn , and they are both food historian .
the book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; from Chinese Kitchen , while Zi@@ d@@ man in its book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; tells about life in a residence at the Lower East Side of the food .
your latest collaboration , &quot; An active meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrated the history of American kitchen during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sand@@ wich shop , a small , quick dry I@@ mb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the IPO in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh k@@ es@@ and@@ wich with olive tree , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato p@@ ü@@ ree and mixtures .
when the re@@ porter h@@ ack@@ ers ordered , this was the pair found for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
there were earth bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were taken out of an access and a bit of inexpensive , that is the access to access .
set up , so many Earth serve as a supp@@ ose that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E and ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it must have laid down in the stomach as lead , &quot; said he .
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household mainly in rural areas , an all @-@ You Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
cre@@ ws of women k@@ och@@ ten for male rock workers and it was served as a fresh@@ ly past@@ ures for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
the American , Americans sent men during the first World War . &quot; A Square Me@@ al , &quot; out of which the country went into , with which the country did not stop more the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland .
it was a time , in the food for the American , a central theme , &quot; says Co@@ e , why he and his wife had to write his wife . &quot;
the new Bud@@ get@@ ing : the new Bud@@ get@@ ary diet : the mysterious food as a wonderful kind of food as &quot; wonderful kind , food remains re@@ plen@@ ished , &quot; mer@@ ging brick on , as Kö@@ che un@@ expect@@ edly could hide himself under a creative sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by inexpensive dr@@ y@@ clo@@ ob@@ st .
meat , which was the core of the American kitchen , was a rare in the fourth luxury .
a self @-@ like bl@@ ended mixer were tried @-@ filled , since a cal@@ orie rich and wet specimen was jum@@ ped in front of taste or even healthy kitchen .
during her research for the book , which was also recipes includes , set a court from this epoch , geb@@ ack@@ ene onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
it was not a popular addition to the lunch break , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Zi@@ egel@@ mann takes further out : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
Erd@@ n@@ uss@@ butter and burnt onions do not fit each other .
it was typical for many of the folk concepts .
as never before , ag@@ ger@@ ates household appliances - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - The Country Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 .
by making the recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to play &quot; Hou@@ sehold Chemicals &quot; and the challenge , Pamp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals .
&quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; is a festival of historical experience .
in particular , the reports about the response to the aid of the government to the aid of citizens , like President Herbert Ho@@ over@@ s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ food @-@ attitude .
while he was public the simple I@@ owa farmhouse kitchen with his kitchen , sp@@ ste , like the million severe man from the world , which he became .
&quot; he bre@@ e@@ ered kitchen such as fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
it ate in a almost gold @-@ plated dining room and also contributed to .
he was a realistic @-@ horse .
perhaps the same mistakes , when not the same mistakes , when not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to join him with his stomach .
as described in the book , the present day described by a house@@ keeper with no interest in flav@@ ours by Mrs. Roosevelt , that the White House brought the bor@@ ing of food in Washington , but also one of the most difficult meals . &quot;
many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , filled with food , once the country came back on the legs .
the ret@@ ali@@ able is based on our continuing focus on calories and food , the level man , as well as science on food was applied .
the pair gave in writing to the writing of the book the essence of Zi@@ d@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ mother @-@ grand@@ mother , - for example , how they could not take away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she had a true fear of the disappearance of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
brick man remin@@ ded : &quot; she made people really sick . &quot;
there was the wind power by wind power .
after the plate of Eis@@ enberg &apos;s dish were ab@@ sent , they moved away and Co@@ e a dess@@ ert that they had taken away from home : the pl@@ under@@ stands , the President Roosevelt at lunch .
it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ d@@ man and added to that there was a common tri@@ ck , hum@@ ble recipes to miss a send name . &quot;
there were no lubric@@ ating cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
each thri@@ ce a bit contradic@@ ted a spoon into the tough , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
aston@@ ish@@ ness it was not bad .
Co@@ E took place three times in three times .
like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ w@@ ti@@ fier he said to his wife , &quot; A couple chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
on bom@@ bs attack : it was the hero of Ale@@ ppo .
he continued his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life in Syria .
in order to save all the life to save life .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a fac@@ bom@@ bs attack on the Assad regime .
Omar had been a member of the White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil service group , which according to the image newspaper previously had about 60,000 humans .
29@@ 00 volunteers have their own life on the game to drag people from the bom@@ bed houses and to make the first aid in the war .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of civilians , that shows him for a 11 @-@ hour period of salvation out of a house in the ruins of a house , went to the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans to the brilliant picture frame in the grey area of the war .
as a hero , he never seen as a hero , said , according to the picture , &quot; for me , the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I &apos;m going to save life , I think that God looks back to me a mart@@ yr@@ s . &quot;
shortly before Omar even started a attack on the victim , he had spoken in a video over the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter have been subjected to four fac@@ bom@@ bs over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlor@@ gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing .
&quot; we can remove the toxic rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb , so not children play , &quot; cited the image his last words before he died .
the dead@@ ly bom@@ bers of the Assad regime had to meet terr@@ orists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rates is almost 400 years old .
more rarely look at the same time .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie usually come to the surface only in the winter .
after an investigation on board the research project S@@ anna back to the sea .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and is difficult at a distance of 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - till today .
Greenland only got up with 150 years .
at the bottom of the north @-@ Atlantic coast , Greenland on the ground of the North Atlantic Sea in an hour he arrives on an average of 1,@@ 220 metres .
only if it is dr@@ one , the five meters long animal accelerates to s@@ atte 2.6 km / h - and it has a top speed of just as fast as a Rob@@ be .
this kind of lon@@ el@@ ly lifestyle seems to be a sponsor@@ ship for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues took part in the journal Science &quot; in any case by a Greenland hai , who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; W@@ ahn@@ ste , &quot; commented on Alexander Sch@@ ra@@ lein by Max Planck Institute for demographic Research in Rostock this li@@ fes@@ pan well , which means for verteb@@ rates a world record .
in fact , the Evol@@ u@@ tions@@ bi@@ ologist already had long that Greenland are stone .
only a lack of evidence is proof .
Gr@@ ön@@ land ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , finally , in particular , they live in the coast of the coast of Canada , Greenland , Greenland , Norway and top .
because they prefer water @-@ temperatures of the six degrees Celsius , they dive at the surface usually only in winter .
so far more about the lifestyle of Greenland @-@ ha@@ y researchers according to the lifestyle .
her schedule can be adjusted for her time , when they took six animals in front of the peaks of six animals with a transmitter .

Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ y , the fisher@@ man between 2010 and 2013 , to Gr@@ ön@@ land or S@@ val@@ bard for the beginning of the North Atlantic .
the smallest of H@@ ai was just 81 centimeters long , while the largest 502 increases .
in order to determine the age of animals , they analyzed the lens with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this center of ophthalm@@ ologists is already formed before the birth of the Ha@@ ie , which contained the proteins are not renewed later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the liner .
their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s as a nuclear tests , larger quantities of the radioactive carbon in the atmosphere of the atmosphere .
in the with 220 centimeters , the third smallest of the smallest animal in the liner , on the other hand , with a low trans@@ verse to carbon @-@ 14 , are expected to have celebrated its 50th birthday at his study in 2012 .
all of the larger Greenland swe@@ eping forces in their liner shape the normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts , which creates by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 is actually demonstrated at an age of 4@@ 93 centimeters in Greenland for an age of 335 years , while the record H@@ ai was going to be 3@@ 92 years old even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Gr@@ ön@@ m@@ hai @-@ females only gets up , when they are longer than four meters , known .
now the researchers of the length could be assigned an age .
as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters probably died at the threshold of sexually mature and his age with 156 years , Greenland @-@ ha@@ y has been determined at least one and a half centuries ago .
even that is currently the world record for verteb@@ rates are currently world record .
such that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live primarily in e@@ ater waters , is not a co@@ incidence .
also the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Greenland , in its sp@@ eck at N@@ acken , a 120 @-@ year @-@ old hard@@ hall@@ mark was caught in front of Alaska .
through the low temperatures , the organis@@ m is often found on fire retard@@ ant there .
so , then , and al@@ ak@@ ening slow .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals will also often keep very large .
because the volume is growing much faster than its surface , due to the animal heat .
the heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than at a gram of elephant .
one another advantage : you have less enemies .
if a smaller animal lives , so many descendants live , preferably as many descendants , &quot; explains the evol@@ ution@@ bi@@ ologist Sch@@ ult@@ lein . &quot;
a very big animal was to invest its resources rather in a long life .

Scotland , Call@@ um Sk@@ internal ra@@ est last evening in the male team @-@ Sprint in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio is going to fame , when the British Team took the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor of a man who made his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y . he made a legend , and made a legend , when he over@@ threw his home to a victory of the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
four years ago , England was stressed a sho@@ cked victory , while Ho@@ y took the fifth of the six Olympi@@ ag@@ old@@ ers .
she repeated the tri@@ ck , after taking place at the World Championship in London in March , despite the return flight Ho@@ ys just a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the cycl@@ ers Jamie Staff .
they did in time as an execution .
Ho@@ ys &apos;s retirement , a gap , the Ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton were trying to close .
Sk@@ internal was the man in which they stayed , when they saw the potential in the sh@@ ots , which now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y victorious and Sk@@ internal in the quali@@ fications round a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord , but in the top row the New Zealand was victorious in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der was barely back after his round , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ internal .
a strategy change also made a major part of the transformation in which the execution in a higher gear used to allow him to slow down and keep pace , and especially Sk@@ internal to keep pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC expert , and was Sk@@ internal , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they were on the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ internal from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a sh@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I have only been here to do my best and make me a name .
we have set up a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was simple .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 , Ho@@ ys , and Ho@@ ys gave himself to that he dropped to a weak start .
he moved this statement later , and there was no obj@@ ecting of England &apos;s rival .
with such a winning victory there was no problem this time .
Hin@@ der said , &quot; it &apos;s feels like to play with all the GB flags on the tri@@ way like London . &quot;
in the last three months , we have joined the team in the last three months .
we are so bad at such a lot of world score that it was incredibly , once again at the Olympic Games .
this is an event to be a gold medal for the nation that were seven out of 10 titles in Beijing and London .
if the bar ometer of our progress in the last five months is that we expect a successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of the possibility it is in the area of the possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
this would be the position for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on 23 March , was also born on the day of British sports ; Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) - an yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the cheese is equal to Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint part , which begins today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I have engineering into this only for the moment . &quot;
the team Event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something to win alone alone .
hin@@ der said , &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only Me@@ da@@ illons competition of the day , but there was another good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll are qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they came to 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
the world record , who won gold in London in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be taking place on the second day of the competition , at the Wig@@ gins with security in focus .
in spite of the representative of the quali@@ fier , he had taken the function as a function to measure his body @-@ size .

the future of melting of Port@@ land due to the repe@@ ti@@ bility of the contract
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand in the game , since the system operators are able to cancel the energy sector , making all the supply agreements , such as the energy sector .
this step was followed by the decision by the Government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies for operation of the plant .
a maximinum payout of 20 years is running a maximinum payout of November .
up to 2000 jobs in the complex of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land stand on the game .
not less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - could be endanger@@ ed with a closing .
in addition , it could come to Domin@@ o@@ effects , as the melting consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry melting , which led last year to a closing of Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant .
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land is money and ris@@ ked for closing .
this step follows in @-@ long spec@@ ulations in the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which delivers large aluminum down with his Lo@@ y Yang A power station in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , that it assumes that three more owners will be able to announce its contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , from which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC , and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to be operated by Port@@ land , which means a further physical demand for electricity by the melting means , &quot; divided the company with .
AG@@ L continued to continue that the contracts called &quot; backup shops , &quot; which should come into force from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of subscription , so that they will start in 2017 .
&quot; from therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; said the electricity supply .
all potential effects on AG@@ L will be limited to AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 , due to the projections of strong sched@@ ules for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L showed that the value of the contracts had already been written in its annual rainfall in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation &quot; .
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melting , or to ensure the power supply to the melting process . &quot;
the US company said that it had completed a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who had come into effect from November this year , even if there is still a statement , why it has re@@ signed from the contract .
analy@@ st , due to the poor economic circumstances in the sector before the possible closing of the port of Port@@ land in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land is around 600 meg@@ awatts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ awatts of electricity annually .
if both systems should disappear from the market , accounting would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as a generator , it would not be good , &quot; he said .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey before countries elections : SPD and CDU ,
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , considerable losses for the control party of the SPD and CDU .
this resulted in a representative surveys of opinion research institute In@@ sa for the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper &quot; ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north could be further strengthened , this is not possible after the fra@@ gment in Berlin .
the SPD was the SPD , but the SPD was the strongest party in both the federal states , and it would have been good chances to increase the government of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD ranged from 35@@ ,@@ 6 percent to 24 percent prior to five years ago .
the party so that according to the survey , only just before the CDU , could rise again to 23 percent .
the third place is controversial between the Left and the Af@@ D .
the lin@@ ke ma@@ me was 19 per cent ( earlier 18,@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented with 19 percent for the first time in the country .
despite its mild losses , despite a slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.7 percent ) , the green landscape was once again .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP are represented with 3 per cent in the Land@@ tag .
according to the Berliner &apos;s candidate selection , the SPD was estimated to be found only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
however , the CDU achieved only 18 percent after 2@@ 3,4 percent .
so that the Gre@@ ens continues with 19 per cent ( in 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be at 14 percent for the first time in the national park .
at 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return to a return , the pir@@ ates would be to miss in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
email and internet in time @-@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came on the market .
the successor domin@@ ate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a Des@@ aster .
the device weighed almost half a kilogram , and was more than four times as difficult like a iPhone 5 .
it was di@@ cker and larger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite expensive .
the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning of eight Meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would be today for approximately two un@@ ths with a high resolution .
the iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ yte .
the Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; was exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the business - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros you can buy the devices still in the Internet , but they come from the stone @-@ time of the Inter@@ network .
however , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation for 20 years ago .
the product of Finnish mobile phone manufacturers had previously announced a few months prior to the computer fair C@@ ebit in Hanover as &quot; office in the West@@ ent@@ ative format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was sent to the time a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent , and receive , by fax it was the Communic@@ ator .
even the access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers , even if qu@@ el@@ end .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and a electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be similar to a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen found .
quite proud of the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average sale price of a smart phones in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could happen in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator of the beginning of the smartphone era would be .
ever since everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story if not suitable for Nokia .
the phone division of the Fin@@ n experienced an unprecedented des@@ aster , was finally sold at Microsoft .
today , the market is able to open all much later than Nokia .
always , and everywhere , that is now for many people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smart users worldwide .
some 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple alone , 5@@ 55 million were sold .
the worldwide revenues generated with the devices is around 400 billion euros .
as a result , the well @-@ running business of the zah@@ ll@@ ables App providers and tel@@ ecom services will come .
around the smartphone now has been developed by a whole industry .
the decisive breakthrough for the mass market came at the beginning of 2007 , then the Apple CEO Steve Jobs at the Mac @-@ World for the introduction of the iPhone .
he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communication , all with touch screen easily .
the victory of Apple started , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , which had been ruling on the market .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry finally disappeared .
the s@@ ages now have Apple and Asian suppliers such as Samsung .
smartphone is 20 years after its invention .
in the cut , each German has now spent 88 times a day on the phone .
&quot; we need to learn all the way to pick up the smartphone , just Jan@@ ina ball , said to the Siemens @-@ Executive Board for staff .
permanent health care is now considered the curse of the curse and blessing in the same time .
England has to expand the Olympic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row .
He@@ ath@@ row is not only involved in our local commun@@ es and in London , but in all the country of renewal and prosperity .
for me , it was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as at that time , in London , when we have a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions have benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympic Games brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be reached again by we create new possibilities for local and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local commun@@ es , we are already able to create 40,000 new jobs , create 40,000 new jobs , and the youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were in London 2012 , it will be such that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is big .
I said that England has never been ready for the games , and that we will be given us on the world stage .
the doub@@ ts was in 2012 Un@@ right and they are wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obst@@ acles to the disappearance , but He@@ ath@@ row answered each other .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not an infrastructure project .
extension is an option to create up to 18@@ 0.000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to create a we@@ ful growth and a legacy of abilities , and to leave employment both to the airport as well .
we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has been a budget of £ 11 billion between the T5 , which was built five years in a row as the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequ@@ ented running cat@@ walks in the world .
now they are ready to supply a third run ste@@ g , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investments .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is also one of his .
it is time that we expand this Olympic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row and create our future trading with regard to our future trading and employment , and create employment that can be proud of England .

the fact that the world &apos;s largest companies have left the fight for social media in the fight , is a strong indi@@ scri@@ pture in the industry , and has become ob@@ struc@@ tible display for the industry .

at the Thursday , Facebook that Ad@@ blocks of new filters would be angry because they would also be content on the side , who don &apos;t have any advertising .

but it remains , however , if one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a summary of avoi@@ d@@ bar ?
that is something that the prosecutor has to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver should not be pulled to the responsibility .
in each of the two cases - in which a person in the dark on the highway - was decided that the drivers do not have to go out of them , is the pedestri@@ ans in the night at the motorway , as it was named in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ eman of life was acqu@@ itted , after they had a man over@@ ride and killed , who came to Pay@@ erne a night on the A1 in the vicinity of Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .

NASA climate amo@@ dell : Venus was once be@@ yed
the Venus was according to the project of a new NASA climate model probably once being able .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus and algorithms to discover those of climate control .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus with their hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 tight atmosphere , a similar conditions could be revealed .
scientists previously announced that the slow turn of Venus could be declared through their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin , a similar atmosphere might have had over and slowly .
the model illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the Planet proved probably more dry areas than the earth , but had once enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and shine before the evap@@ or@@ isation .
the early Venus benef@@ ited from a sun , which was 30 percent matter .
in the G@@ ISS @-@ model simulation , the slow turn of Venus will exp@@ ire their daily side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io , in a press release .
this is heated to the surface and produced rain , that is a thick layer , which acts as a rain screen , in order to remove the surface of the majority of the solar heating .
the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than the Earth today .
the model brought a history of Venus , that resem@@ bles the evolution , which was suspected of planning to have been estimated .
although it was probably hit , Venus -- was exposed to a lot of heat and ultra @-@ violet light in the course of several billion years .
its oceans is evap@@ or@@ ated and it evap@@ or@@ ated by the ultra @-@ violet light .
when her hydro@@ therapy , a thick atmosphere remains only a thick atmosphere of the carbon dioxide with a dead@@ ly effect - Venus , which as we know it today .
the researchers put the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .

you now turn to the fastest .
at peak rot@@ ational rates , this one @-@ stars large amounts of stars are made of star@@ ved .
since this winch is traveling by the stars of the stars , they have a bre@@ e@@ worthy effect on the stars .
when a star is age , starts its rot@@ rate is slow down .
Ke@@ pler &apos;s the rot@@ rate of any ster@@ ns by changing the time between the appearance of a testimony -- such as sun fl@@ ash@@ -- .
the latest catalog of rotation rates shows that the massive star slower than less massive star is less than a few massive star .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ters as smaller .
in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ ades we see that slow ro@@ tors for@@ c@@ ors to be massive , while even faster ro@@ tors , said to be very bright stars , said Reb@@ ull .
since the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades are close as close , it serves as a perfect basic laboratory to compare these qualities as a rotation rates .
the star cluster of Ple@@ j@@ ades provides an anchor for the theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
it &apos;s even a lot in front of us about we would like to know how how do , W@@ ann and War@@ um stars their rotation rates have slow down their own &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , which will soon be published in the astr@@ ono@@ tic Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eb@@ all @-@ star becomes a controversial Bas@@ eb@@ all @-@ star .
tears of tears were lower than the US @-@ Bas@@ eb@@ all @-@ Star in the best days of base .
after his emotional return journey , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will take off on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay R@@ ays a last time the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; &quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say good@@ bye to &apos; good@@ bye to &quot; the 14 @-@ year @-@ old All @-@ Star participants of the major League Bas@@ eb@@ all ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es of the World Series .
his signature under a tenth year agreement with a year of 27 million US dollars annually , under a tenth year of 2006 .
by the end of the contrac@@ ting on 31 December 2017 , he acts as a consultant and youth coach - at full content .
when players paid a long time with performance back at the time .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ us &quot; ) for Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 @-@ 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ er ( 2001 @-@ 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed to sell some mile@@ stones .
with the Hall of F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie ma@@ ys have only two further bas@@ eb@@ all players in the main statistics similar values .
however , in the rest of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old still should not be included .
because so successfully Rodri@@ guez - the nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - in the field was cont@@ ested , the appearance is outside the square .
the super@@ star of the &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; already announced in 2009 between 2001 and 2003 , the ster@@ oids had taken place .
in August 2013 , he was locked in a field of bio@@ gen@@ esis @-@ sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ guez is regarded as the principal suspected of having received years of an anti @-@ aging clinic in South @-@ Florida .
after a legal proceedings the sper@@ re was reduced to 162 meetings .
for the year 2014 , the league could even have a gradient of all done for the year 2014 , because I played 20 years without break , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez at the time .
also his departure for days are not no@@ is@@ eless in days .
while many bas@@ eb@@ all @-@ legends during their last games even got the great stage , Rodri@@ guez had to sit down on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a spac@@ ed tour . &quot;
&quot; my job contains the attempt to win any game , &quot; says Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
at least Rodri@@ guez , who was married to the actress Cameron Di@@ az who had to be married with a pop star Madonna and the actress K@@ ate Hudson , the fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee Arch@@ riv@@ als Boston , Red So@@ x .

in Ch@@ en the Di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de has been proved last Sunday , which is used as m@@ ask@@ ier@@ y means for deriv@@ atives .
the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CA@@ S confirmed the Friday morning local time to join the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday , the 18 year old won the fourth place in the final about 100 m butter@@ ling , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds , they missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to attend the performance of more than 50 m Fre@@ isti@@ l .
in the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) the opening of the B sample and an attack is requested .

for the first time in history is no longer the IOC , but the CA@@ S is responsible for an im@@ position of athletes with positive cases .
also on the night of Rio sick@@ ness the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , by the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible Scho@@ ck , &quot; said they told the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
it was not guilty , &quot; the only statement could be dietary supplement &quot; stated the track .
according to the report , it is said to negoti@@ ate the substance substance to the blood of the blood @-@ dop@@ ing EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was temporary down , according to B@@ NT , should also be positive in the B sample already .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister , Boj@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w , died immediately with criticism of the athlete ;
I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ s@@ men are not the correct mud , &quot; said : &quot; we are Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many are excluded . &quot;
so , about all wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter from the chron@@ ically absor@@ bs will not participate in Rio .

Dat@@ enk@@ lau : such per@@ fi@@ de er@@ pressing h@@ acker will benefit your Lö@@ se@@ money
program@@ mer of Er@@ it@@ ungs @-@ Malware is currently specifically targeted and are successfully implemented .
according to a current survey conducted by the malware Anti @-@ Year Speci@@ alists in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 per cent of surve@@ yed companies have been at least once , partly several victims of a Att@@ achment with Er@@ press@@ er software .
in Germany , nearly 20 per cent of companies were already taken part of a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware replacement .
40 per cent of victims paid by the perpet@@ rat@@ ors required by the perpet@@ rat@@ ors to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors are visu@@ alize their Er@@ press@@ er software according to the observations of Mal@@ chi@@ ab@@ ytes and Att@@ ach@@ in company networks .
they are successful there , the potential to be significantly higher than in private users .
we will see a terri@@ fying evolution of the poll@@ ut@@ ants . &quot; we are explained that Mal@@ ch@@ ytes @-@ chef Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski explains in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then discovered the perpet@@ rat@@ ors software for themselves .
only were private useful purpose , but the change to the company took place in the past few months .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , you are searching for a long changed files such as W@@ ord@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as to archives from images and videos .
these files encrypted the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and er@@ ases the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
then the software presents the requirements of the Er@@ press@@ er .
to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims of money - mostly in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ assing bit@@ coin - have to be over@@ seen .
but where in private users the personal Photo database is based on the game , it is concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
according to the damage , if a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is needed .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 percent had to break the business activities in a risk of life .
in Germany , several hospitals were already threatened by many hospitals , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of nurse .
&quot; we say the victims always : pays tribute to , you only promotes the problem , &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ z@@ yn@@ sky .
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies who are to pay their data .
for managers , it is difficult to set the demand of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors in view of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know the h@@ ack@@ ers again and try to build a good reputation .
in a current study conducted by F @-@ Secure , the pay@@ load areas and contact with compres@@ sors and come on contact with the results : the perpet@@ rat@@ ors try to build a kind of customer service to increase more money .
you declare to reduce their victims by chat as they can pay via Bit@@ coin , free to access support websites , or de@@ cryp@@ t free example files .
and if private people went to payments of a few hundred euros , must share some hard negoti@@ ate and five digit sums up to date their data .
in view of the potential high and relatively risk @-@ risk profits from the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware compres@@ sors , the work of the Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ewski contributed by the antivirus market SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
it is however prob@@ able that it is about three or four people .
the program@@ mer sell their damage software in the form of a software building on the actual relief .
the previous malware @-@ K@@ its were created by which the malware infection has also purchased , advice and additional tools for one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
included is an adjustment tool that can be changed , so smaller configurations , appearance , and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski .
the Er@@ press@@ er are looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the fresh@@ ly purchased software under the victims .
we live in an service industry .
it takes you to install in one of the sub@@ en in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a det@@ ective and t@@ asked to install the software on many PCs as possible .
the payment is made per infected machine .
&quot; usually , the det@@ ective and then spoke of the diss@@ em@@ ination with the diss@@ em@@ ination , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski .
the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now known for many companies who want to secure their data .
over 50 per cent of companies @-@ IT companies are able to trust in the Mal@@ o @-@ survey survey on R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware using file back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
according to the perpet@@ rat@@ ors already follow new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is no sufficient threat for successful re@@ ess@@ ments , threat@@ ens the perpet@@ rat@@ ors instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or pri@@ cing , &quot; explains Mal@@ ch@@ ytes @-@ chef Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ z@@ yn@@ sky .
thus , the damage potential is higher than before , according to the type of data still than before .
also , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors could have completely new goals in the internet of things on the body .
on the Hack@@ ney &apos;s Conference , the safety researchers demonstrated how they could receive a thermostat under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of a so @-@ called heating could be a man@@ age@@ victim to be money .
if the perpet@@ rat@@ ors then work instead of the heating in the future offers all production road in a factory block , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware could also be an issue in the Industry 4.0 .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and handy . Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and handy .
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda will un@@ pack it all : a little SUV , a little bit and even the versatility of a mini@@ vans .
sounds pretty good , yet the HR @-@ V , which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz , has actually been extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V has a small HR @-@ V rather small , the passengers have much space both in the first row as well as in the rear , it acts close to none .
the materials of the inside space are well processed and are pleas@@ antly , only the cockpit top is because there is something .
versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage room .
it is not only a trunk diameter of 453 l at highly made and 10@@ 26 l with converted back rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magic , as it sounds : the seat area of the back bank can be folded and therefore offer storage space , which is high from the bottom to the ceilings 1,@@ 24 m high .
the trunk area is well @-@ loaded , however the load height with 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ litre diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he should be somewhat qui@@ eter for his work .
the all @-@ day fuel consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is another motor ori@@ zation : a 1.5 litre petrol model with 96 kW / 130 hp .
all four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the chassis is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
however , the steering is likely to be direct .
the equipment is not open to the tested top model &quot; Executive &quot; in the tested top version .
the safety systems belongs to the city emergency braking system ( works up to 32 ) , the coll@@ ision system and trace heating system .
the coll@@ ec@@ war@@ ns is sometimes , because it &apos;s rated many obst@@ acles than &quot; her@@ ann@@ elling objects . &quot;
very reliably works the remote light assistant .
and the intelligent speed regulator re@@ acts on the traffic detection and d@@ ros@@ sel@@ ing on demand .
the full connectivity is available but only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch tou@@ ch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ integration and more .
two USB@@ - and a HDMI socket are under the rest and are therefore slightly in@@ comprehen@@ sible .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel is fine .
who does not want to invest a lot to invest the petrol engines from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .

if Stra@@ ft &apos;s faster the country would have to leave , increase the safety and the strength of the population to the refugee policy .

video surveillance is to be improved , the tru@@ est to be implemented so above all the purchase of weapons on the Internet .
the last much discussed silence , for doctors said to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères in words .
however , he wants to seek to search for solutions in the dialogue with the doctors of medical , like the haz@@ ards of citizens should be reduced , he said with a look at the psych@@ ic collection .
in order to prevent a radi@@ alization of refugees , the ministers keeps a better social support for necessary .

de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning a deployment of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) plant .
the SPD chef Gabriel said : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that in order to increase security further . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Minister of Justice had been deci@@ ding at action against shareholders .

better traffic flow at the motorway junction
there is a regular basis on the re@@ wards road - here a picture from November .
however , this is supposed to change : the legal requirement is to be extended .
this is a good news for all car drivers who stand in the traffic on the street in St@@ au every evening when they ride on the motorway for Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road vehicle is extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer street and exit Wes@@ eler street , the right lane of 700 meters .
drivers can expect directly from the hammer road to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is early as early as early as early as the total length of the well @-@ known section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the Province of Münster @-@ West .
the road@@ way on the Zu@@ br@@ inger led the driver , mainly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
from the return to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way , and sometimes also beyond the Alber@@ slo@@ her path .
the reason is the needle bell on the B 51 short before departure .
from here , traffic only occurs on the road only to the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be back good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations showed that the bridge did not exceed the required load capacity , in order to record the heavy load two tracks .
like long these Eng@@ pass , as long as this Eng@@ pass and the associated daily St@@ au @-@ stop will not be announc@@ ements .
however , with years to say : for the bridge has a official residual duration of up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal status , the country has sought refuge in school holidays in school holidays because with disabilities .
the transport will be over by the building on Tuesday and Wednesday on Wednesday .

relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening , one turns for eternal , at night , in the morning there is no more hours before the wake of the wake , it is not possible to think about sleep .
it &apos;s all other as a relaxing .
anyway , the case of such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch @-@ Institute , about a quarter of adults of adults and more than ten percent can be found their sleep often or permanently .
how do not express me or sleeping disorders ?
there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there are many different causes underlying , emphasises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ alth , member of the German Society for Schla@@ ff@@ ing , and Medicine .
what is what you understand , is the In@@ som@@ ites , thus an input and a sleep distur@@ bing .
just the le@@ ep can sleep many people as un@@ certainty , or un@@ stopp@@ able , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the German Hou@@ sehold association with practice in Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleeping disorders are complex .
behind , organic , psychological , or @-@ related factors , but also drugs are needed .
no rarely is the illu@@ sion of any other disease .
&quot; very early se@@ w@@ ak@@ ening , particularly with depression , &quot; says We@@ eks . &quot;
and it may be possible that various factors are needed .
for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , bad , aw@@ aken all two to three hours , and starts every two to three hours , with respect to an all @-@ day problems , and ensure an example , in case of course , We@@ eks , is an example .
this leads to the voltage , and sleep is no longer possible .
from when you should work with sleeping disorders to the doctor ?
who does not have a period of one month in at least three nights per week and the day should be imp@@ acted as a doctor should go to We@@ ak .
the fun@@ ic@@ ity can look completely different : one is beaten , tired , un@@ marked paths , has difficulties with the attention and the concentration , is easily accessible , tuning fluctu@@ ations or physical complaints such as Mag@@ i or head@@ aches .
to prevent the sleeping trouble , it is important to figure out their causes .
as a treatment options , including behavi@@ oral changes , a co@@ gni@@ tive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medicine - classical ins@@ ets , only in the exceptional cases and most for two weeks - infrastructure .
in Germany , specialized in Germany , Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary chair of the Char@@ ité University of the Char@@ ité University in Berlin .
for this reason , you should first contact with sleeping problems at first , in addition to other problems .
it can clari@@ fy whether the problems may have a physical cause .
who was to sleep in the sleeping lab , and what happened here ?
for example , in the sleeping lab , medicine for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , in case of anti @-@ smo@@ kers , at ins@@ ane , or when you don &apos;t change the cause of a sleeping bag , says Fi@@ etze .
at the examination , you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please make any lunch sleep , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after passing , you go into the bed one at his normal time .
in addition to the electrodes of the body , one Nas@@ al glasses , a chest strap and a fl@@ ash@@ ers at the finger .
in addition , there is also a camera on the ceiling of the ceiling .
how can your problems in the handle ?
there are quite a lot of parking , where you can set for a better sleep .
We@@ eks has to sleep on : regular sleeping and stand , not to sleep in bed , on the day not sleeping , not to sleep on the sleep , alcohol , and night not on the clock - then it starts immediately to be reck@@ oned , and that is quite in@@ compatible .
what the Jaz@@ ung@@ el@@ camp with missing medals in swimming .
the former German swimming pool Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has sold by Facebook to dis@@ appoint@@ ing the DS@@ V teams at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he picked up Gold champion in Doha for the first time in Doha and exhibited his first world record at the same time .
now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler via Facebook protecting his ing in criticism in the criticism of the Ex @-@ team .
no one year , in a country where a Olympi@@ asi@@ eger 20,000 € will get no € 150,000 € , no one should perish by missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old in the night to Friday on his Facebook page .
the conveying system in the swimming sport is poor , the di@@ op@@ ing@@ controls are very good .

airport : Ban@@ de of baggage is arrested
professional Di@@ ebe to the Düsseldorf airport
civilian population of the Düsseldorf police successfully managed the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the facts were held as Ban@@ de several T@@ asch@@ i and baggage alloy steels .
at 21.@@ 30 p.m. , the civilian officials in the area of the airport Düsseldorf was a Ban@@ de again which was known as the polic@@ emen from last for@@ tifications .
the two women and two men had been committed to several del@@ ik@@ te in mid @-@ July of this year and were practic@@ able , workers , and especially professional .
the specialists &quot; Cri@@ me Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can follow the di@@ cial that they had entered into Germany for the fun@@ eral of criminal charges in Germany , four de@@ eds .
in total , they had exploited a total of more than 15,000 euros .
alto @-@ constructions , a couple of Lin@@ den@@ ns , by still a rest of the band : the Rig@@ as Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain works at first glance , but the police does not count to the &quot; dangerous areas &quot; of the city .
the road from the East to the west along , one comes to play@@ grounds , a visitor &apos;s children &apos;s garden and one bi@@ ol@@ ades .
inspired by the facade of a gray house , someone can be spra@@ yed . &quot;
opposite a Li@@ dl , who will soon be disman@@ tled soon : until 2017 , there will be a house with high windows and 133 new flats .
article about this &quot; trendy Born district , &quot; how the real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain is listed in the last weeks , however , preferred by burning cars .
the house with the number 94 : once was occupied , meanwhile the residents of rental contracts , on the ground floor are still occupied rooms and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , H@@ enkel has been a tough demonstration of the police against the project , as &quot; no @-@ Go @-@ zone &quot; as a &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ zone &quot; for police officers and 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
after 22 June the rooms on the ground floor which were organised by the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , three weeks prior to official report , took part in the village , sper@@ sed parts of the road , and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile building construction workers on behalf of the unknown house owners the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the company had been illegal and had been under@@ gone by police and workers under the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ isers and inhabitants .
at this summer time the street is peaceful : parents walk with children &apos;s walk , people sit on the side@@ walk before the houses in the sun , and so far to the late summer of late summer .
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects there are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left Viol@@ ence is not the essenti@@ als of many occasions : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , which has been living in the pine since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who comes here three children , especially from the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the skin project , they divide the concern before growing and de@@ centr@@ ing .
it sounds not after a pine that wished to be a majority @-@ owned police in front of v@@ and@@ ali@@ lie Left .
the gra@@ bs , den of the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator and the police make it between house and their neighbours , exists so apparently .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ workers , which is today compared to the rest of the city as a lower average income and high poverty line .
home offices and those born @-@ born residential projects have been occupied for pine : in 1990 , many houses were occupied by the former GDR , almost all the entire ma@@ zer street near the Rig@@ as near the Rig@@ as .
while the Main@@ zer were trained at a big police battle , many of the projects were destroyed during the Rig@@ as and were still inhabited by the people which they were occupied by the people before 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has increasingly becoming a magn@@ ets for tourists and elect@@ oral liner from all over the world : with them parts from the GDR @-@ times and former house network have become their pine .
this makes even during the di@@ ets , that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ as symbols are attacked as symbols for these development : they can be seen on sli@@ ces of discs or fresh@@ ly printed fac@@ ades , which were exploited with colour flow .
no other street was mentioned this year so often with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
the reason why not all the neigh@@ bors who believe it as a problem that they are not affected by the crimin@@ ality , statistics such as body viol@@ ate , statistics nearly exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the biggest part of the dis@@ ruption make non@@ damaged damage , the ten@@ sions rather the newly built and fresh@@ ly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , which is living for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94 , cannot be given any speech .
as a result of violence , it is infin@@ itely variable : the people in the 94 are its neigh@@ bors who have not been determined .
even the famous burning cars give it directly in the Rig@@ as no longer .
for an architectural architect , this is no close focal point on its opposite , on the contrary , &quot; here one helps each other , living on the street and gets more independent of one another . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has moved to the Rig@@ as road and stayed in the Rig@@ as road .
as a consequence , it was so important that the people will return their streets : from the police , politics and media , which in July all suddenly the Deut@@ é@@ dies suddenly appeared on the district .
but in the eyes of berries such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : through the sl@@ um@@ less new@@ buildings built in former construction , which re@@ plen@@ ish the old residents .
according to the fact that Property apartments , which are not interesting for many here - there are rather people who are not so well affected , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction , I am absolutely not gu@@ ilt . &quot;
but what should you do because if a never want to hear ?
there is also one of the police and the inhabitants on all sides .
for more inf@@ amous , about colour bom@@ bs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding of understanding : the skin projects and the left scene were belonged to the pine .
whoever lives , should be aware of his - just like someone who draws in a pub district , there is a little noise about noise .
all only have been presented with the person names , don &apos;t have to be called with their correct name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le is a new refugee camp
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the response in terms of integration and organis@@ er .
in addition , she is a social worker in the place .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le has been en@@ forced to refugees to Ur@@ bach .
the social educ@@ ator has been supporting the management team at Achim Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees as a response in contact for all actors : refugees , German refugees , administration , authorities and who are even mit@@ es .
Reg@@ ine customer of the German states that the honorary capacity can be thank@@ ful more than thank@@ ful , Deu@@ ver@@ le now is , the ei@@ ves of Woll@@ mil@@ l@@ au , which has mostly a problem .
in such a few - less sp@@ ies as much more than the multitude of desire may be targeted at targeted - , when the administration wanted to write the position .
we are looking for a administrative management with a talent for Langu@@ ages and people , associated with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , and a ei@@ ving of pure mil@@ j@@ ig@@ au .
but administrative work was not her central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it will go to the organization , work with people on site and also behind the scenes and network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been running since around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent place on three years .
it was the highest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le hon@@ ors and principal directors are supported .
there are large and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and communication problems .
soon the containers are in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem , it has been recognized for some time to find apartments for the connecting blade .
the commun@@ es are responsible for the connection of the municipalities .
they have to accommodate the refugees in own or rented residential rooms .
the costs for the construction , the rent or renovation of these accommodations have to carry out the commun@@ es itself .
the responsibility is moving from the county office to Commune and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search for some time has been very difficult for a lot of time .
the administration has no private apartments .
you do not have so far not so far to work on private apartments , van@@ Deu@@ t .
therefore , we need to be over@@ thrown , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be installed in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it &apos;s not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , are Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le .
in addition to a fixed lead , the training courses , training courses , school places , A @-@ euro jobs and temporary activities for refugees and migrants , have to be folded or set up .
&quot; more places were good &quot; , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many work in the building yard or help house , work @-@ profit making work - and motiv@@ ating and very well , such as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
you hopes that the work has to be a positive external effect on the basis of a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but not only work .
the day require a fixed structure , say Deu@@ ch@@ le and customer .
people need to develop a set @-@ up experience .
so need it offers special features such as sport , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
so well jump here and honorary publications .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling you wish to wish it and welcome them in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you need to explain the refugees that it takes about and it can be meaning@@ ful time , for example with language courses .
who would like to help out the feeling of evolution , he could not work in Ur@@ bach ni@@ em@@ anden , do not work yet and be in@@ non@@ sense that will never be able to integrate it .
the significant majority is motivated .
however , there is also , customer hon@@ est@@ ly hon@@ est@@ ing , &quot; people who certainly doesn &apos;t matter . &quot; the work of Deu@@ ch@@ le and customer is therefore always motiv@@ ating .
the everything is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : both of the recent facts were afraid of radic@@ alization and radic@@ alization , also in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; No , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; what man@@ cher n@@ ai@@ v do like . &quot; a residual risk could not include , and do not include them .
sensitive the hel@@ pers are sensi@@ tively sensitive to the hel@@ per .
these events are also subject to refugees in the refugees .
that had the fear that the attack is completely included in the call them .
you want to show that they have nothing to do anything , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so , main and honorary visits to place and in the region will hold out in the region .
they always have always in the background that soon , a new stored on refugees and Mig@@ ran@@ ts could come to Ur@@ bach .
needs Germany ?
this question is clear to answer the policy : politics .
actually , it &apos;s un@@ fair to pursue hel@@ pers on site .
in Ur@@ bach we are not yet arrived , where we would like to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher also has already been able to integrate the previous people are reasonable .
that are currently about 100 people , mostly young men .
but when people in need to help them , both women are in need .
the political world &apos;s political situation is complicated , since there is no simple responses .
