<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: IT's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">In infrastructure, in infrastructure and the trade agreements of TTP - this would like to be Clinton as well as Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two U.S. presidential elections are however, however, at the tax and energy policy as well as in a landmark case.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in the economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a general, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubts in doubt and warns against the state of the economy, with taxes and regulation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton to death Clinton to death and to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">In other words, it would have quite different, claims, Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will retraced by massively, and he makes for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates strongly - for businesses and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton said: the state has certain tasks to open up and needs to open the disabled chances and needs to open money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, the taxes would increase for the maturation, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the one that, Trump and Clinton is almost identical.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidates in announces, the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State capital programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are rejected by the nationalist Tegel wings of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So, on Trump could give an additional internal start of discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Significant differences are significant in the energy and climate policy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump will build coal plants and drive the coal plants in the USA again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction should also be possible to cancel the Paris Climate protection agreement to all date of the Paris Climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton intends to expand its renewable energy program with their investment program. "a country will be able to create the Superrenewable energies, and millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want to say that we are. "</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even with international trade agreements, the two competitors are not far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transposfish trade agreements, do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the USA are not allowed to isolate the international trading, but simply to American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">Those should then be paid for better, about Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars was a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase them to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump can do in this question do is not clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be rye, then he says, he will not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the big discussion of the coming month is likely to develop, rather in order to develop the control policy of the two warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one side, Trump, which wants to rise to growth and citizens, to increase the growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics keep him with him, so that the budget deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other side, Clinton, who want to demand some taxes, and that it's more taxes, and their critics say, more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who flee the alone account, almost as everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house has been refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen, four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby, which is not one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">A little son in the arm laid down in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">With great eyes curious in the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother starred on the table top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until it noted that they will be observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">You are chased and remove the little ones at the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene is normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is a unit manager of Condrobs, a carrier for social aid offers in Bavaria, and is concerned with the subject of women on the flight.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of the north in one of the few decentralised accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs put together the establishment of a Pro Familia and the Munich Frauenhilfe institution in January.</seg>
<seg id="18">She officially opened her.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There is no - also known as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a qumann before the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who has seen here, has done on her escape with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">Because of wars, because they shall be persecuted, because they threatening torture or death, or because their families will send them as a hopes for their families to Europe. "</seg>
<seg id="24">In women, there were other reasons for the escape: "many places secretly secretly, because they do not see any other way."</seg>
<seg id="25">In her homeland, they have made experience of sexual violence, forced, honorary moral, slavery or forced constitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">They continue to continue.</seg>
<seg id="27">We continue to flee the further.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tug for instance, for instance, a bottle of water is no rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">And women are alone, they are not protected from their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believe that the end when they arrived in Germany, irre, tells Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here, all women in the refugee camps often were often considered as minderous and worse (even worse.)</seg>
<seg id="32">This leads to that about 90 percent of women who live in the house in the Munich north, traumatized them, estimates them.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are safe to have been voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so long that they say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't feel to talk about the earth, because the sham is big."</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they didn't have to help millions, require it more accommodation only for them, calls Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district ruled for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">At the question whether they have been using a similar project as in Munich in its statinability, reply some with Nein.</seg>
<seg id="39">Upper Franks not exist in the Upper Palatinate and Oberfranken approximately there is something of self-catering governments in the Upper Palatinate.</seg>
<seg id="40">The women are not separated in Schwaben alone, women are not separated from the government, "Karl-Heinz Meyer, press Officer of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower Saxony and Mittelfranken there are some common stories or their own houses just for the standing women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">Also the Committee "Rights of Women and equality of the sexes" in the European Parliament calls for women separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study that was published for the committee, it is: "it is very important that men and women can be separated from men."</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "the privacy or are accommodated together," it can catch up or catch-up violence against women. "</seg>
<seg id="46">Especially the shower room should be separated and accessible for women in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">As very the women of this shelter can be felt, you can get the Andrang that there is at the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">Since there has been about around that, we have a long waiting lists, "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="49">It might be slightly to make a second house.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a Geste that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday, to give hands the hands and an official end of the eight months in the words of the words of the words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin made his Turkish counterpart in the gold-gilded room of the St. Petersburg Palace in Reception, I cannot give me it to a counterpressure, Ankara, in most reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the hand stop, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But putins also took narrowly, narrowly, and beaded not heat, even for his return ratios.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, said repeatedly from his "love friend" Putin - according to a report, five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it. I couldn't count it.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said, he said that relations to Russia could not only return to Russia before the crisis, but even even further.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the next day a newspaper announced that the Erdogan had heard that, as would never have happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the end of enthusiasm, his enthusiasm rather seemed to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But a Putin of Putin under the chief of Russia showed that the State of Russia had not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in His words: the amortisation of a Russian Kampuluk from the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">In response to the time, Moscow was wutly.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin took up and accusing Ankara, Russia in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was even bigger, as it was said to have been committed by an official friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetosrough will be difficult to build even if it is not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has been converted to Russia since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once, it seemed that the Turks bear the debt for all the guilt.</seg>
<seg id="21">The serious worsening was serious by the official government officials that Erdogan's own family of illegal oil trade in Syria would have been adopted by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He was contested this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg, the official message that it was time to look back to the front.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally this meeting was only instead of instead because Putin received the President of the president, he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">In Russia, Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a truce is clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is on the first line of all friends that he can get, after it became a coup d'etat of his Amtes at a failed coup d'etat of his Amp.</seg>
<seg id="28">The terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there is also economic motifs.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions imposed Turkey some time - especially the ban of charter flights, which every year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and chartercompanies will be facilitated, when the flights will be taken again.</seg>
<seg id="33">You belong to the Mediterranean Sea with the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the country TV is inexpensive fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural could be imported again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti was formulated by the following words: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is focused on the West, since it was response to the conflict as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">For this purpose, the persistence of the EU accentuates the EU acceding negotiations and Putin - the disclosure of the EU acceding to reduce the trend and to reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian State leader in Ankara with security had a bonus that he demanded a coup d "état for the chosen state of State.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-evident for Moscow, which has a self-evident case, which even has a deepest fear of infringement.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace in the sea allowed Russia and Turkey, one like it described me an analyst: "the alliance of outside cantons,": two countries, which treats from the west and badly joined by the west.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two even large differences.</seg>
<seg id="43">The largest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacekeeping, but where Russia and Turkey have already support more.</seg>
<seg id="44">It may be that, after almost three hours, both President would have agreed upon the press conference on the press conference that they had not even undered the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey said to reply to a question about their differential to reply, while Putin decided to emphasize this one.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus that may be found in front of a joint Nenner in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of fine pruning - and in view of the potential for a perfect Disaster, as the NATO member of Turkey became the Russian fighting jet - it certainly better to talk the two Heads of State at least one another.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia, Russian Putin and Chief of Defence Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">The Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed an unexpected by his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was many years of the engest confidence in Putin of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old has been appointed special responsibility for Environmental and Transport Industry.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an opinion from the Kremlin's opinion it is that Putin is said to have ordered this duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential administration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been the deputy chairman since 2012 was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in Tallinn in 1972, he made his conclusion at the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin means (in Russian), it is that he later was chief of protocol and chief of the control technology.</seg>
<seg id="10">Over his appointment, he said to Putin: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think that it is the most important task of the government to assist your activity as head of state-out and controls on the implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin performed the Russian TV channel on Friday with Ivanov to leave his position and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">See the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step is made in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was long time of one of the closest confidentists, Vladimir Putin and works as he worked for Soviet Intelligence, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">On a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, the two men had claimed his request at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the round of the cameras, only few of them were convinced - especially before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Here is the result of a kind of power uptake?</seg>
<seg id="20">The white no one has no one.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official allegation - that a man who once constituted them as a potential president to conduct the Russian environmental policy - came to a large scepticism once again.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, that is quoted on the website of the Kremlin said that Ivanov said it is true that I could say this very complicated - one could almost say - this could be reached for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it out, I am out for four years and eight months of Chairman of the Russian Presidential administration.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took part in the post of December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian security Council and such as Putin's former member of the state security service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, as Putin Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), was appointed to the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin made his power in Ivanov, Ivanov called Ivanov as one of five people, of whom he was confidential.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov could happen to the second term President of Russia, as a third term of coup could bear against the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close to the allies, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister, before returning to the President in three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="1">You want to improve the good apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and Grüne my: investors have to be raised much stronger in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">As responds to the bad message, Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 favorable apartments in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes to the next round out meeting a "action concept."</seg>
<seg id="5">But the fight.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the first line it goes to the question: who is to build a favourable price for a favourable price?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Christoph vimann writes: "we have said," We are able to build the Greens: who wants to build up to urban areas, there must be 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing. "</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the affordable apartments are also created in the stock.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the big point of the town hall was, however, as violmann: "how goes to investors to build a private space on private areas?"</seg>
<seg id="11">We want to make investors on such areas at least 10 percent, but as possible to build 20 percent of the apartments as a social housing. "</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing programme, which will cost CHF millions, will be financed and will be financed at Anreize.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, as violmann: "there is currently no agreement between the fractions."</seg>
<seg id="14">However, CDU wants to make investors as a few rules.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Linke is still subject to investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of the situation, bromann, bahne is an disappearance of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept is implemented, the concept will provide additional tasks in the building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the expert forces.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yet, the program does not include: because the around 1260 new apartments should be built.</seg>
<seg id="21">Like this, however, the loss of some 1300 inexpensive apartments come from, whose promotion will run in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 there will be 500 apartments by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, the planation of the Nicole Palm, the planation of the city will now be bought out of the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, the apartments should also be thought to pick up the apartments again in the price connection.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the Weststadt town.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem, solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the West city, as at the end of the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be returned to the price connection for favorable apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: that's the owners, the housing companies not only.</seg>
<seg id="30">For example, the number of social rooms in the Weststadt again increase drastically, removed from the target of the so-called mixture.</seg>
<seg id="31">A concentration of social weak in just a few city gates should not give it more.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Green Green proposed that there will be a movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Spokesperson Holger Herlitschke said: "for a broad majority, the CDU board must have to do with the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">In fact, there are concentrated on more construction sites for family homes.</seg>
<seg id="35">However, what does not name that not yet a compromise can be found.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, which is worth worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="2">It's fascinating to tell how the world changed.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the past decade, teenager and child needs to go out again, but it was rather good to spend their free time to spend their leisure time, on screens up to rigid, was accused of having participated in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">With Pokemon Go it's therefore to get people from the sofa and let it become active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially restricted to the TV, then on video games and most recently to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it's great to see that technology and activities are not close to each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm out of course, of course, on the Pokémon Go-Wahn that were based on the characteristics, which were initially created for video games in the 1990s (later, an animated series, game maps and other spin-off) were created.</seg>
<seg id="8">As many phenomena of Popular culture sank out, before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within less days, Pokémon Go is more user than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short time the players left with their smart phones and search for Pokémons, who have been pursued with a GPS and once they were found once they were photographed. "(via a screenshot of the mobile phone) or caught up."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game, when she was younger, joined the Wahn and finished in the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the USA led the game to a considerable increase in steps which puts the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardially, an app for Apple Watch, who recently purchased Washington Post in Washington, agreed that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of reconcise people who wish to train every day 30 minutes to 53 per cent of the game.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only looks the raw data for performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public relations campaigns to health, the people want to take away "30 minutes of time," by the sofa, "and" every day is actively involved in the ears, because many public messages are coming to health boring and come from people who come to people. "</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of Sport cannot be assessed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly contain sport drives, reduce his chances, to cancer, or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical control helps with the weights control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages which may lead to it here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful on Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do anything in the open that they make fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Therefore three columns of the health cover - movement, fresh air and sunshine and fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people join the hunt for new friendship.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also müral playerber, which have to be connected to something like a bit.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should? s?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit already tested our activity, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new era will lose his maturity and the use will be covered with the time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to poker success, it will be more games to unite the apps and virtual reality with the active world will be combined in the real world and will help many people on the hunt, active, fitter and sweep.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we're Simone, Gabby and Laurie.</seg>
<seg id="2">That's what I am under the women's member in the tower, and that is composed of more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I am since 1984 at any summer Olympiad and the USA were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly, this team has three Turnered, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren, Laurie's "Hernandez, who had the many young girls of other skin art.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew is and Madison Kocian, the Cathocian, round off every proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team reflects the USA against the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has the black and hispanic female presence at the forefront of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one was one of the female turf an Afro-Americans.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympiad and the Americas.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now, the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as it unexpected, but most of the best-lasting Gymastikroutines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone the fourth, heterisation of American, who won a race event for women Gold in an individual multi-events event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Clubteam member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the tip of this kind, but you can see turnaround in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie came to create all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympiamend is only four Turnered in the team. moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainers.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is so that Turns will be more expensive sport and Turner to the first line to combine their parents, competition, travel garment, competition, and hotel costs (for the coach and their Turner and families). the list can be removed from any time.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these Gym is in a wealthy suburbs that support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In this course, Turner you get a complete training and that is a lot of life and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both her athlete, since they started with the Turns.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired by the communities of many, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, have been inspired by a fully equipped and easier access.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gyro-Foundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have free and affordable Turns in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (especially black and hispanes), and international and international competitions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expanding Detroit (my home town) to Detroit (my home town) to provide the youth high-quality tower to learn the chance to learn from this great Olympic sports art.</seg>
<seg id="26">Tower developed strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and destination for the spirit.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long advantages for health and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the tower and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in the Sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is an interesting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holes of Olympic champion, and thank you so many young girls can be motivated to start their way to start sound, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British travel undergoing his immune system and sausage of a serious test - by creating some of the tastes and ectiest places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel agency Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, on a Euro-shot, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a dishwaher of a tensile toilette and a public telephone in Russia to provide the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the ablings of any object, it used a Luminometer to show and show us what it will be.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results in daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea, the dishwaher of a tensile toilette which was already used by thousands of other, may be completely abrupt, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright with doctors and medical specialists spoke about the promotion of Darmbately, as well as his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily, nothing left what he raised, more than a bad disgrabs in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known for this, the resistance of his Darms, traveled by the world, and ate-like, as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money back to washing stations up to dishcrisp of toilets, the task showed his immune system definitely below one sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the movie he told: "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned, what my health affects my health, and I have my possible things to my mouth, earth, sausage and smilking."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to meet his call for each case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The tiny public toilet in Russia was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His probezel revealed a Luminometric number of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the Luminometerisation amounts to fresh hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to break after their Luminometric number over 4000 units, while freshly absorbed hands one from less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products produced the Reisefilm "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," who shows the bacterienzahl at various locations such as the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film, he says: "this comes to the worst what I have in a toilet, close to"</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt road than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'll have nothing to hide here because there is drunk here.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company stains Mr. Wright with validation gradient from both lactobacillus and vitamin C and D, in order to support the promotion of Darmbh and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Validation: Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to have something new something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that fascinating to look at the same time, at the same time the benefits of Probiotic is explained.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led a crazy Brainstormings, so that we said, "we said to call" Lass. "</seg>
<seg id="26">She claim that the interest in intestinal health is to become a global phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of only about the products we wanted to talk to a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our allday environment, the importance of intestinal health and the immune system is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary, we could provide more information on an interesting way in consumers.</seg>
<seg id="29">I think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the film of the film, added: "let me say that I would have lost my respect for Ian, when he got out of things, I have made it for him, as the ekeldest Russian toilet which will be shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things that easier was easier to bring Ian to bring them to them, and others, in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad that we have recorded some of these dirty scenes on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a validation survey carried out by the year 2015, 84 percent of those questioned lactic acid bacteria, especially with the wellbeing of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally products which included lactobacillus lactobacillus.</seg>

<seg id="12">The SPD, the most powerful party since 1998, is now clear behind the CDU band.</seg>
<seg id="13">This will be exciting as strong newcomer Afro, and what remains at the end of Koalitiones remains.</seg>

<seg id="8">The conflict will also be praised to the work of the construction works, when it goes to the facility of heating.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the building site on Monday to the south, the lock of the Aspergstraße in Ofandingen has been lifted and thus the link to Rottenburg has again been removed again, the transport system has been relaxed within the place.</seg>

<seg id="35">If I would have had a company with 4000 employees, and half would have been released, the policy would be different.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, the President Jörg Schmidt developed an inquiry on request by GÖHNER, whether it's a financial support, which gives you a financial contribution from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now, they must also apply the disadvantages which result through the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="37">GÖHNER knows from other counties, where some generous was handled.</seg>

<seg id="2">The men of middle ages love with boards.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you take part in the commanding position in order to overhang him under the pseudonym "non-Alleinsamenames, which led to a result of current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the most promising Remaking of sound plates have not want to greet to a boom in Millennium than that are due to new understanding of physical objects, but on Midlife-Nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record, all predictions are between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">Indeed, the age group 18-24 is the most likely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also no hordes through the planerysammers - it has an emotional meaning: older turnouts keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV would I follow the camera, while in the midst of a busy road in Soho, I would stay in a busy road, my hands do not burn, my hands and something like: "so let us take us an immediate view."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's leave a look at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of SoHos is slowly set up in its charm - Hotels, restaurants and offices as well as the building in which once independent seller were located - there are a handful of fantastic turntables.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera to switch to the camera for the next part, in which I am standing in close proximity to various men in such shops and tests, her age and vegetables through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart, Glasgow, 55, whom I was up from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men of middle ages), a wife, probably around the 20), is one day because of a meeting in London and continues through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "already," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4,000 sheets.</seg>
<seg id="17">This sound plates, shown above (he sent me the snail by e-mail, I am not sent home, followed by me), then shine the walls of its living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has a such sizable number of albums, and Singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy it in the location, which he sold it, as he sold and plead again to buy, when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things that I buy now, are published in the late 60ies, early 70ies, which was released, when I was 11 or 12. things, when I thought to buy something for me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">It is true that those who want to sell records, would like to spend time, and add it alone: "I smoke not and I don't have much too much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers who meets at the YouGov-profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new shaft to people, who have influenced by the Medipe, people who have heard over the comeback, and let's see their ancient records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the discussions that I have led people in the rule as around 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their CDs, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to tags of the turntables on a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what is with the alleged emotional importance?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds into a shop like Phonica, to recognize that record shops offers a based community of equality.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older customers include contact with the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans have been overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw the stability of familiar noise levels, from counterparts, the happy Jugenderings.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the feeding of a lease or property of material owners as a kind of Trost," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as collectors and I think it is so that it is with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to employ mentally challenging.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" flute is a staff of one record-stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of the people who have bought a record, they did not have one record.</seg>
<seg id="36">The poll found out that 41% have a turntables, which they never use, while 7% of those who have a plate, no turntables have no turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time the news report would probably look very worried, while I go through a stack of Bossa Nova combations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (data number: three men of middle ages), has a "trophipect" of the Revival. "</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came recently here, and said," I have no turntables, but I would like to buy a Radiohead power top, so I can play it into the shelf. "</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a great percentage, but it happens definitely.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive-consuming, less musictig.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older who come only slowly.</seg>

<seg id="45">There are couples about 70, tourists, photos make photos, teenagers and women middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the pre-standing business - Wild Beyond is the newest synthesizer and sextet Pop instead of experimental jazz band from the speaker, it's good to see a diversity of diversity in the customers.</seg>

<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or to other way, but the beauty of plates is "... they drives with a cooked Seufzer.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how I ought to declare it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop, from which it is said that a new generation of turntables have inspired to have inspired, "Urban Outder.</seg>

<seg id="57">No one sees them to - maybe because they are only decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to get it.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "Plattenkunst". "</seg>
<seg id="59">However, however, considering that any attraction for these objects will represent more money for the industry, and some customers could send in the depths of SoHos for more send.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, the one that is most of luxury items such as sheets.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at 7-year-old Rugby came in the final on Thursday evening to a abrupt hand at the last hurdle at the Fijis, when they were handled with a result of 43-7 in Deodorus stage.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji divided a master class at the handling, side-stepping, descending, lines and rosive strength to win gold - their first Olympiameers of every color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was due to the very well bad dry weight of silver medal for the Great Britain - and they could be very proud to their efforts in this tournament that they came to New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinct defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could be withdrawn in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of the Fiji, there are a 15-man team in best form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a Trost for GB, but it is likely not - that at least one Brite tomorrow will depend on a gold medal by his neck: fijis chef trainer Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult road behind it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ago, she lost eight years ago, Ryan every play at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>

<seg id="14">With four minutes of the season, Jerry Tuwai was still an attack of the right corner from the right corner.</seg>

<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua is in the right corner for a touch down and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa has added a new name since the playlist and there were still more than one minute of the season... in the first half of the season.</seg>
<seg id="19">Valo Ravouvou preaching further fading of the GB teams and stormed to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 until break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is so that Fiji was born to play 7, while GB are still rising.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is also possible.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB resulted in fundamental changes to half-time and finished the fijia gap - for all four minutes, which was good for the circumstances of the first half time, until Joshua Tuisova, after a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt to GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has been running in favour of the South Osseans, whose fans sangen, faders and danced to the triway.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playerapproach of Fijis.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no embosses gold as with these games and what is what is hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rowing up to the last, 220 hard Hieve which go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in its goldenem moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though it was only the task of the family, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainers Robin Williams, was present at the two positions in a row without tax concubles in a consequence, the first women in the history of the British sport that made such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their Dominance was absolutely, after all, its 39.ter was installed, which is also exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athos, that reflects the surface of the elegance with the elegance, which is reflected not the type of Triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each Gold in the ruin, a Bataillon is to carry out the difference and there was no other things that no one was no surprise than the coach, who would not survive this day in the day, when he was diagnosed with him cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he is what riskant.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder the bladder cancer that can be operated and did they think.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do this, it is not to do so anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty chlimme situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changed a little view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had fortunate good luck to start out the treatment in early 2014, outside the season, which could be held on a minimum, if that is the right term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go to me even better.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet on a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="18">So it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The ruin itself is already a challenge, but this makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the middle of the victory of the victory went their first thoughts on Williams, who went up a nervenous morning so somewhat more than usual, he was trying to process his own freeroll.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, which was as a commander in the Royal Artistry regiment in Afghanistan, "I was this week an emotional wreck. this is perhaps somewhat extremely tough, but it means much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is repeated how much mine that means how much I and Helen, and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would have no one, therefore goes a massive Danke. he is the best trainer of the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would not have any better person for trainers or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm, with which their opponent could not go up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark had to close the teams, Stanning and Glover had much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "lead in a process, lead in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to leave itself.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not pleased about to make a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted to see a fireworks today, we wanted to achieve a good result, continue and win the race, which we did so.</seg>
<seg id="34">The pair will take place for a year time before making decisions about the future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV-adventurer Steve brick.</seg>

<seg id="7">Most seniors in chorus, and divide the joy to music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">The regular consultations may be called social contacts and maintain them.</seg>
<seg id="9">For often, social and family structures at the age, an chorus is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in its choir: "willing to discuss and organize on the other hand, and to learn one another form - a choir of the mersone."</seg>
<seg id="11">Sing can sing in the positive sense, hacker believes, Hackler.</seg>

<seg id="13">Who knows his Lunge regularly calls for everyday life in everyday life not as fast as quickly.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it goes to get the sound of voice at the age, Singen is an optimistic hobby.</seg>

<seg id="16">In the older generations, the joint Singen had a lot of higher importance, it belonged to everyday life in the school as well as in the leisure time.</seg>

<seg id="18">By interpretation and especially melody's failed people themselves demendousous people in long-legged events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, the head will also requires a special performance at the head.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, they focus on their own voice and to focus on a specified rhythm and to match the other singers - that is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people who live alone, are not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that you are marked by the Singen choir, Hackler believes.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic public is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem was also growing at the choir through the Singen choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">Itself, even to show: if I have a little bit for something, I'll be better and wse over me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with the Singen, there is enough enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Who wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate to do not hesitate to have little talent.</seg>
<seg id="28">One sings is not alone - at 50 sinthe people who learnt to go there, even if a sound does it?</seg>
<seg id="29">On the search for the appropriate offer, the seniors have different ways, "Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="30">If any man is singing in a full-enchyor, you can easily connect to your friend.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities offer plenty of views over the choirs of the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="32">Who like to sing in a church choir, can directly turn right to the church or the church.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior officials will be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the Internet, may ask the family, friends or neighbours around the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="35">He who want to sing to sing, should definitely be a choir, and hackers.</seg>

<seg id="1">The right "Identitular movement" is on the visions of the Federal Constitutional Treaty.</seg>
<seg id="2">After several towns, the Constitutional Court also made the Constitutional Court under observation.</seg>
<seg id="3">We will see the 'Identitary movement "Annopoints for efforts against freedom of democratic constitution," said the director Hans-Georg Maate of the German press agency in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thus, Zuwanderer forms, or from the Middle East in exceptional manner, diffuse.</seg>
<seg id="5">Therefore we can now watch the movement now.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "Identitular movement" is a group of French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="7">They spends against "Multiki-Wahn," an uncontrolled mass tracedures "and" loss of your own identity. "</seg>
<seg id="8">Constitutional Court in nine states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Saxony, Saxony, and Thuringia - observe the "Identitary" already.</seg>
<seg id="9">Maate said his authority has been closely matched together with the governments.</seg>
<seg id="10">"groups like the 'Identitular movement" try to pick up their target group, where it stands, "said the Constitutional Court.</seg>
<seg id="11">In general, extremists try to address them with adolescter language, often with poppy music.</seg>
<seg id="12">The daily cumists as well as right-sexes.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is not a bed advertising for their own thing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The propaganda should be emotional.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are due in special way.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">Most recently, from several federal states reports about contacts of the "Identitary" was given to Afro-political leaders.</seg>
<seg id="18">Maate said, I don't have any insights.</seg>
<seg id="19">It may be relevant to the constitutional protection, possible contacts this species only be relevant from a certain point.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is aware of whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - characterized by certain persons, which is exceptional, its target device changes and an extreme efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is the decisive factor if such people have a influence on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not visible.</seg>
<seg id="23">With a view to the clear increase of rights motivated by disappointments and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees, Maate, he would not talk about new rights terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="24">But we have found it in recent years that there may be a justification of the structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There were the group 'Old School Society' or the Friday group.</seg>
<seg id="26">It may be possible that further evidence-like groupings or small groups form, the attack against asylum seekers, against refugee and Attachers from other right-to-right modes.</seg>
<seg id="27">A Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of rectsterrorism is not visible.</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were created on the regional level or social network.</seg>
<seg id="29">There were no worried about Maate that many overgrips went to the account of people who did not occur in his right scene.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the besorginal cord.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many of the crime in Attachers at Attacken on asylum are not regarded as criminals, politically leftme or supporters of the right scene.</seg>
<seg id="32">So many people have committed themselves, who had not having right on the hat, which were perhaps politically undifferent or for example, in the CDU, SPD or Linke, but have however, however, due to justification.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen the trampolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Where are always, as late it is, there are the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel and unobtruce, a shave relay between competition and streches.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, as if the Olympic fackel would be a burning of flammable rod, which protect against floats to Turner for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not read the TV set, a newspaper, or when conversation on your neighbors in the waiting-hop, without over Simone Biles, Katie Leisy or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad to hear.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympics games and a women with regards dimples, would have been broadcasted under this known name which can be sent to the Prime Time, provided by sponsors and clean TV advertising if it would be a floats, Turner or even Freal.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the Olympics in the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame lit not every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the town, partly in the shade are sports, which are not generally accepted: aerial view, archery, Badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swim and let it say goodbye to the chest.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I want to make modest arguments for my specific Liebling, then let me know the attention to the discreetable charm of the trampolins.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline had already been a Olympic event since 2000, when it had been real time since 2000, the last 16 years so many that I had been interviewed, did not know that there is a Olympiasportart at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">The could also be regional Ignorms.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the US athletes sent to competition, it has never won a Medal in the trampoline for up to 2012 who had had a athletes until 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and Russians are happy to divide the prices for men and the Chinese and the Canadians to divide the women for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend this year's gold medal in London.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jump has some certain outside-iterate, partly because it sounds for the unlocked ear-matching ear for a clownsSchool as the site for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I don't want to be an expert but only a few hours of enthusiasts.</seg>
<seg id="20">It's humorous potential - the cartoonist of its never to swollen sieve - but also the grazie of the turntables and diving that are mainly combines.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means that many means "dive board."</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winner on a huge trampoline, first jumped up to 30 feet in the air and must have a number of attacking movements (turning, hreal and saltos) before reaching back to the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">You will be evaluated according to the official Olympic section series according to execution, difficulty and "Flugtime."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medaillenhoping must continue to go with gold, faster, after above and drongo, sometimes until the target, sometimes and back, after the top and down the playground on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">Do not only appear to the finish line or the output wall, but in the television transmission, the world of the world or the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted streak is novers, admired nsvalue, even fanatic and it's enough to stir even an audience in tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I want to look at this games as a little dazzlingly.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing space.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline sprint is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A preliminary movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or her prt, seemingly heavist like a astronomer, goes down to the top, then easily back to the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, not wölben into the distance, only the dream, elegant repeal of time and heavy force.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games only.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifiers and final hours of women will be staged on Friday afternoon, in Streaming by 13.00 Eastern Time; the men of the men on Saturday, also around 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC is displayed as part of a follow-up block of two days from 14.00 to 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia Manie, they promise a quiet, nice moment, which will probably be shown in the general tumours.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the awareness of consciousness can only be reached by the anxiety and the objective of male athletes - as it confirmed the male US-Turner according to the The Wall Street Journal recently sent to the air of Dooley the new fan community.</seg>

<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just break it?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid cosiders of West Africa with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months, protests against the government passed the country and far more territories within the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people on the streets and desired fundamental changes of fundamental changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response to the government was unstoppable according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witness to that policemen on zig for seventy protesters were killed and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, the videos above the protests, which are probably hit by the last or beginning of this year, show young people with shocks, while these were forced to make a roll against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN High Authority on human rights requires a further investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">It was always difficult to keep this country, and in the future it will even be more difficult, "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most influential country of Africa and its stability is estimated at the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely together with the Ethiopia, in order to tackle the region against the region, in particular against the region, in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, so much western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy is expanding into impressive pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new pendancy in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even when Ethiopia was given all other as a model for democracy, human rights organizations have constantly led the repression, by the opposition - the opposition in the country was limited to be effective for the silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, or killed or into the uncertainties of the wilderness.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you press people and these do not have any other options, except, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopians. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth is protacted.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation of protector.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from ground use up to the worshippers in terms of power of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a far-reaching election in the year, the Party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and control over 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the stresses along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this zacking, remuneration line demanded in June hundreds of life.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fear separatists such as Oromo-liberate Front, or the National Liberation front of the Ogaden, which have been enforced during the past years and could be armed by turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings from the biting after years ago, Hinköchelns explode with the surface now.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in the last few years, many Ethiopian was able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones were more often more common, and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government considers the access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially in test, many people can still communicate with Internet Proxies, the sbergen, where they hold up.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopian announced that they met in Protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic origin in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are no natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since the prospering of the amharma, the Amharma, which come from Etthopiens, come mainly between the politics and economy, while they are the Oromos, of which many Muslims are live and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that changes the changes too.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are doing, under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests in the areas of Amhara and Oromos took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and in the military, in the intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former Rebelleader, was until his death on a non-ordinated illness in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as takirgenius, a man who was able to think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that it was particularly reversible in it, early signs of dissatisfaction and special enforced to work with opponents and to make sure opponents.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is missing on this elementary" skill, "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected from relatively uninterrupted reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of the northern Ethiopiens, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he did not enjoy the confidence of the Tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many beaming to fear that the result is more blood.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time in Ethiopia, in 2005, following thousands of the elections, in 2005, after thousands of the elections, according to analytics, according to analytics, according to the government, had been stolen and then were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">While the following raids were killed many proteins, even if there were less than in the last months and this time the unrest was relatively fast.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts of Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure development, such as the new Pendancy, as well as for their measuring progress in the poverty line.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this is not the intensification of the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month of ferries in gondar, a amharan town, of Tigray, shops and hatred, as opposed to the Tigray will be more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the US and other western associations were used in a one-like position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronement flights across the neighbouring Somalia, even if they were recently closed, they closed this basis.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West is clear to support democracy, he will not want to perform that his allies is breaks in a more volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="3">As a fine, President Roosevelt was a Faible for sophisticated Delicacies of land, such as Pâte de Foie gras and Maryland water signs.</seg>
<seg id="4">His meal on this day was something modest: filled eggs in Tomatensauce, potato püree, and the dessert a pupil puzzy.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "it was an act of culinary solidarity with wear people," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "There was also an message of the Americans, as they should eat."</seg>

<seg id="8">The book "Chop Suey" was "" "Chop Suey" from Chinese Kitchen, while Zidman in its book "97 Orchard" tells about life in a residence at the Lower East Side of the food.</seg>
<seg id="9">Your latest collaboration, "An active meal," which will appear on Tuesday in Harper Verlag, illustrated the history of American kitchen during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a small, quick dry Imbiss in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the IPO in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brick, 54, ordered a fresh kesandwich with olive tree, while Coe, 57, Truthahn with potato püree and mixtures.</seg>

<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household mainly in rural areas, an all-You Can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Crews of women kochten for male rock workers and it was served as a freshly pastures for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">The American, Americans sent men during the first World War. "A Square Meal," out of which the country went into, with which the country did not stop more the Schlaraffenland.</seg>
<seg id="22">It was a time, in the food for the American, a central theme, "says Coe, why he and his wife had to write his wife."</seg>
<seg id="23">The new Budgeting: the new Budgetary diet: the mysterious food as a wonderful kind of food as "wonderful kind, food remains replenished," merging brick on, as Köche unexpectedly could hide himself under a creative sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by inexpensive drycloobst.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the core of the American kitchen, was a rare in the fourth luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">A self-like blended mixer were tried-filled, since a calorie rich and wet specimen was jumped in front of taste or even healthy kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="27">During her research for the book, which was also recipes includes, set a court from this epoch, gebackene onions with peanut butter.</seg>

<seg id="33">By making the recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to play "Household Chemicals" and the challenge, Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots in delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"A Square Meal" is a festival of historical experience.</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports about the response to the aid of the government to the aid of citizens, like President Herbert Hoovers Lass-me-food-attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he was public the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen with his kitchen, spste, like the million severe man from the world, which he became.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he breeered kitchen such as fish with Gurkensauce," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="38">It ate in a almost gold-plated dining room and also contributed to.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was a realistic-horse.</seg>
<seg id="40">Perhaps the same mistakes, when not the same mistakes, when not his wife Eleanor asked him to join him with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the present day described by a housekeeper with no interest in flavours by Mrs. Roosevelt, that the White House brought the boring of food in Washington, but also one of the most difficult meals. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression, filled with food, once the country came back on the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The retaliable is based on our continuing focus on calories and food, the level man, as well as science on food was applied.</seg>
<seg id="44">The pair gave in writing to the writing of the book the essence of Zidman's mother-mother-grandmother, - for example, how they could not take away food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "she had a true fear of the disappearance of food," said Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="46">Brick man reminded: "she made people really sick."</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the wind power by wind power.</seg>
<seg id="48">After the plate of Eisenberg's dish were absent, they moved away and Coe a dessert that they had taken away from home: the plunderstands, the President Roosevelt at lunch.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is called Prune Whip, "said Zidman and added to that there was a common trick, humble recipes to miss a send name."</seg>
<seg id="50">There were no lubricating cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>
<seg id="51">Each thrice a bit contradicted a spoon into the tough, brown Glibber.</seg>
<seg id="52">Astonishness it was not bad.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrates is almost 400 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2">More rarely look at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-haie usually come to the surface only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">After an investigation on board the research project Sanna back to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and is difficult at a distance of 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - till today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland only got up with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the bottom of the north-Atlantic coast, Greenland on the ground of the North Atlantic Sea in an hour he arrives on an average of 1,220 metres.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only if it is drone, the five meters long animal accelerates to satte 2.6 km / h - and it has a top speed of just as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This kind of lonelly lifestyle seems to be a sponsorship for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues took part in the journal Science "in any case by a Greenland hai, who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Wahnste," commented on Alexander Schralein by Max Planck Institute for demographic Research in Rostock this lifespan well, which means for vertebrates a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">In fact, the Evolutionsbiologist already had long that Greenland are stone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only a lack of evidence is proof.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grönland haie are difficult to observe, finally, in particular, they live in the coast of the coast of Canada, Greenland, Greenland, Norway and top.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water-temperatures of the six degrees Celsius, they dive at the surface usually only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">So far more about the lifestyle of Greenland-hay researchers according to the lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her schedule can be adjusted for her time, when they took six animals in front of the peaks of six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loie still make this position: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had made the knobs of a young iron ore.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly she may take a sleeper animals or patrol on the ground of the Eismeeres and search Kadaver that are from higher water layers to bottom torangles.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland-hay, the fisherman between 2010 and 2013, to Grönland or Svalbard for the beginning of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest of Hai was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 increases.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of animals, they analyzed the lens with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This center of ophthalmologists is already formed before the birth of the Haie, which contained the proteins are not renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 had a lot of carbon-14 in the liner.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s as a nuclear tests, larger quantities of the radioactive carbon in the atmosphere of the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the with 220 centimeters, the third smallest of the smallest animal in the liner, on the other hand, with a low transverse to carbon-14, are expected to have celebrated its 50th birthday at his study in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All of the larger Greenland sweeping forces in their liner shape the normal carbon-14 amounts, which creates by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 is actually demonstrated at an age of 493 centimeters in Greenland for an age of 335 years, while the record Hai was going to be 392 years old even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönmhai-females only gets up, when they are longer than four meters, known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could be assigned an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably died at the threshold of sexually mature and his age with 156 years, Greenland-hay has been determined at least one and a half centuries ago.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even that is currently the world record for vertebrates are currently world record.</seg>
<seg id="33">Such that such methusaleme live primarily in eater waters, is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211-year old Greenland, in its speck at Nacken, a 120-year-old hardhallmark was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Through the low temperatures, the organism is often found on fire retardant there.</seg>
<seg id="36">So, then, and alakening slow.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals will also often keep very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface, due to the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than at a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">One another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">If a smaller animal lives, so many descendants live, preferably as many descendants, "explains the evolutionbiologist Schultlein."</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal was to invest its resources rather in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland, Callum Skinternal raest last evening in the male team-Sprint in Velodrom in Rio is going to fame, when the British Team took the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor of a man who made his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy. he made a legend, and made a legend, when he overthrew his home to a victory of the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Four years ago, England was stressed a shocked victory, while Hoy took the fifth of the six Olympiagolders.</seg>
<seg id="5">She repeated the trick, after taking place at the World Championship in London in March, despite the return flight Hoys just a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the cyclers Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did in time as an execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys's retirement, a gap, the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinternal was the man in which they stayed, when they saw the potential in the shots, which now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - who won four years ago with Hoy victorious and Skinternal in the qualifications round a Olympiarekord, but in the top row the New Zealand was victorious in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder was barely back after his round, but Kenny brought the team to the front and Skinternal.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategy change also made a major part of the transformation in which the execution in a higher gear used to allow him to slow down and keep pace, and especially Skinternal to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy saw from his position as a BBC expert, and was Skinternal, Kenny and Hindes, when they were on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinternal from Glasgow said: "it is a shattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I have only been here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have set up a Olympiarekord in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was simple.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012, Hoys, and Hoys gave himself to that he dropped to a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He moved this statement later, and there was no objecting of England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such a winning victory there was no problem this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hinder said, "it's feels like to play with all the GB flags on the triway like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">In the last three months, we have joined the team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We are so bad at such a lot of world score that it was incredibly, once again at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event to be a gold medal for the nation that were seven out of 10 titles in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If the bar ometer of our progress in the last five months is that we expect a successful five days in the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of the possibility it is in the area of the possibility that he repeated Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">This would be the position for Kenny - the exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on 23 March, was also born on the day of British sports; Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - an yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">The cheese is equal to Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the Sprint part, which begins today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I have engineering into this only for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team Event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels something to win alone alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hinder said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only Medaillons competition of the day, but there was another good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull are qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They came to 3: 51,942 at the destination.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, who won gold in London in 2012, was 3: 51.659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be taking place on the second day of the competition, at the Wiggins with security in focus.</seg>
<seg id="42">In spite of the representative of the qualifier, he had taken the function as a function to measure his body-size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the respective women's competition, the future being continued and finished, with a little Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team will leave his powerful railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and take a scar to medals.</seg>

<seg id="8">The Planet proved probably more dry areas than the earth, but had once enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and shine before the evaporisation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent matter.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: such perfide erpressing hacker will benefit your Lösemoney</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmer of Eritungs-Malware is currently specifically targeted and are successfully implemented.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a current survey conducted by the malware Anti-Year Specialists in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 per cent of surveyed companies have been at least once, partly several victims of a Attachment with Erpresser software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, nearly 20 per cent of companies were already taken part of a Ransomware replacement.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of victims paid by the perpetrators required by the perpetrators to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators are visualize their Erpresser software according to the observations of Malchiabytes and Attachin company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are successful there, the potential to be significantly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">We will see a terrifying evolution of the pollutants. "we are explained that Malchytes-chef Marcin Kleczynski explains in conversation with the" World. "</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then discovered the perpetrators software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only were private useful purpose, but the change to the company took place in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, you are searching for a long changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files as well as to archives from images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the Ransomware and erases the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the requirements of the Erpresser.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final turnkey code to the files, the victims of money - mostly in the form of Crypassing bitcoin - have to be overseen.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where in private users the personal Photo database is based on the game, it is concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the damage, if a Ransomware is needed.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses by Ransomware, 13 percent had to break the business activities in a risk of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals were already threatened by many hospitals, whose patients can be threatened by the loss of nurse.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the victims always: pays tribute to, you only promotes the problem," explains Kleczynsky.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies who are to pay their data.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to set the demand of the perpetrators in view of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know the hackers again and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a current study conducted by F-Secure, the payload areas and contact with compressors and come on contact with the results: the perpetrators try to build a kind of customer service to increase more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You declare to reduce their victims by chat as they can pay via Bitcoin, free to access support websites, or decrypt free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people went to payments of a few hundred euros, must share some hard negotiate and five digit sums up to date their data.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potential high and relatively risk-risk profits from the Ransomware compressors, the work of the Chester Wisniewski contributed by the antivirus market SOPHOS: "a single person can write a Ransomware approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is however probable that it is about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmer sell their damage software in the form of a software building on the actual relief.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware-Kits were created by which the malware infection has also purchased, advice and additional tools for one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">Included is an adjustment tool that can be changed, so smaller configurations, appearance, and branding can be changed, "says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Erpresser are looking for further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in an service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">It takes you to install in one of the suben in the underground, buys the set of a detective and tasked to install the software on many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per infected machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the detective and then spoke of the dissemination with the dissemination," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies who want to secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 per cent of companies-IT companies are able to trust in the Malo-survey survey on Ransomware using file back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">According to the perpetrators already follow new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is no sufficient threat for successful reessments, threatens the perpetrators instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains Malchytes-chef Marcin Kleczynsky.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thus, the damage potential is higher than before, according to the type of data still than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">Also, the perpetrators could have completely new goals in the internet of things on the body.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the Hackney's Conference, the safety researchers demonstrated how they could receive a thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of a so-called heating could be a managevictim to be money.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then work instead of the heating in the future offers all production road in a factory block, Ransomware could also be an issue in the Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="3">In the small HR-V, Honda will unpack it all: a little SUV, a little bit and even the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds pretty good, yet the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, has actually been extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the HR-V has a small HR-V rather small, the passengers have much space both in the first row as well as in the rear, it acts close to none.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the inside space are well processed and are pleasantly, only the cockpit top is because there is something.</seg>
<seg id="7">Versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR-V in the storage room.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not only a trunk diameter of 453 l at highly made and 1026 l with converted back rests, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magic, as it sounds: the seat area of the back bank can be folded and therefore offer storage space, which is high from the bottom to the ceilings 1,24 m high.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk area is well-loaded, however the load height with 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he should be somewhat quieter for his work.</seg>

<seg id="15">All four-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The chassis is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, the steering is likely to be direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment is not open to the tested top model "Executive" in the tested top version.</seg>
<seg id="19">The safety systems belongs to the city emergency braking system (works up to 32), the collision system and trace heating system.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collecwarns is sometimes, because it's rated many obstacles than "herannelling objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">Very reliably works the remote light assistant.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed regulator reacts on the traffic detection and drosseling on demand.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity is available but only for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, App-integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and a HDMI socket are under the rest and are therefore slightly incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel is fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Who does not want to invest a lot to invest the petrol engines from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one turns for eternal, at night, in the morning there is no more hours before the wake of the wake, it is not possible to think about sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's all other as a relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">Anyway, the case of such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch-Institute, about a quarter of adults of adults and more than ten percent can be found their sleep often or permanently.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do not express me or sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleeping disorders, and there are many different causes underlying, emphasises Hans-Günter Wealth, member of the German Society for Schlaffing, and Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What is what you understand, is the Insomites, thus an input and a sleep disturbing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just the leep can sleep many people as uncertainty, or unstoppable, Jens Wagenknecht, member of the German Household association with practice in Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleeping disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind, organic, psychological, or-related factors, but also drugs are needed.</seg>
<seg id="12">No rarely is the illusion of any other disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early sewakening, particularly with depression," says Weeks. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be possible that various factors are needed.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, who has a herniated disc, bad, awaken all two to three hours, and starts every two to three hours, with respect to an all-day problems, and ensure an example, in case of course, Weeks, is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to the voltage, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">From when you should work with sleeping disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who does not have a period of one month in at least three nights per week and the day should be impacted as a doctor should go to Weak.</seg>
<seg id="19">The funicity can look completely different: one is beaten, tired, unmarked paths, has difficulties with the attention and the concentration, is easily accessible, tuning fluctuations or physical complaints such as Magi or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To prevent the sleeping trouble, it is important to figure out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a treatment options, including behavioral changes, a cognitive behavioural therapy or medicine - classical insets, only in the exceptional cases and most for two weeks - infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, specialized in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisciplinary chair of the Charité University of the Charité University in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, you should first contact with sleeping problems at first, in addition to other problems.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify whether the problems may have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who was to sleep in the sleeping lab, and what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, in the sleeping lab, medicine for instance, for instance, for instance, for instance, in case of anti-smokers, at insane, or when you don't change the cause of a sleeping bag, says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the examination, you don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please make any lunch sleep," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">After passing, you go into the bed one at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes of the body, one Nasal glasses, a chest strap and a flashers at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, there is also a camera on the ceiling of the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can your problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of parking, where you can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeks has to sleep on: regular sleeping and stand, not to sleep in bed, on the day not sleeping, not to sleep on the sleep, alcohol, and night not on the clock - then it starts immediately to be reckoned, and that is quite incompatible.</seg>

<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, Henkel has been a tough demonstration of the police against the project, as "no-Go-zone" as a "No-Go-zone" for police officers and 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After 22 June the rooms on the ground floor which were organised by the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, three weeks prior to official report, took part in the village, spersed parts of the road, and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile building construction workers on behalf of the unknown house owners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the company had been illegal and had been undergone by police and workers under the Jubel of sympathisers and inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">At this summer time the street is peaceful: parents walk with children's walk, people sit on the sidewalk before the houses in the sun, and so far to the late summer of late summer.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the building projects there are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left Violence is not the essentials of many occasions: Kerstin Neugebauer, which has been living in the pine since 1999, and Jana *, who comes here three children, especially from the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the skin project, they divide the concern before growing and decentring.</seg>
<seg id="15">It sounds not after a pine that wished to be a majority-owned police in front of vandalilie Left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The grabs, den of the Berlin Innensenator and the police make it between house and their neighbours, exists so apparently.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working-workers, which is today compared to the rest of the city as a lower average income and high poverty line.</seg>
<seg id="18">Home offices and those born-born residential projects have been occupied for pine: in 1990, many houses were occupied by the former GDR, almost all the entire mazer street near the Rigas near the Rigas.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer were trained at a big police battle, many of the projects were destroyed during the Rigas and were still inhabited by the people which they were occupied by the people before 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has increasingly becoming a magnets for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world: with them parts from the GDR-times and former house network have become their pine.</seg>
<seg id="21">This makes even during the diets, that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigas symbols are attacked as symbols for these development: they can be seen on slices of discs or freshly printed facades, which were exploited with colour flow.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year so often with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">The reason why not all the neighbors who believe it as a problem that they are not affected by the criminality, statistics such as body violate, statistics nearly exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest part of the disruption make nondamaged damage, the tensions rather the newly built and freshly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, which is living for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94, cannot be given any speech.</seg>
<seg id="27">As a result of violence, it is infinitely variable: the people in the 94 are its neighbors who have not been determined.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars give it directly in the Rigas no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For an architectural architect, this is no close focal point on its opposite, on the contrary, "here one helps each other, living on the street and gets more independent of one another."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has moved to the Rigas road and stayed in the Rigas road.</seg>
<seg id="31">As a consequence, it was so important that the people will return their streets: from the police, politics and media, which in July all suddenly the Deutédies suddenly appeared on the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of berries such as Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: through the slumless newbuildings built in former construction, which replenish the old residents.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to the fact that Property apartments, which are not interesting for many here - there are rather people who are not so well affected, "says it."</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction, I am absolutely not guilt."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do because if a never want to hear?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is also one of the police and the inhabitants on all sides.</seg>
<seg id="37">For more infamous, about colour bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding of understanding: the skin projects and the left scene were belonged to the pine.</seg>
<seg id="38">Whoever lives, should be aware of his - just like someone who draws in a pub district, there is a little noise about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All only have been presented with the person names, don't have to be called with their correct name.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuverle is a new refugee camp</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the response in terms of integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, she is a social worker in the place.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuverle has been enforced to refugees to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social educator has been supporting the management team at Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees as a response in contact for all actors: refugees, German refugees, administration, authorities and who are even mites.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer of the German states that the honorary capacity can be thankful more than thankful, Deuverle now is, the eives of Wollmillau, which has mostly a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">In such a few - less spies as much more than the multitude of desire may be targeted at targeted -, when the administration wanted to write the position.</seg>
<seg id="9">We are looking for a administrative management with a talent for Languages and people, associated with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, and a eiving of pure miljigau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work was not her central area, Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it will go to the organization, work with people on site and also behind the scenes and network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been running since around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent place on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was the highest time, "says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuverle honors and principal directors are supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organisational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon the containers are in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem, it has been recognized for some time to find apartments for the connecting blade.</seg>
<seg id="18">The communes are responsible for the connection of the municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have to accommodate the refugees in own or rented residential rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or renovation of these accommodations have to carry out the communes itself.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility is moving from the county office to Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search for some time has been very difficult for a lot of time.</seg>
<seg id="24">The administration has no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">You do not have so far not so far to work on private apartments, vanDeut.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, we need to be overthrown, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be installed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it's not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, are Regine customer and Annika Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, the training courses, training courses, school places, A-euro jobs and temporary activities for refugees and migrants, have to be folded or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places were good", "Regine customer."</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house, work-profit making work - and motivating and very well, such as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">You hopes that the work has to be a positive external effect on the basis of a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" no employment therapy. "</seg>
<seg id="35">But not only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day require a fixed structure, say Deuchle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People need to develop a set-up experience.</seg>
<seg id="38">So need it offers special features such as sport, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So well jump here and honorary publications.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling you wish to wish it and welcome them in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You need to explain the refugees that it takes about and it can be meaningful time, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who would like to help out the feeling of evolution, he could not work in Urbach niemanden, do not work yet and be innonsense that will never be able to integrate it.</seg>
<seg id="45">The significant majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, there is also, customer honestly honesting, "people who certainly doesn't matter." the work of Deuchle and customer is therefore always motivating.</seg>
<seg id="47">The everything is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: both of the recent facts were afraid of radicalization and radicalization, also in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"No," says Regine customer quite clearly, "what mancher naiv do like." a residual risk could not include, and do not include them.</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitive the helpers are sensitively sensitive to the helper.</seg>
<seg id="51">These events are also subject to refugees in the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">That had the fear that the attack is completely included in the call them.</seg>
<seg id="53">You want to show that they have nothing to do anything, "says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So, main and honorary visits to place and in the region will hold out in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have always in the background that soon, a new stored on refugees and Migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Needs Germany?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer the policy: politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it's unfair to pursue helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">In Urbach we are not yet arrived, where we would like to go, "says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher also has already been able to integrate the previous people are reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="63">That are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people in need to help them, both women are in need.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world's political situation is complicated, since there is no simple responses.</seg>
