8 The fraction are that by saying that Donald Tru@@ mp is to be up@@ ward .
some have tried it to brand new as a flop .
you have done it as a kid .
and some await its collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to pull up Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper cat@@ ches , down to it , it does not work ( still ) .
ten of the last 11 national inter@@ questions , Donald Tru@@ mp showed that in the double @-@ digit account , and some begin to get serious , what does it imp@@ ose for the opportunities of nom@@ ination to the real estate .
of course , it is still to be early in the elect@@ oral term .
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp can bear the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts pre@@ lines that , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys has been delivered to the ascent to the demands of Herman Cain , of which none of them became a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons to fight in a general election .
but up@@ side groups such as J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s &apos;s Super P@@ AC and the conservative tab@@ loid recommendations are recogni@@ zing Tru@@ mps flow assets and start their dollars , to fall it .
here are some current re@@ fraction , which indicate that the real estate business is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mps popularity has been rot@@ ated by 180 degrees .
just before the Donald Tru@@ mp has announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a query made from Mon@@ mouth University concluded that only two of ten others took the real estate in Mog@@ ul .
until mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
in the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now we have six of 10 Republi@@ can and a positive conclusion of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
these figures keep in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has found the last week that 60 percent of the public@@ ans have seen a good opinion from Tru@@ mp .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ W@@ ab GO@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp and candidates .
in the 2002 Time / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ can force , they are either impressed , &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; when Tru@@ mp would be nominated .
only two of 10 say they would be , &quot; if he would be a candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same thing as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , which the same applies to Tru@@ mp ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 % of the republi@@ can vot@@ ers said that they &apos;re not happy , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ a , which would be the candidate .
a majority of the Repub@@ lics are not considered as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is reli@@ ed for his mat@@ ch@@ imp@@ lications , a 52 percent share of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the vot@@ ers that the real estate site has the right temper@@ ament to its president . ABC News / Washington Post are on Monday .
the same number is subject to the first major state of State , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans are described , he stated the personality of a commander in Chief according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac one week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think he &apos;s not the personality to run effectively and run almost six of 10 % , so his temper@@ ament is not into the White House P@@ asse , by ABC / Post .
republi@@ can vot@@ ers get spo@@ iled to the idea .
if they put her unc@@ le@@ ware , republi@@ can W@@ ab Tru@@ mp to real , for real .
if you &apos;ll need to be asked if the most of the GO@@ P nom@@ ination was based on a survey done by CNN / OR@@ C in the last week , four of ten that Tru@@ mp was the best bet .
this is an change from the time when four of ten was not opposed to J@@ eb Bush since the end of July .
complete finish : GO@@ P @-@ W@@ ab had not the clear crystal ball in the past .
at this time , four of ten orders were prepared , Rick Per@@ ry has been the nom@@ ination and only 28 % of the final candidate were Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a large number of GO@@ P @-@ W@@ hi@@ ers Tru@@ mps campaign is shown as a pl@@ um effect .
even if the public@@ ans gathered up some of the members , Tru@@ mp can still practically go almost every .
some experts point out that sm@@ ashed into Tru@@ mps &apos;s role probably led to Tru@@ mps leaders during the Anti @-@ Tru@@ mp Support to more than a dozen of other candidates .
however , a survey taken at the Mon@@ mouth University will be reflected in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp , and the most popular vote .
he ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio , 14 points ahead of Walker 15 points , before j@@ eb , 19 points , and finally ahead of Paul , John Ka@@ ak and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ in @-@ head @-@ race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate , that proposes him ?
Ben Car@@ son invited the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a cris@@ p majority of Donald &apos;s Tru@@ mp @-@ fans says that they have composed their opinion .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday show that only a little more than half of the vot@@ ers , the Tru@@ mp , could say that they have their vote .
obviously much you have happened , in order to change this , and no one can really say , never change the opinion .
46 per cent said that they could be open to the door to change other men .
yet Tru@@ mps the top of the competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon , Ben Car@@ son , and vot@@ ers , who made their opinion that they are twice as often as high for Tru@@ mp .
six of 10 judges say that they agree with Tru@@ mp to match the subject of in@@ migration .
since the incident of Donald Tru@@ mp in his elect@@ oral victory over two months ago , the immigrants from Mexico was called &quot; rap@@ ist , &quot; the immigration to form and fishing spot in the public dis@@ course will take place .
some are wor@@ ried that the bom@@ bas@@ al expression of Tru@@ mp forms a vital His@@ p@@ anic era from the Republi@@ can party and the re@@ ori@@ ance efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey on Monday , six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans that it deal with Tru@@ mp to agree with questions from the relevant nature .
as long as the in@@ migration in the spotlight will remain in the spotlight , it will be done to Donald Tru@@ mp .
the eye on the government f@@ climb@@ s over the government .
in the Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Mon@@ son , meanwhile , about half of the support of Republi@@ can elect@@ or@@ ate , mainly through its out@@ sider status .
six of 10 suppliers can say in the new Mon@@ days @-@ survey by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as a residential experience .
and they are also aw@@ ned in Washington .
a survey carried out by D@@ es Mo@@ ines : Bloomberg , in I@@ owa before two weeks ago , that three of four I@@ owa @-@ Repub@@ lic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the re@@ public@@ ans , 54 percent &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 percent .

in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion was the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .

even though the Bavaria had dominated the dominant game , Pir@@ an@@ con@@ i@@ fers had con@@ spic@@ uous .
however , at the por@@ ters , however , was a court .

who smoke , has a higher risk of teeth
whoever believes , you smoke , not only that the lungs , but also in addition - this is not close to Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study .
the good message : at the fore@@ going , the risk does not sink .
smo@@ kers only have a clearly increased risk of losing their teeth in early .
it is provided for the long @-@ term study of an international research project , among them several members of the German Institute for Health Research ( DI@@ E ) in Potsdam .

he has also taken the idea of talking that other colleagues is taken by speech , and that John Ber@@ cow , as the speaker of the company , are addressed to discuss the problem .

Met@@ rics will start soil vit@@ ality campaign to the control of al@@ di@@ zation
met@@ rics tried to protect the IG@@ A locations in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholesale industry in Ireland has launched a land starting campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia to the ahead of a 700 million US $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di is ready for the opening of two sales centers and Western Australia for the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia , in early next year , it will build up@@ stream tunnels and build the IG@@ A brand through Main@@ stream marketing and marketing the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ aide @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A estimates and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , which are distributed in IG@@ A shops and shop owner , which sell very che@@ ap@@ est tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected to go further details of its Defense Strategy on September 29 , when the wholesale dealers for food , alcohol and devices has leading an annual revenue strategy .
it stands a lot in the game as South Australia and Western Australia almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s IG@@ A shop makes up to generate even higher profits as the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the Eastern states .
buyers and Western Australia were both interested in South Australia and Western Australia , with more than 30 percent fewer than in South Australia , Victoria and Queensland , Australia . Australia equ@@ es more than 30 percent of Western Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia .
however , analysts at Morgan Stanley announced that Al@@ di twelve months after the opening of its first markets , some five percent of the food market in these two countries will come away and coming all of the original industries , but mainly independent individual retailers .
a report published in this week &apos;s analysis , Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley announced that IG@@ A retailers will lose 360 US $ a year in cash $ 1,800 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will gather in the next year 25 locations in SA and 30 in WA , and will generate revenue of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food production , and on the amount of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s , was a cash cost of cash in cash flows about 13 million before interest and taxes , Mr Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ rics introduced market shares in the Eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a survey carried out of Roy Morgan , found that IG@@ A buyers are the following test .
Morgan Stanley takes over that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s recorded sales at 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 . it will reduce its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading F@@ ond@@ s@@ Manager of Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , will be at a business performance in Melbourne , that is likely to disappear within a decade .
met@@ a opposed it to react to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass . it is to be found on the comments given to Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ bonus to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s last week is going to have contact with Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s last week .
IG@@ A market share has decreased by 18 percent to 14 percent , and information from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s food and food retailers , which at approximately 1,200 IG@@ A retail outlets , has been decreased by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operating result of g@@ ulation for simultaneous print and mar@@ ches .
the wholesale dealers , however , is investing up to $ 150 million to offer prices on sale of Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ aters in hundreds of products every week , to improve their stores with fast growing food foods and provide a better selection of private and low @-@ time foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the prizes and shop program to come to El@@ an , hopes that the wholesale dealers will return to ever again in for four years in 2017 .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ ksgiving and kin@@ ak@@ is deser@@ ves to have been deser@@ ved to medi@@ cally for his behavior .
the co@@ ca@@ ine is one of the &quot; Koll@@ ater@@ partition &quot; in a recent wind around his friend &apos;s Nick Hei@@ de , who has been deser@@ ved to mark the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly and praised as criticism of its own behavior .
the name &quot; co@@ ca@@ ak@@ is , &quot; the younger brother Du@@ os , which will always be called &quot; Special KS . &quot; adds support to the inf@@ amous pro@@ mon@@ aut of Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ v@@ ka on the Montreal Masters of Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan .
in a fi@@ ery trials in Cinc@@ inn@@ ati shortly afterwards , Kok@@ ra@@ ak@@ is and his opponent had to be separated from the arbit@@ rat@@ ors where Har@@ rison said , &quot; Wa@@ v@@ r@@ ka would not take away the car , and do not recommend the child . &quot;
while he was seen , as He had seen a tennis bat , a branch with a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , had been defended from He@@ it@@ ak@@ is from He@@ it@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently playing Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gro@@ th to second place in a single place behind Bernard To@@ mic in the Davis Cup half @-@ final against Great Britain .
one thing about that I have quite a con@@ i@@ fer , is the fact that after my view , Than@@ asi , and a little over the fight inv@@ oked , &quot; said He@@ aly .
he has one but@@ t of the dogs if he lost it . he is not the first player who lost a bat of Fr@@ ust , and has broken with by itself , and I am really great enough to know that he is not proud .
but this really true he has made us extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think that he earned a lot of recognition .
he just gathered a great team around , he has a great family around , and I think that it was a bit too strictly on a strictly command .
he is a thri@@ ver 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he compl@@ ain a problem with the other players , he is well in the shape , he is a very stable and more young talent , and I think he deser@@ ves it , after his own services , he will be judged .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to take non @-@ mand@@ y by the vote , which began on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return home at the sole head of the team . &quot;
first , &quot; first we wish that the team is fully concentr@@ ates on all the contest , and not all the contro@@ vers@@ y are all &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ ps &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I think this was the user to make him though , and did not try to make him easier , but we try to understand him the consequences of his trading . some time outside the ra@@ mp can remember , in which he may think of very fair , and it &apos;s best for the team where he is the best for him .

election 2016 : Clinton &apos;s lead to Ber@@ nie S@@ contrary to the national survey .
the former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to continue a double @-@ digit increase in the democratic race at the nom@@ ination of national race , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders is win across the ground .
Clinton has now support 47 percent of democratic vot@@ ers in the presidential elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ differently stands at second place , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who is not pleased with the presidential candidate , receives support for 15 percent of the democratic revolution in the presidential elections .
more than five months before the election of the sel@@ ections , most of the democratic vot@@ ers , that it is too early to say that their opinion is certain , which men can support them .
but Clin@@ ica supports more than one of the other candidates , however , as one of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Agency , Clinton has lost with a number of demographic groups , while S@@ differently won several win@@ nings .
Clinton holds a big advantage in women and restra@@ ined , but these origins have reduced .
its support for the men is dec@@ lining significantly , and the differently it looks back here with 5 points .
Clin@@ ica &apos;s advantage for their democratic vot@@ ers under the age of 50 has over@@ volati@@ li@@ zed , and she and S@@ anders is now in the same height .
however , Clinton has had a big advantage over the older B@@ aster .
last month , Clinton was att@@ ed with double @-@ digit margin in the Liber@@ al , but S@@ anders is now a 5 @-@ point margin in this group .
about half of the democratic vot@@ ers in the presidential elections so they would like to support their enthusiasm . by the party , they would be nominated by the party .
one quarter would like to support them with some device , support a further 15 percent , they would only support the ch@@ equ@@ ered network .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprisingly , that Clinton &apos;s current Supp@@ ans is above all of it .
the views are stronger with those who are currently not support us - only about one quarter I would help them .
while 48 percent of democratic vot@@ ers in the presidential elections they did not support to but they can support less republi@@ can vot@@ ers for its best candidate in Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ tons is asked in an open question why she is the most common solution that she is the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the table , that a woman &apos;s President is met ( 13 percent ) , and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
a soft &apos;s supporters also supports their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
agreement to the treatment with the problems and the di@@ alling option is also quoted .
since the vice president is a potential for the presidency in the Wa@@ ag@@ r@@ ath , 57 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers in the Presi@@ dential election in the race - though a third believes it should not do it .
if democratic vot@@ ers must be asked in the presidential election , who would be the party a second choice , Bi@@ den is at the fore@@ front .
from Clin@@ t tra@@ gers tell more than half , that bi@@ ds would be quite differently .
no longer wanted to take part for the nom@@ ination of the de@@ mar@@ ries , a new , Clinton &apos;s lead to s@@ anders in advance , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race run to 30 points without it in the race .
give a five @-@ five percent of democratic vot@@ ers in Clinton , than Kan@@ s@@ atin offers the best chance to win the election , but this figure is getting to 78 percent the last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second at this measurement , but the percentage , which might be seen as the &quot; selectable gains . &quot;
nevertheless , at the question of what candidates is important , the demo@@ cra@@ dle , the elect@@ or@@ ate of the vot@@ ers .
similar to the last month , no only democratic candidate or potential candidate for the vot@@ ers of the presidential election appears as un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidate , or potential candidates provide good results in some important individual measures in the sel@@ ections of their party .
us consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as a tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ ew@@ ays with strong leadership .
Bi@@ den cuts at the top of the three candidates , best starting with hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ t &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of democratic vot@@ ers believe not that Clinton &apos;s tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy is twice that many as many say that is very different ( 15 per cent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion about it .
democratic ... El@@ ections on the presidential election in general also Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ th@@ ide@@ ological in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic vot@@ ers was not any opinion from S@@ differently .
because questions concerning the creation of a personal e @-@ mail address and an server during the mandate , launched as Secretary of State , the majority of the elect@@ or@@ ate of the presidential election with their statement is to be noted that there were not opinions on opinions .
but it is a separate history in the American public .
one half of the Americans is now un@@ happy with their statement , while only a third is satisfied .
the public opinion was located in March , shortly after the problem of the light arrived .
most Americans thought that the e @-@ mail address do not have any effect on their general opinions of Clinton , while 36 per cent said that its opinion has been deteri@@ or@@ ated out .
there are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of them , that have no chance to play their views of Clinton .
although Clinton was able to be tru@@ st@@ worthy of their party by tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy , this is still a problem for being registered to a registered office , just 32 percent , it is honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than the last month and 15 percent less since May .
valid for a portion of 62 percent of the voting age they did not go for a honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 % of the vot@@ er sites present so Tru@@ mp was not honest and does not tru@@ st@@ any .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp can be obtained with good notes at the same time .

Ben Car@@ son is located in the recent survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind the C@@ BS News / New York Times

Republi@@ can W@@ vot@@ ers supported country far to Tru@@ mp , with great number . support from 23 % in the last month &apos;s C@@ BS @-@ survey conducted by Fox News debate in the past month , increased 27 % in the pol@@ l .
but Car@@ son sch@@ oss in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the pol@@ l revealed that Car@@ son demo@@ graphical or@@ graphic groups are enough , and Tru@@ mp can be out@@ performed with higher education users .
the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina , Ohio @-@ Governor John Ka@@ oss , has beaten in Wis@@ con@@ ea , Scott Walker , who fell in deepest on the deepest ocean , and the remaining 10 % support to now 2 % .
a former vice @-@ Governor J@@ eb Bush , former Governor of Ar@@ kan@@ sas , Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are among 6 % in the third place .
the error mar@@ ge for the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can Wä@@ den@@ ers in that most recent pol@@ l is , Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the newest version of CNN / OR@@ C @-@ survey was published last week that Car@@ son speaks in p@@ olls - it &apos;s going on with 19 % support from the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp and 32 % support .
the youngest survey by ABC News / Washington Post showed , Tru@@ mp also showed mark@@ edly lower than Car@@ son .
looking at a glance at the last week of the Car@@ son h@@ ull , Tru@@ mp was h@@ unted to the former neuro@@ sur@@ geon shooting themselves . Car@@ son themselves vic@@ tors for this .

five members of the Brotherhood rejected the death of a bar@@ ren College .
almost two years after a student almost a student of an attempt , as a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , passed away to five persons in the body of Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch D@@ i Delta PSI @-@ Camp Memorial Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g has taken over and del@@ u@@ ated in our hospital in September 2013 , and to have contributed to the hospital , the police informed the police .
personnel from him , he was charged with a connected eyes with a 30 @-@ Po@@ und back@@ pack of sand , and was reg@@ res@@ sed , while he was trying to flee their frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then I fell to un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i Delta PSI @-@ Muslim Brotherhood , not the emergency number 911 , had moved to Den@@ g and had to wait for an hour before she brought him to a hospital , just the police .
however , they had the time to switch to mar@@ eng@@ s clothing , whose symptoms go to g@@ og@@ gles of the Brotherhood , and Andy Men@@ g , to receive the National President of the Brotherhood , said the police officer Chris Wagner at a press conference .
in this point , the members of the mine had to hide and assembled the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood , &quot; said Dr. Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Political System Wagner .
he was not revi@@ ved , and he died on the next morning in his morning .
after a aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g has been donated to the physical strength , feed , h@@ ull @-@ powers .
many families were destroyed by the soldiers of the Brotherhood . at least one student he died in 1970 every year , said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents the D@@ eng@@ s family , in a statement .
Bru@@ eder@@ es and their members need to be drawn to the mathematical power , and this step of authorities is very important .
one County Grand Jury from Mon@@ ro@@ e received an indictment for murder of the third party of members for the first five members .
two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , will also accused of bi@@ ous attacks , and formation of a criminal organisation .
we will not only work the participating people , but if there is an organisation , which - officially un@@ official - have been officially declared this year , &quot; says Wagner , &quot; says Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch is forbidden to the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood is to use their position to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases the interest
a interest rate hike , and the house will catch the banks of catch up , return to vote loans , and the economy is going to guide through a recession .
we know .
so we don &apos;t know how long will last anything and how long it will keep .
in particular , the history for the economy does feature low guidance for the exp@@ iry .
a recession came in with only 11 months following the first interest rate and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ vity of the Federal Reserve at the loss of interest rates is often , if not always , a factor will react to the economy and the financial systems .
therefore , the representatives of the US Central Bank has so strange that investors should not focus on that they would not focus , but rather , to raise the interest rates , but rather much at that time , which is needed for the norm@@ alization .
in fact , several options will play a role .
at the end , market atten@@ de@@ es could be noted that the whole excitement was over@@ laid on a rate of interest .
the initial increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will be clari@@ fied by a signal which will be interpreted by the end of the era of the &quot; bil@@ l@@ al abilities , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication with customers .
contrary , we don &apos;t expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal heights , but still on a low level to fear the se@@ ism@@ atic Scho@@ ck that can seem to as much to fear .
that means , however , does not mean that it will be no effect on it .
here is a historical test @-@ based view , as to react to the other areas of the economy :
as the market seen in the last month , the pre@@ load of interest of interest has to be more volati@@ le .
once the rise in , the influence is not so dramatic .
there seems to be a tendency to re@@ sign from the 12 to 24 months after the first completed , which may re@@ vo@@ iced back into account of monetary policy , &quot; the Deutsche Bank analy@@ st could change in a recent study what happened after interest of the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market has been growing - about 14 percent in the past 35 years ( average profit of 2.6 % ) and an average yield of around 14.@@ 4 percent year ago , according to a current analysis made by Bob D@@ oll , chief of the asset manager in Nu@@ ron &apos;s Asset Management , in Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares would rise to the shares , and the return start will begin to reduce themselves .
Rez@@ es@@ thous@@ es are a fact of business life , but interest @-@ bank@@ ments and very often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions , who did not accelerate in advance and accelerate the recession .
extremely interesting is that the gross domestic product will be close to one of the lowest point in a rate hike by F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 million Swiss francs has twice per share of the nominal GDP since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few months expect this is well @-@ lasting and expected to expect Atlanta F@@ ed to Atlanta F@@ ed in third quarter .
interest of interest in such a frag@@ ile economic dimension could be ris@@ t and disc@@ ard the question , &quot; if it is different this time , &quot; said Deutsche Bank .
market participants have made a whole year on a rate hike in the F@@ ed , and all eyes were held at the session of the Federal Cultural Market Committee of this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econo@@ mi@@ sts believe that the FO@@ MC could permit an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures business could only gain an increase of 25 percent .
in our study , all financial cycles from 1950 to date , in a Super cycle with increasing swing in GDP and before @-@ boost growth , very quickly after the start of recovery in the shade , &quot; says the report .
in contrast , this is a clear recovery of what the worst recession having observed the worst recession .
the current cycle is by far the longest track , which F@@ ed has maintained the last recession in the end of the past recession ; the record was 35 months , and this date 74 months now .
the fixed income was also more volati@@ le , since the market is a interest @-@ rate hike , and the patterns is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than if its shares , if its strategic course change .
for bonds , the yields are planning to change the direction , once the first gain / cutting in the cycle is performed .
at the end of the subscription @-@ cycle the arrival cycle are immediately paying so immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ists from Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates suggested that the result is a longer period of short and shorter bonds , just ahead of a drop in the curve .
while in such a climate change increases , we often bring very interesting net income , although &quot; we are able to expect higher income ; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ zer at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
interesting is what Jones believes that the markets are already adapted to F@@ ed strategy @-@ ups .
in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of the inflation practice , there are some evidence that the market adapted to the higher money market policy , &quot; wrote them .
short @-@ term interest have risen , the loan which is fl@@ atter , credit can do themselves and the Vol@@ ati@@ l@@ ity has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed broke its strategy .
while big and throughout the business , companies are wrap up the larger part of its business into the US , they can profit if interest rates are rising and local products .
multinational companies with high debt is worse , since a number of dollars have made their products in the global market , as well as financing of its debt .
the story shows that &quot; quality - &quot; shares tend to react very positive , three months after an initial interest rate hike - , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs analysts at a report for the customer .
companies have strong balance sheet , in 1994 with low balance sheet , after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 , by 5 percentage points .
the company with high capital income and lower Vol@@ ati@@ l@@ ity in their shares also exceeded its full quality with lower quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
deb@@ ts are a tremendous problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , gold man said that Gold@@ man said .
consumers besides of the pure stock games , consumers also benefit from the rising .
spar@@ er could see profits by higher income , even if experts of different articles will take place how fast it will take place .
the BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , &quot; Speaker and Andrew Bin@@ gham
as a member of the parliament , the Conserv@@ ative Member of Parliament cri@@ tic@@ ised the transmitter for his &quot; worsen@@ ing . &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he has not made a lot of commercial @-@ rival , too .
he also led to the BBC Music Awards , and said that they only have The Br@@ its i@@ mi@@ zer
research @-@ colleague Dami@@ en Coll@@ ins , which is the broadcast of The Voice , in addition , is that this is not original .
BBC Radio 3 , &quot; converts the Classic FM , claims a leading parliamentary system and increases the new pressure on the transmitter , to prove it does not do something the private broadcast@@ ers does not do .
in Andrew Bin@@ gham , the Conserv@@ ative and member of Andrew Bin@@ gham also said to determine the BBC &apos;s public radio stations and has increasingly been unable to deal more from his commercial competitors .
&quot; radio 3 appears - I have been using the word &quot; Ver@@ rier &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also led to the BBC Music Awards , which began in the last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which began in last year , seem to be suffering from another name under another name .
so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontane@@ ously examples , where you only have the examples of what you are actually looking for the market , &quot; said Mr Bin@@ gham .
BBC film director pointed out the crime scene and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 has argu@@ ed far ahead of his commercial competi@@ tor when he goes to the public for live music and education .
what I went from radio 3 works , that will I learn more about classical music and somewhere else .
and there are a commitment to live music and music , which is really un@@ surpassed .
&quot; and the involvement from Radio 3 to find new music , new music , and new works have been too hard to give I it really , &quot; he said .
in early this year , the BBC Radio 3 Controller , Alan Dav@@ ey had made that harder than to be involved in the past , had to be involved in the past when the British has informed less about classic music .
radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production , which during the hearing on the process for the selection of culture , media and sports , has put under fire to mount the commercial bas@@ eline on your feet .
the T@@ ory member for Dami@@ en Coll@@ ins has been the The Voice of Music Director of the BBC , which was bought by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of $ 22 million .
see , why this program often is discussed because it is not original and not striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - including Pal@@ oma Fa@@ ith and Boy George - was produced on special BBC mode . &quot;
he added , it is added that the company &quot; introduces a hit from our house company , &quot; If the next time it has a fun racing series .
however , he refused to order the order of other series of The Voice in the future , or pay a money of the Bill@@ ers for other entertainment formats .

operation of ai@@ ch / DO@@ B for lack of imp@@ acting
the Provin@@ cial Court Klagenfurt did on Wednesday two officials under the Austrian volleyball court , I@@ vory Coast I@@ DO@@ B , because of lack of ach@@ ev@@ ing and conf@@ is@@ cation .
the def@@ endants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them was also charged for abuse of authority during one of them .
under a proposal , he was acqu@@ itted without further appeal of charges in May .
the current trial was tag@@ ung .
according to the tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel up on the check @-@ up was found that the def@@ endants were to be carried out in the years 2006 to 2011 and were allowed to disp@@ ose to their functions of disp@@ oni@@ zation , used for private purposes .
the damage is charged with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sport @-@ functional are also charged for financial services .
this fact is the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ er @-@ based Judge , Micha@@ ela San@@ in , Germany .
it should be later to a later date .
for the delay of the lack of interest , the defense given that the association was up to no date one year later .
the sport recording had only been anticip@@ ating and experienced a sports club but has been invested in the industry from 1982 to 2011 and invested a lot of time and money could come from the debt . it conduc@@ ts in 2001 about 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( around 4@@ 4.000 euros ) .
at that time we were before the situation : we lead the club or locked us ? , &quot; says one of the accused but joined the bro@@ min@@ ers in the bro@@ min@@ ers of the financial year .
according to his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take this task .
with any risks .
&quot; we have money forward , our life insurance companies , and security in the Bank , &quot; he told them that .
have been agreed with the Verein for free : you can manage the money free , it only may be made no deb@@ ts .
furthermore , it had been with the appropriate financial year , the payout on charges of decre@@ asing damages to 1991 had been decided .
therefore , I have a part of the decision to make it only years later , namely , of 2003 , when a Plus had been spent on the account .
therefore , Pau@@ line and not detailed pictures , explained and explained all these processes , explained the processes that was explained .
the accounts and su@@ perf@@ ections administered by the two def@@ endants , said the second co @-@ def@@ endants during the time .
why re@@ deposits of the association had not been revealed in detail , the Judge , the judge .
the organisation did not be interested in detail for the financial statements , only the debt was important , so the answer .
in 2011 , against which a function of investig@@ ative investigations began to the United States , an amount of EUR 120@@ ,000 was transferred to the United States .
the accused were having had a def@@ endants .
this securities due to the name of the second time , and was not known as the non @-@ profit organisation .
&quot; why ? , &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
the interview was not a answer .
then he stated , at that time , he stated that it was the best for the society .
if he was something that happened if no one would have something of that money , the prosecutor took in the room .
the co @-@ def@@ endants have been informed , based on the operation .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; claims @-@ tion . &quot;
why was the biggest bill to the effect ? , we wanted to know Judge , and Prosecutor .
the one also the first of the accused , he would have been with this form@@ ulating , because the organisation never have been found to be found damage .
but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; you are with what are you all from the Schneider . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was a legal representative ? &quot; &quot;
he also said the function , he has never been a cent content , he calcul@@ ates just a kilometer of growing and di@@ ets .
at di@@ ets , he had provided € 1,000 a month in receipt of the club , however , the actual burden was much higher than it , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not show the accused .
these were indeed been evaluated according to a function test , in which everything was considered as correct , they did not have been kept .
the od@@ ometer add also included the second co @-@ def@@ endants .
all containers are kept in cash , so he said to be from his residence of the law to the Bank in Blei@@ burg , he declared to lead in his testimony .
the main trial is being continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .

there was no explanation for his shots .

despite reports on Monday , that is supposed to be as a relationship with Schmidt presented a relationship with Schmidt as the Tuesday , there is no information , no proof &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
according to Sha@@ wn O &quot; Ste@@ am , who pointed out that she was only seven years to live , as a &quot; good man &quot; described .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United is not playing monthly because of double @-@ correction
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a dual frame of his right B@@ one after the Champions League Cup from Manchester on the PS@@ V Eindhoven in front of the PS@@ V Eindhoven in front .
while this is the left exterior made to wine , and that it will be able to close him for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al should not hope to play Sha@@ w &apos;s hope to play Sha@@ w for the future .
the violation was caused by the pre@@ operative attack of H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was set in the PS@@ V @-@ area .
he was treated nine minutes on the pitch and required oxygen before he was brought to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double t@@ inc@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he shall shut down tomorrow , or perhaps a day later and then in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United has it very difficult to it and then it happens .
in the dressing room , he had a oxygen mask .
he we@@ eping .
I have not a physician , but if you have a double wal@@ be , then the six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season back again .
Mor@@ eno is happy to be one Red map and the suspension of a cluster .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rat@@ ors are certainly not yet pen@@ alised with the arbit@@ ers .
van Ga@@ al believed that the Italian arbit@@ ers was mistaken .
you can judge about themselves , when I say that a Elf@@ meter and an red map were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account : &quot; I thank you all for your news . words can not describe as en@@ ut@@ t I am , my way to the game , I will get back again . &quot;
in fact : Manchester United @-@ related the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the defeat of the PS@@ V
the United Nations @-@ def@@ enders has been able to recover an additional inc@@ entive for him in the next June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; It &apos;s a very sh@@ ici@@ an injury . &quot;
if a player leaves this place in violation of the place , all of which is sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to inf@@ rin@@ gement .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg way that was played in Mexico for Van Ga@@ as the World Cup at the World Championship in 2014 .
it &apos;s hard not hard , because it wasn &apos;t your intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear , that there is a very sh@@ a@@ ob@@ li@@ ous injury , this is not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u .
at the moment , it was not possible for me to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball which was in another direction on the way , so it looked touched by , as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
inside conversation with S@@ FF@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno , &quot; I know how it feels like it , I feel like hard to be something like it .
I feel very poor , but I feel so tired .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado has also been taken to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ as from Chris Sm@@ ack .
certainly knows David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all the parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will take no long time until you know it almost .
it is unless you are perhaps David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite p@@ book was asked , and the Minister @-@ President of The Lor@@ enz , which was elected in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , too close to a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and went un@@ moving his book : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and a powerful message , which I like to give my children , since it seems to give a picture or a message , which we have so far missed . &quot;
everything pretty and well , except that the following volume , in which Cameron is supposed to be a summary of the book that included a summary of the film version of 2012 , which added new characters and details to be extended to build a quite short original text @-@ text .
among the w@@ alled city of the need , where all nature have gone , and even the air &apos; T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , had to meet a love to her dreams , &quot; she had great name Theodor Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss , formerly found and died in 1991 , but not unknown .
if that is still not to be a bad enough : the text of David Cameron came anywhere close to the website , where all artists is thought , and even the air is a commodity , that a boy named T@@ ed , a heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
despite being a pra@@ g@@ able father , it seems un@@ likely to be a little familiar , such as the local environment caused by making poverty , leaves , and , despite the pro@@ testing of the name Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck , schn@@ ur@@ ning nature , &quot; which says by the names of the trees , &quot; says .
the most likely , such a relatively low PR @-@ task is a hel@@ per , which The Lor@@ ax was not read more than 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning @-@ Street Spre@@ cher@@ er said that the text was probably come to a circular page by Cam@@ er@@ ons .
super Camp@@ s confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ ons was to be delivered , but there are no additional immediate reports .
Adam Ly@@ th was obviously threatened by an expul@@ sion from English football team , but it is still difficult
in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , the difficult task , but if one has a difficult task , but if one has chosen the k@@ aders , to see the UK for the tour , re@@ covering a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not limited on my card .
I would not close a down@@ ward victory .
A@@ last@@ air Co@@ oks also means less than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ player in the Batt@@ les @-@ set , and the community &apos;s residence , it &apos;s not sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a ju@@ ly positive setting .
the ball developed the Mo@@ een Ali as a spin @-@ Bow@@ l and Adi@@ das Ras@@ hid , even , when it was an unknown size in the test , is an option for the attack .
please note this news : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving from the England @-@ test @-@ car and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision , made Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is fine for me as its head trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , home .
in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that critics are at the fore@@ front .
there was no question marks in Joe Ro@@ ot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I said it - players their own best check @-@ in .
before a long time , we have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control the control over his own fate .
if he hop@@ efully further L@@ unch in New Yor@@ k@@ shire , 2014 will say a further chance .
the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss has appointed his position , even though he brought not so good performance , and surprise make me , he is mainly a team man .
the question , how much time was an evaluation board , gets to initi@@ ate his sign is difficult .
Ly@@ th became seven chances of be@@ ating how Sam Rob@@ son did before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton receives nine chances of him .
only comp@@ ton get a chance to do home and back@@ wards .
the single &apos;s design that I can watch , was that Britain was first organized by Jonathan Tro@@ is in the Caribbean - but the lost time in the past was now a lost time in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is now past ; and he &apos;s a stroke occurs I rates .
he is an X @-@ factor C@@ cket@@ player , which we saw at home at Yor@@ k@@ shire in the early season when he met 2@@ 36 with us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge in front of us .
it must have at least the same opportunities as that in front of him , but this depends , of course , it makes it imp@@ acting in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea , as well as Cook &apos;s d@@ shore to shine , which would bring an extra spin @-@ spin and get four qui@@ cks by the weekend , and I don &apos;t know anything .
I do not see why a drummer who cannot go there , and this bus is already shown that he is a depth of Cri@@ cket @-@ player .
Mo@@ een did not get its job in his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s no number 3 for them , and there is no major difference .
my first team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests during the first drop before he joined the Op@@ ening in 2001 .
he has managed to offer three hundred R@@ us and look back .
Zaf@@ ar Ans@@ ari will uph@@ old in the header of a Back @-@ up call to carry out and will greatly impressed me as a young man in my limited manner .
people see your statistics on average - on average 31 with the goal and 35 with the ball , and think , it &apos;s a sh@@ unt , but there is no major number of Backup sp@@ ades , which says their hands , and the coach have opted for youth .
in this tour , he will learn a lot to learn on this tour .
in addition from the team , England has made a few smart supplements from the user .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ a , the council of Sri Lanka , of the council of Sri Lanka , is the place to be a re@@ coup .
he is one of the n@@ ett@@ est Ker@@ le of the game , who bring a great amount of experiences , since he played under all conditions , and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white @-@ hole @-@ phase of the tour and takes a powerful application into the setup .
however , I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition , player or as coach , and as Mah@@ ela , he gives insights , from which we can benefit .
sometimes , new votes at the dressing room , fresh air , even if the news is in line with what is fore@@ seen .
children &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not deployed with the One @-@ Day@@ ers , Ro@@ ot was given a similar break against Australia and I do not have a problem .
some are not agree , but cre@@ ek , and team construc@@ ts determine not the time schedule .
and you have to remember that as with players will depend on the results of the results .
such decisions are not hit by their own heart .

German Chancellor Angela Merkel was a minister of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and wants to leave the office for a past 10 years , before it is po@@ or@@ ly bad for her than T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
it is also a ver@@ dic@@ ated force .
Poland will soon be a nation@@ alist rights government , Spain had a left trial .
it &apos;s difficult to imagine that they could be a break in order to avoid the sel@@ f@@ ie forced to prevent them from the UK , Scotland chose a withdrawal from UK , something that they do not want to have the most similar soil cultivation .
thus , some such ministers should not require to not@@ orious them yet , not in the SN@@ P style , while the United @-@ speaking media campaign race will accelerate in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ ite process , have been suspected of having .

experts cri@@ tic@@ ised the report of Public Health England on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ financed agency , that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are lower than smoking , and they came out of a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to tobacco industry , and the researchers .
experts pre@@ sto in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) officially got to Lanc@@ et by the Public Health Court ( PH@@ Y ) , which cri@@ tic@@ ised by Public Health England ( PH@@ Y ) in their report for e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
PH@@ E published the &quot; Basic principles &quot; over the last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have raised the load capacity of data and published on the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a mission in the medical journal Lanc@@ et celebrated the &quot; extra@@ vag@@ ant basis , &quot; on the PH@@ E present its most important conclusion .
two further researchers have taken place in BM@@ J and we asked whether the alleg@@ ations &quot; is on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Organization for Health , Research and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ demi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies are based on the detection of efficacy . &quot;
they told that the fact that this claim of PH@@ E that &quot; the present best estimate is that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are to w@@ rest@@ ling with 95 % fewer crops , than cigar@@ ette , referring to a detailed review of the modelling and modelling .
in fact , this statement consists of a single meeting of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ point economic Analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Analysis ( MC@@ DA ) , to result of opinions on various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ hal@@ o products ; the results of this meeting were presented in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that there was a sponsor of the English company called the Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose director was received before British American Tob@@ acco ( the BAT ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of the BAT of Public Health in an Sustainability Report , saying them .
one of the 12 participants participated in the meetings , which has declared a means of an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes case , but not financing but he met again from the to@@ bac@@ con@@ ist and Philip Morris International to come up with it .
the reasons for the selection of members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ds are not supplied , but there are several known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes setting , some of which also include an industrial funding in the paper .
a few other participants at this session are not know @-@ how to check @-@ how in tobacco products .
at the meeting also the Tab@@ ak lead of PH@@ E have also participated at the meeting .

in the attempt to enter the calendar , the former head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , is said to send the BBC , language such as East@@ on and The Voice . he said that commercial Riv@@ kin had their right arms being &quot; for hit shows such as Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast uses only should be used to make the type of programs that cannot be sent by other UK transmitter .
he cri@@ tic@@ ised the BBC enabling them to play public @-@ legal programs that will probably be seen in hard @-@ cont@@ enti@@ ous times for the most popular shows of their Riv@@ a@@ ways , such as B@@ BC@@ 4 .
after the BBC film director , Tony Hall , said that he wanted to talk to the partnership with other organizations , Johnson told that he had tried his co @-@ operation for six years in co @-@ operation with Channel 4 without success .
I have trouble with the idea that the BBC programs in the task , and broadcasts by no @-@ subsidi@@ zed bas@@ eline , &quot; he says Johnson the &quot; Communication &quot; committee on the occasion of its survey on the future of the BBC . &quot;
if you want to keep the radio formula not to keep a medium or long term , not for a good idea , you should do his production at least on programs that do not make any other or so on .
she will send the Voice in a first @-@ class setup , because she want to get a great support for their future .
the idea that even no one would display this , is a wi@@ t , it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , it is of course self @-@ wise .
Johnson , said : &quot; I do not see why it was not an reg@@ res@@ sive standards , which might be financed without subsidi@@ zation .
the Voice is a such program , East@@ on is another , considered total @-@ up measurements of both property .
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would be done to your right arms .
I ought to see if this was to be public television .
I do not believe that this would decrease the BBC as at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur on series that was managed in Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC , in the hunt for reviews , &quot; due to the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to gain long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments about the most popular programs in the BBC , that is the former head of Sky , Tony ball , gave a presentation to the end in 2003 , which shows the BBC shows how output will be selling .
Johnson told that anyone can not stand in public law @-@ programs &quot; to B@@ BC@@ 4 , but they are argu@@ ably connected to their tasks if they are argu@@ ed , &quot; Well , &quot; now , we have all these supporting programs that no one has seen . &quot;
you put them into a newspaper window , where nobody wanted to see it .
at the broadcast key , Johnson describing the Committee : &quot; I encourage you to find a rather reg@@ ression system in terms of conditions , who can it the best value .
of course , you think of every one that you have a great value for £ 150 per year here , but for people who is worth for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me whether it is true , because they do not consume too much from the BBC .
Chief David El@@ der ( former sky@@ - und Channel 5 @-@ boss David El@@ stein who also submitted to the Committee on Tuesday , called the BBC , that the BBC will try to talk to and run it . &quot;
he said , only little from the BBC production would be officially classified as education , he said that it should look at least 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio and in Canada it should change in the public television channel in Australia and Canada . &quot;
to question the partner teams , El@@ stein , the BBC talk to do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , from which he said , only a handful of television will be displayed in television , and to create the commercial transmitters of Alli@@ ances in order to make everything online .

town@@ houses for refugees , All@@ breed @-@ deser@@ ved and g@@ ing@@ ents
the real estate site Markus Gil@@ dner relies on terraced buildings for people who had not have much money .
so for people - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees do not only have been sitting area , but also the er@@ ins@@ ect mother and min@@ ing@@ ents . &quot;
as one of the trip you want to build and build it today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview
thousands of refugees are hit on the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner relies on how very expensive living space can be created : it builds on a project terraced houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are now home to the housing market .
what is your solution you do ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the measures accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people stay in a great part here .
in view of the refugees , we require a sufficiently large living room in the next decades .
a very ban@@ ker , three @-@ storey house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a row needs working in the least room .
it facilitates the integration .
this is different if one brings to people in housing blocks .
each of the six houses which are constructed in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
every apartment unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees say , it &apos;s back to peace , I am going back .
then the houses can be converted easily after the respective requirements .
how much you are the cost ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euro , without plot .
the man@@ age@@ able is man@@ age@@ able .
the building has lasted six months .
the very fair .
have the construction rules must be complicated ?
Gil@@ dner : intern@@ ship is my project right after my project .
there is particularly complicated , j@@ ol@@ ing , special structure and the set @-@ up .
consequently , N@@ gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
there will be still in a row , that creates in a row of three apartments , you need at least three plots .
in addition , there is no place in the cities .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers do not have cars .
how did the people re@@ react to their row project ?
Gil@@ dner : there was those who have accused of accused of accused of accused of reli@@ ance of Asyl@@ um .
what are not true .
but did not have the competitions of the competitions ?
Gil@@ dner : true : we had a boom in Germany in the last five years , but were built by luxury apartments that can hardly make any more satisfaction .
my project has the message , also the normal people need space .
not only refugees , but also the birth @-@ good mother or the bad @-@ deser@@ ved .
I everyone , as can I be conveniently and build today at a moment .
it &apos;s because there are about that .

it &apos;s worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged and charging your mobile phone or , in the vicinity of a charging unit , that the battery is charged .
if the cargo is too low , Apple does not show that the update is gone , because the telephone may be dis@@ connected to hal@@ ted and it could result in a decrease of the updates .

Croatia : &quot; We Are Aff@@ ing the refugees through &quot;
and now the border control are grown up on our south line , &quot; said Minister of Foreign Affairs , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel with this .
according to as , be clear that everyone who wants to make a application for asylum , &quot; could also be &quot; course . &quot;
the provision and safety of humans are used in the fore@@ ground .
it is also clear , however , that clear signals needs clear signals , &quot; said the Council of Ministers .
the people must not know that we do not accept cross @-@ border batteries , not all the Austro @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia is confi@@ dently into the corridor &quot; Cor@@ ridor . &quot; - Slovenia
the Croatian government previously reported that Slovenia would like to travel for upcoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and can host under conditions of cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
so , Minister of Foreign Minister Ves@@ na Györ@@ gy &apos;s Z@@ ni@@ dar in La@@ bach , however , did not exist .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors would be &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia would be more than enough on the monitoring of the border - primarily to Hungary .
the Chinese border with Croatia is already controlled as an external border of the Company by contrast .
as the Council of Ministers went out , Slovenia would not be locked by the borders of refugees for refugees .
as a member has , &quot; any EU member has to fill up their obligations , otherwise the system can not work , &quot; said Györ@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian Government following the government , the first refugees had already to travel through the night hours , on the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / SID in order to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police was able to use the so @-@ based corn fields .
according to the local media meeting , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , there has been quite chief of police vehicles with new refugees .
there are mainly consist of Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
both rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country with about 4,000 refugees , told the Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
also , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo , in Maz@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , who had been introducing far to the Hungarian border , led to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade are adher@@ ence to the fact that , to consult the fact that people can consult certain routes : &quot; neither cannot know , we still want to do it &quot; says . &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning , a first bus with some 50 refugees passed in the Serbian border capital of SID arrived in the course of the day , other buses are expected .
via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria in Germany
the occup@@ ants were over the whole night of the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border by Serbia .
we heard that Hungary has made a fact that Hungary has said , therefore , we had said to come back here , &quot; said one of the refugees .
they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria on to Germany .
thus it has actually been quoted on ob@@ servers already pre @-@ coming moves from the current Balkan @-@ route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further to the west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive options to control the &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously emphas@@ ised that his country has prepared a strong grid of refugees for execution of refugees to cover up possible ple@@ des .
he did not find details , he proved that Croatia is as non @-@ Sch@@ engen member &quot; included in the form of potential control . &quot;
you can now qualify for effective controls to qualify for the membership of the Sch@@ en@@ gen@@ ces .
Slovenia is on the basis since 2007 , the EU partners change their country have been a good testimony which affects the standard price controls imposed by the border control .
on Serbian site , roughly 300 refugees meet in the Hungarian Gren@@ zz@@ au@@ n continue to around 300 refugees .
according to a media reports , the last night had to spend the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border check@@ ers in Hor@@ gos and B@@ i Bre@@ g remains closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border , remains unc@@ le@@ ar .
the Serbian Minister of the Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic wanted to take on Wednesday evening with a local event , following the debates on an altern@@ ati@@ se of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for earlier .
it would currently be not to negoti@@ ate a very high number of refugees .
one could not say whether they would continue your journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ per pers for migrant workers to - dangerous and alternative rou@@ ts
however , private Hungarian refugee camps has already begun to distribute the refugees on maps , to which alternative routes are represented by Croatia .
the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , there is still not cleared mines .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of Min@@ en@@ cap@@ ers was sent to the border region .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed with Budget for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex dis@@ appoint the final results for the last quarter , and the sl@@ ate @-@ gig@@ ant cap@@ tures his target for a whole year due to the weaker demand services , and higher costs in its boat transport .
the company also said that she is planning to spend around 5@@ 5.000 rounds of seasonal workers on vacation .
at that time in the past year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to spend 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday time .
the share remained at 2.5 per cent in the pre@@ market @-@ trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between $ 40 $ and € 10,@@ 90 for the financial year , which will end in the next May , 20 cents less than that previous predic@@ tions .
analysts expected expected in to a survey of € 10,@@ 84 billion .
the lower view will occur despite the price @-@ increases , which amounts to an average of 4.9 percent and on January 4 , despite a higher kit for bo@@ oting of severe and big packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said that it acquired , expected the result compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , income and increase due to the growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company has been a solid earnings ; particularly in manufacturing and global trade , especially in manufacturing and global trade , is considered . &quot;
the plans for the holiday time was announced a day later than the last year by the Riv@@ ette UPS , the highest number of workforce , 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ ,000 had additional workforce , available for nearly the same amount as last year .
in the quarter of August , that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 spent $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
the earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42@@ $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research , was forec@@ asted .

in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex showed a decline in international Socialist shipping merchan@@ di@@ se , receiving sales in its unit Express shipping .
but the boom in the online shopping @-@ shopping @-@ shopping has significantly extended the results on F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the final quarter , sales increased by 29 percent in hot water at 29 percent , but the operative result was not with a higher cost of larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express package fell higher revenue , due to higher prices , while the operating result falling due to lower operating costs in the freight traffic .
in pre@@ market trading , about one hour before the opening , the fittings cost the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares around 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .

the card is rec@@ alled that the F@@ ed @-@ president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ en , and their colleagues is continuing the economic interests of the nation ahead of all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ time contract from the congress : a maxim@@ ise of US @-@ employment and prices here .
but since the Great recession , the F@@ ed leader have recognised the fact that it is a se@@ eded position of no financial stability : financial stability .
the third volume might be a decision in favour of a decision to cancel had predicted , that the U.S. economy is ready to declare , by an unprecedented feature set by the near @-@ term short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
while most of the economy showed that they grow sound , the most recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets are helping to strengthen the most c@@ auti@@ ous F@@ ed representative from interest to government bonds , in order to strengthen the interest rate rise from the government &apos;s bonds , in just a one @-@ quarter percentage point .
but it is evident to the labour market and inflation at primarily the most important , what they &apos;re observed , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , head of the head @-@ owned company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
but I think when searching for a pre@@ text , the interest rate was not to increase , &quot; the increased un@@ certainty of the global market is enough to wait for a global market , &quot; said it .
there is no con@@ sen@@ sus higher what the F@@ ed is to do what is un@@ insured in itself a financial market .
about half of the Econo@@ mi@@ sts who recently were inter@@ viewed by Bloomberg , have noted a rate hike this week .
however , the financial markets however are waiting a decrease in F@@ ed , a key Indian , which only has a 30 % chance at an increase .
this indicates a decrease in the stock market , if the F@@ ed is increased , it was the result that the strateg@@ ists &quot; hit the deal by helping to make the way a further increase .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial Supply should have a total of 23.@@ 28,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 5@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the campaign was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy does not disc@@ lose the sentence in this week , &quot; said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Mo@@ ody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise that the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that point , &quot; he said .
if she does it do something , &quot; you@@ thful it to go well into something called the financial markets , lest it fall into p@@ anic . &quot;
other experts are argu@@ ed that a interest @-@ level decrease the financial markets would def@@ ected since they date the dis@@ ability to remove the F@@ ed .
just a month , the F@@ ed seemed to have good way to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points to this month , the first small step in a slow disappearance of the month conditions , which would be the strength of recovery in the USA .
Y@@ els was born in the spring and early summer , in spite of the condition of liber@@ als that more economical progress should be granted in the spring of 2007 , an increase of the movements should be granted .
despite the creation of job creation in August , it is slow@@ ed down , the improvement of job market was solid in this year solid .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that catch the catch as full employment .
income increases in a recreation .
while thus , inflation was always supported under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , said the F@@ ed representative , said the main reason for the temporary effect of much lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can handle more interest rates , and it doesn &apos;t need it because of the supply voltage on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ reg@@ ain , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ ening .
but the financial markets in all over the world sent their currency in the last month after China made his currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Supply was over 16 % higher in May by more than 16 % below its top level , as investors fear@@ ed that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would thus be a global growth .
launched in this month , the market has slightly re@@ covering , whereby the Dow now is nearly 10 % below the high temperatures of May .
for the F@@ ed High School , strong turbul@@ ent in a complex calculation , when you wish to increase the interest .
if the events in financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy were not in the last few weeks , she would never put the re@@ ins . &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of U.S. Not@@ en@@ bank .
now he says that they may wait at least one month to get the impact on the grip .
there is a lot of un@@ certainty about what the impact on the US economy should be : and there are nearly no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the overall health of the world economy is one of the main approach of the F@@ ed , so they should not be moved in terms of decision @-@ proof .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of central Greece has been huge in recent years .
the naked statement of the then chief mate Ben . Bern@@ dt in 2013 that the F@@ ed increased its mon@@ ary expansion &quot; with narrow , &quot; dis@@ b@@ ations of around the world .
in a world , where the markets and economies are increasingly deployed , they may not only need to monitor the developments in other places , but also in other central banks and experts , in order to give a better understanding for the global economy .
her decision @-@ decision is &quot; more Art as science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , director of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Sti@@ er , CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . in this month , the F@@ ed observed a history of inter@@ actions on the financial market movements , which seems to be linked to the economic situation .
lacquer , voting member of the Federal Cultural Market Committee , deals with a interest @-@ rate hike , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its flagship store by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions during a limited impact on growth in the US , &quot; said he says .
a year later , the F@@ ed Representative made this ingredients all made out .
the F@@ ed should not pay upon the aspects of financial stability while heavy financial stability within the first place , in 2008 , Adam S. Poznan , a former member of the committee for the focus of the Bank of England .
the most recent turbul@@ ence are not in the vicinity of this plain , he said .
and she will surely do not walk to the situation , where she &apos;s afraid of a rate hike for the markets is exciting , &quot; said Poznan , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act is always up the double Mand@@ ate and not the financial stability , and I will not think that it would be necessary to the time of the time .

exceptions for the new Bern@@ our@@ der Sports Hall
the common ordination of Bern@@ ried appro@@ ve the construction entry for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made a exception .
the roof is allowed to become a solar system .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited s@@ wine sector on the Bern@@ rie@@ der sports area takes step by step : in the youngest joint session today , the construction was lowered without a huge pan@@ cies .
before , the team had submitted an application to the statutory provision for &quot; or &quot; liberation &quot; dated the valid construction plan .
with the exception &quot; there was the exception of a special form regarding the roof construction .
so that a &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ mi@@ zed First and roof terrace was supposed to be erected .
background of planning is the planned use of the floor space for solar installations : &quot; this makes we get a wonderful large south roof , &quot; by Mayor Josef St@@ ins@@ berger in its session .
in the &quot; liberation &quot; there was in turn around the roof pitch which prescribed for energy reasons - unlike the planning regulations , for example , under 10 degrees .
the volume of the hall will thus be significantly reduced .
therefore an &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the roof prop@@ ens@@ ity does not take to &quot; exceptions , &quot; which was to restric@@ tive to the stran@@ gling of the Community in general law .
the turn@@ hi site is , however , by no recur@@ ring project : &quot; we therefore have no preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ ins@@ berger .
the turn@@ sp@@ ends at the sports centre is a joint venture of the community and of SV Bern@@ ried .
in total , around 2.3 million euros are included .
the subsi@@ dies are expected by the school and mass sport facilities .
during the next step , the application for the 18 x 36 meter high hall is now submitted to the county office .

refugees do not need accommodations : study against housing l@@ acks
the location on the German home market is ten@@ sed .
even more refugees are looking for a paid lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing structure is in front of a challenge .
the mani@@ fold impact on the German housing market have started long since then .
with the coming refugees and demoli@@ tion of the EU , more people cra@@ cking out to a market that is already over@@ la@@ zed in many large cities .
in order to compete with a low @-@ weak citizens , the last paid apartments were united with .
in order to cover the demand for paid flats , would have expected to be 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 .
a study on behalf of the Association Council &quot; Social er Co@@ bau &quot; is on behalf of this outcome .
by comparison , the number of units in Germany is fin@@ alized in Germany per year .
in total , 14@@ 0.000 apartments could be missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are not obliged to live as an asylum seek@@ ers in a recording stay .
many more people live on the housing market , and in the long be@@ aks in front of the rental flats .
according to the Statisti@@ cal Office in the last year however , less than half of the concerned rules to rent .
however the negative development of the residential market however is not only at the rising refugee camp .
the study also makes significant impact energy in the housing market policy of the last years .
Germany sle@@ dges an residential deficit in Germany , which will be larger than year .
currently about 77@@ ,000 units of residential units , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
in addition , many professional experience , therefore , in large @-@ capacity cities , are working in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ voluntarily in the &quot; Hotel M@@ ama , &quot; because of the fle@@ a in the housing market .
in large cities , there was the number of square meters per head in the past years , and in the past few years .
in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social er Co@@ bau &quot; was initiated .
a new inc@@ enti@@ ves will rise to the social housing the social housing of the social housing .
thus on the € 150,000 clients , ab@@ ail can be constructed and will be exposed to the ground rate for sponsored p@@ ents .
in addition , the alliance , attractive and amor@@ tis@@ ation options have been necessary .
the feed program for the refugees to the state bank Kf@@ W comes well ahead in cities and municipalities already now .
a good week after start was on Monday evening with 184 million euros , by more than half of the already available 300 million Euros .
now , the project could even be increased .
refugees have free care : Croatia and Slovenia are secured by Cor@@ ridor .
after Hungary , practically no longer pass through Hungary , as the reason for more refugees meet the road to Croatia .
in Zagreb , Austria announces a journey through Slovenia in Greece without any hur@@ dle .
however , this is still dangerous .
Croatia is participating in the neighbouring land of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
as &quot; I said , &quot; I have spoken by Sloven@@ ian Minister of State , and if it is necessary to organise a cor@@ rid@@ ors , &quot; said Croatian Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Sch@@ engen area .
the EU country Croatia is not yet no Sch@@ engen country .
after the off @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees travels to Croatia in order to reach Western Europe from there .
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , as the Croatian TV channel RTL group .
last day , Hungary had shut off his border for refugees .
the new laws that came into force on the same day make an ordinary le@@ asylum request in Hungary .
Croatia is able to pass the refugees .
the Croatian Prime Minister , Zoran Mil@@ an@@ ovic , said : &quot; you can travel and we prepare for the possibility . &quot;
these people are there , women , children and men who live and want to reach .
however , people who had@@ n &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police arrested some refugees on the border of Serbia into the EU &apos;s neighbouring countries of Croatia .
most of the media reports from Syria , Iran , and Afghanistan .
you came home with the bus and also with tax@@ ation in the Serbian border city of SID .
immediately after her arrival , it tries to reach the green border to Croatia on foot .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees cannot prove the refugees on Gren@@ zen@@ une .
while the border combined with other dan@@ gers are port@@ ed , there are sharp Min@@ es from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
the Min@@ en@@ cap@@ er should now create a secure passage in the future .
after Hungary , descent to Hungary is nearly all refugees in the closing of the border .
on Tuesday , the police arrested 3@@ 66 .
shortly before the deadline on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .

in the south@@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 penalty were successfully launched .
the prison thre@@ es of up to five years and the deportation is coming from the country .
according to the immigration authority , one received a total of 94 asylum seek@@ ers in the newly formed part of the &quot; Tran@@ sition Coun@@ tries &quot; of nearly all - 93 - the most important transition between R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
the applic@@ ant are 13 families with young children and two older people .
on Wednesday evening , 40 refugees were stopped in the Wednesday night .
however , nobody has any more views in Hungary and granted asylum in Hungary .
after ung@@ ar@@ ischer , Serbia is a &quot; safe @-@ country &quot; project .
the previous asylum seek@@ ers should be operated there .
only few hundred migrants in front of the &quot; Transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , a few hundred migrants have met .
all in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke started to clear up workers in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they gathered together the mu@@ ff , which left the tens of thousands of people in the past weeks .
in addition , a lat@@ tice is mounted and one of the coat of shelves in the fron@@ tier .
and nobody wanted to express him something .
Austria reach after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary only a few refugees .
the country has , in addition , its border control are established .
in about 20.000 migrants will considered , in the country , but in the country .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the programming trip to Germany .
the railway traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at a statement by German authorities .
in Freil@@ assing , we met regularly for small groups of refugees on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the border
in 1994 we went back to a weigh@@ ted party on Sunday with the rooms , when suddenly , ten people with travel off@@ ended at the entrance of the Zel@@ ah , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ st@@ one mayor Alois Stad@@ ler .
other visitors , they wanted to be by train to Passau .
because Germany was surprisingly brought to the train with Austria because of a refugee and to mar@@ ry the railway traffic in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; said then he offered his assistance and the troub@@ led together with two more hel@@ pers , and their cars across the border to Nah@@ e Passau .
we previously tested the un@@ valued guests at once , with J@@ ause and beverages .
we have said to them , we bring them to the car in Passau .
&quot; this was of course , &quot; as a city in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview .
we were very thank@@ ful .
a man could not take it to hand over a generous don@@ or - 100 Euro for the fire@@ fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was very pleased to announce that &quot; &quot; &quot;
the train , while trying to transport the train , on Sunday evening , from a ICE in the regional train , reached Passau , in order to pursue after the termination of the contract , the railway traffic in Germany was renamed to Germany , but still trying to try the border .
the regional train was completed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein , Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border @-@ border is generally highly regarded in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian State of Russia gave on Sunday before a two @-@ track in sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria in Neu@@ kirchen .
the Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends further Z@@ ig@@ y of us , and is a logical result of a holy policy :
instead of the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp , in order to ensure the integration of structures , our news agency has officially put forward for the position of Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ circle of National@@ socialism .
the policy of this policy are not just the Austri@@ ans that are now confronted with chao@@ tic stress .
even the flo@@ wery dates must be established , that the &quot; gel@@ ob@@ te Land , &quot; which she was invited to welcome and welcome nothing as a further refugee camp .
it will be a major challenge , in view of the sustained @-@ stream flows and the removal of winter , decent co@@ g@@ ings for protective suits .
and there will be a bigger group bigger - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad , searching for an exhibition of 3@@ 5.000 people infected Qu@@ arti@@ ers
Konrad has to do all hands fully with the refugee camps .
Christian Konrad is it to know that his word is weight .
the government has used the previous M@@ et @-@ Ban@@ ker to put a qu@@ arti@@ ere for the people of thousands .
the Chaos in the first operative town of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen will already have its handle in the handle .
we don &apos;t have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported on his first success .
while the cost of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday in the Monday , he was without great things , Konrad , and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; Meister@@ performance &quot; . &quot;
the interior of the Interior , however , on the other hand , of a &quot; k@@ is@@ able situation . &quot;
all in all , Konrad , with global demand of 8@@ 5,000 Qu@@ arti@@ ce per year .
to accomplish the number , customers must deliver approximately 35@@ ,000 accommodations in the next weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
should we need more than 100 refugees , we can create .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this is no wet or ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad Adenauer , &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the state capital , he has already led him with the highlights .
they could not have to secured themselves , even for the next refugees Qu@@ arti@@ s .
&quot; in Upper Austria it runs well , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar doesn &apos;t support Konrad .
tomorrow , a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , intended to clari@@ fy how the church will help .
great expectations the right coordination is the right sport co @-@ ordin@@ ator &quot; Hel@@ ka as we . &quot;
on the platform , private persons can offer un@@ complicated mounting .
in addition , hopes are put at hotels , which stand in the winter .
in 1994 , Konrad Wolf and Mai@@ er cri@@ tic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in Not@@ ation times , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ am@@ pler is able to hold a certain height of the towels or size of the upper hand .
they would have to apply to &quot; Not@@ ation Camp &quot; in the short @-@ term time .
that he is in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , in the middle of the ministry , he is Konrad to its experience .
I am an older brother , who don &apos;t ever say without any other face to face .
with the powers of persu@@ ader is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er cause the Republic not cause a cost of how they declared itself .
they want to increase their number of staff at 3 to four .
the own qu@@ antum search was not yet successfully for the first time .
Konrad wanted to install a container in the Steph@@ an@@ splatz in the office .
however there are clearly flaws with the approval .
Linz is for a better partition
pre @-@ opening of urban sports halls and other building like tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to the lodging of refugees visit the city of Linz .
this may be not necessary as one may only issue the person affected without these measures , says the Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for the emergency exchange , however , other sites are to be tested for exchange rates .
criticism of the municipal authorities at the breakdown of the refugees in the country .
and other districts have to make a contribution to this .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; limitations are non @-@ sealed . &quot;
in a longer telephone conference with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ president Josef P@@ ah@@ inger ( VP ) , who was other jo@@ in@@ ded in the refugee camp .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has given me that the German borders were not be sealed .
the further journey of refugees in the Federal Republic may continue to be possible .
but the relevant border control are in the course of the relevant border control .
first excer@@ pts of refugees to Germany will not give it any more .
the protective suits would be brought out to Germany with regular moves to Germany .
from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger demanded more greater solidarity in the refugees worldwide .
in consequence , Austria began to take part in its borders , &quot; is a logical consequence of &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the fore@@ going of the Germans .
the next r@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
the general reconstruction of the &quot; New shipy@@ ard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial branch was officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the IT company S &amp; T was drawn up , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is to be rented for young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
at IT , the ast@@ wise heads of our raw material - and we need to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T Group Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could also imagine the start @-@ up companies of the New shipy@@ ard to invest in the start @-@ up companies and later .
already from the start , S &amp; T already aims to cooperate with the new neigh@@ bor - including the time promised : &quot; the next r@@ unt@@ astic &quot; is merely a matter of time . &quot;
an investment of 1.7 million euros was invested in the new , 3.3 million euro by tech@@ c@@ En@@ ter , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , Austria &apos;s Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is designed by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as tech@@ c@@ En@@ ter .
an additional 30 per cent of the 2700 square meters in the building are already booked for an additional 40 per cent of the app@@ ellation .

in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop , in front of the business , where them sells bags , bags , shoes and plum@@ bers of various manufacturers , all of which everything is around Dam@@ de @-@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , money stock exchange rates from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks later .
but &quot; I &apos;ve got very long , however , whether I must open a shop , &quot; says Bre@@ ite .
decisive for the decision was , among other things , that Fur@@ la @-@ producer , who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of an own site , where only her hand@@ bags were sold to .
&quot; we are the only in the greater area of Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who has even Italian roots .
your fashion @-@ interest has been re @-@ made by her mother in the cra@@ dle .
at most , I am going to work with something and I can show new trends .
why should some woman bound to a beautiful Hand@@ bag with a return device , the conc@@ ub@@ ine could not answer the same safety , too .
maybe it is resp@@ ec@@ tioned that a beautiful bag will design every output of every output .
the Br@@ ull@@ ha@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place to be called an employee .
this property is also supported by the millions of people who want to become US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always easy for excitement .
whether he became foreign @-@ tra@@ dic@@ ally , journalists male , or knowledge g@@ aps have revealed in international crisis policy : the candidates for the US presidential back in s@@ wir@@ ling for election campaign .
and cutting off at the same time .
this is also registered in the older K@@ all@@ stadt @-@ city , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate spanning several years .
the New York artist with the departure of New York is a name for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road .
man@@ ned in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village is related over -@@ zig , with him related to him .
his grandfather was founded in K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pfalz - Donald Tru@@ mp , here in campaign mode .
the work of Simone Wen@@ del sp@@ un turned into a film about Tru@@ mp .
what should the inhabitants of the town are not to be the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I believe that &quot; somehow exciting , &quot; however , &quot; I believe , too , are very impressed indeed in the town of c@@ all@@ stadt , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ ut , an am@@ using documentary about the location and his famous sp@@ ouses , to which Tru@@ mp can also be seen the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
so Tru@@ mp , who is not known for notification - comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to word - so with the testimony that he would certainly have been successful when he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
by the king of the hearts , he has not brought it there .
although it &apos;s possible to get in front of the performance of the family , but ten@@ ds to say that Tru@@ mp , &quot; would be a bit of big m@@ aul &quot; ( says Wen@@ del . &quot;
random name , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within the radius of &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ ha@@ es@@ macher , &quot; says to Franco @-@ German : the accused of def@@ endants .
so , Tru@@ mp can therefore come from the village of def@@ endants .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story started in 1885 when the later grandfather fought back and found a locality for Gold@@ dig@@ card in the USA .
the foundation of the real estate group were the first company sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents had not been free of trage@@ dy : your wish , to return to the border , failed in the Bavarian state , at the end of the Pfalz in that same year .
he was not included to Tru@@ mp , for He once saved without permission , and he was Director of the Institut für Pf@@ al@@ z@@ ische History and Ethno@@ graphy , Roland Paul , as a film start .
Tru@@ mp was the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal im@@ migrant . &quot;
in contrast to the regions , however , this contrast is in contrast with certain statements about the desc@@ endant .
this was repeated to the United States in the United States and requested the construction of a limit for illegal im@@ migrant or the construction of a border .
so as the polar , not so sympath@@ y , &quot; Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote transformation of Tru@@ mps ( &quot; the O@@ ma , was a son of Tru@@ mp , and the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
as of retirement , the Americans now sees all of it , &quot; he is always so un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted . &quot;
what is what Tru@@ mp is coming ?
that &quot; the 72 @-@ year @-@ old could not present myself , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he never take care about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pend@@ ul@@ tin Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm is mentioned as a desire of K@@ all@@ ye , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz felt a visit for the church scra@@ pers , which finally arrived there .
that &quot; the 68 @-@ year @-@ old could not present myself with the Donald &apos;s . &quot;
you get better , if you don &apos;t get there , because &quot; the much of the radical views , I do not know whether it is good . &quot;
if those who had settled at the time of his grandfather in the US , would have been in the US as he would never arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more detailed topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ a Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as President ?
&quot; my President is not &quot; my President , &quot; says she .
and only &quot; the grapes are mature automatically without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
at the time he was inter@@ viewed for the Tru@@ mp movie , some 12 000 pictures were seen , also in the USA , and eight very interested in the USA .
the Bavarian Municipality of Ram@@ sau in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain@@ eering village . &quot;
after the first Vice President of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enn@@ ing , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village was held in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den Park , on Wednesday to enjoy the tourist bid .

one &quot; mountain@@ eering school &quot; must have at most 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its area has to be published as a protected area .

Today it had a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 33@@ ,000 ) , but their number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ ,000 ) .
while over the last months , Today it has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise .
in August , Today it reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise .

this is the most interesting one that happens every morning .
the construction of the wall is related to this little more than the parliament !

however , if the question is turned , &quot; When you know , the Woods Officer must get involved ? &quot; though her answers to the game should perish , who won the heart of the Bach .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki quickly , both soon - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner in Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood did not have any one of the first day to connect each other .
from the moment when I went to the house and ( sar@@ ah ) and Sam@@ ples of 1923 , I noticed that they were very compatible , and I needed it to make @-@ fel@@ lows throughout the course of the show , &quot; she told Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ fel@@ lows .
Sarah has been with your feet on the earth , making it a lot of fun together with her , &quot; said Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
you are comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam &apos;s may be a good pair .
from her perspective , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house for the next week had made their clear that Wood &apos;s &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and the family , it was clear that this is obviously not only a game - I am now subject to him , &quot; said it .
and when they asked for them , wh@@ ome@@ Wood will be offering to it , when they didn &apos;t take it .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say , &quot; she said .

&quot; this was a thing that occurs now , it is only about the next game , and this is it &quot; said Hay@@ ne .

for slightly larger diabe@@ tic patients , weight loss can be helpful .
the advantages of weight loss medication for easy @-@ to @-@ intensive people with type 2 diabetes can last according to a new study at least five years .
it is still early to tell that , if easy to bear important people with diabetes progression more than those who do not receive surgery treatment .
the mortality rate in the long time need a longer time to show a something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Win@@ stone , an expert in weight loss @-@ surgery , who wrote a key contribution to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss of weight or adi@@ posit@@ as @-@ surgery , use different methods to cross the size of magic .
reduce hunger and limits the body &apos;s own ability to record food .
over the years , obes@@ ity has proved treatment for type 2 diabetes as a efficient , but most studies were performed in people who are highly resistant with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain high level of weight in terms of size , applies as normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more , that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a BMI over 30 are considered as low @-@ fat .
you can calculate here your BMI : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital , which has been present in a study and compare the two types of adi@@ posit@@ as Sur@@ gery - mag@@ enb@@ elt and Mag@@ en@@ schl@@ ager - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes and people who were slightly higher .
the average BMI of those who are subjected to this operation , decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 from the end of the fifth year .
meanwhile , the BMI in those who did not treatment surgical treatment were approximately equal to 29 patients .
among those who underwent surgical procedure , he dis@@ b@@ anded , between 36 % of the diabetes disease , and fell by 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally speaking group , the patients was tied with sales by only one percent , with only around two percent .
in addition , the results were found in controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the poor &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; in general and better in the &quot; surgical intervention &quot; group . &quot;
the researchers continue during the patient @-@ level em@@ ulation of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar in the course of the time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is given the best among 7 percent of the researchers , then the researchers .
according to the surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in was lowered by around 9 per cent of level to around 6 per cent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ce@@ mic control &quot; - as they lead in improved m@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - reduced the risk of mortality in five years , the leading scientists Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team would also ob@@ serves as average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the B@@ ypass Sur@@ gery @-@ Group increased its weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 4 kg ) , resulting in the lower ( 4@@ 8.4 % vs. 5.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming over@@ coming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16,@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study no survival benefit of surgery administered after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says the stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was low for obes@@ ity people who underwent an adi@@ posit@@ as operation , 29 per cent less than in the course of 15 years - compared to a group , which sought to hold a conventional approach .
while the new study doesn &apos;t have the benefit of survival in Sur@@ gery @-@ patients : &quot; Black@@ stone , who was not interested in people with a BMI of 35 , who are interested in the procedure .
the critical point of this study , because she says that operation in this lower BMI is lower , &quot; but without the risk of death or a kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone then added that people and their doctors have to start to take weight , as soon as the patient with its BMI is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think that we wait for a long time , before we bring to God , &quot; said it .
I think that once they have collected this genetic changes have been collected that have associated their body with obes@@ ity and diabetes m@@ ist , is a revers@@ ing really difficult . &quot;

it is impossible to know that every one comes from Europe ! - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
a Europe could not go all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and , added that the real solution of the refugee from the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddhist leader leaders called on to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama proposed the problem of the ongoing refugee camp at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford in favor of his eth@@ ics organizations .
he requested that , under the given conditions , the interests of individual nations and even greater numbers should be made , under the given conditions .
he also emphasized that the reaction of Western European countries could be admired , but the situation cannot be adequ@@ ately stated .
&quot; it is impossible , everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
nom@@ ination of the Dalai Lama in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to sing the crisis , he emphas@@ ised that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; in order to take several thousand refugees to take care of , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions to think as a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , which can be created for these Muslim countries . &quot;
that , we must think of it , just reduce the murder in their countries .
we have to reduce the use of violence .
the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he explained .
the Dalai Lama proposed the problem of violence and commented on George Bus@@ h@@ s work after the terrorist attack of September 11 , 2013 , that the non @-@ profit reaction in the US had a chain of un@@ controlled events .
after September 11 , I explained my sor@@ row in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to solve this problem is in non @-@ violence .
&quot; I know his motifs were good , but he managed violence , and this has no unexpected consequences . &quot; &quot; he says the Dalai Lama .
quad increase of Hand @-@ disinf@@ ection products with children in the last 4 years
the remote control centres across the United States have a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , with strongly drinking @-@ disinf@@ ection , such that Georgia &apos;s bar@@ ison Center .

he said that some children of disinf@@ ect@@ ant is required to drink during a few days to print their friends or for a trial with the social media .
videos on YouTube display , such as young disinf@@ ect@@ ant , only due to a cheap moments .
you@@ ths work as a disinf@@ ect@@ ant with soft hair loss , in order to get a harder drink .
younger children can be accused of attractive no@@ zzles of the disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child in things do not think that this will bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who have to feed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ant with stra@@ w@@ berries , grape and orange juice , which are attractive for children .
hand@@ shake of disinf@@ ection products contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially for small children , only few hose can already run on alcohol poison@@ ing .
it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ val@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ ation centre at the University of Kan@@ sas , the transmitter Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City .
so , you would not leave for all over Whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant in the reach of children , and if children come upon it , then it is a fast way to consume up alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six year old girl who had taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from the earthquake des@@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , had taken place a banknote for the treatment .
their blood flow in blood was 179 , twice higher than the threshold which was concerned over adults , said Dr. Chris R@@ itch@@ ey , a not@@ ary degree , who was covered at the G@@ win@@ ey@@ Medical Center in Alt@@ anta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah took her words and wasn &apos;t able to stop when she was rolling in the area .

&quot; this was very fear@@ ful , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Illinois , N@@ ha@@ i@@ @-@ &apos;s mother , CNN .
if my child could have a fatal risk .
Lop@@ ez has parents and teachers recommend to use soft products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants from non @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant , outside the child &apos;s reach .

the former lea@@ derboard team fiel@@ der and the Swiss National Team Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost their interest in Cel@@ tic , because there is no title @-@ ri@@ val@@ ry with the lea@@ derboard .
de Bo@@ er , currently a ambassador to Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they had no highlight of the Cel@@ tic games , and why ? &quot;
it is because the lea@@ derboard is not there .
people stayed here not only about the return of the lea@@ derboard .
you &apos;re talking about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams , and this is what they are interested .
there &apos;s a lot of voltage for the Old Age games , and it &apos;s not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will bring the things to spin , swe@@ ars D@@ eil@@ a .
Ron@@ ny D@@ eil@@ a accepted that Cel@@ tic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss had to spin around Him .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent data from the Champions League , the defeat against ten men was followed by Aber@@ deen , who are now followed by five points now clearly at the top of the table .
but D@@ eil@@ a said , &quot; Cel@@ tic had already bad days before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come as fast as possible .
I know , it is very fru@@ str@@ ated and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened .
we will feel exactly as that - but we need to continue .
we really need to truly the support of Cel@@ tic , because that players make better .
it is to be said to be so important .

sometimes more damage will be executed because you need to add the necessary Player to the need , what you really need .

Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate for 5.@@ 9 percent had been above the level of the UK@@ E of 5.5 per cent , as the figures of the National Statisti@@ cs ( ON@@ S ) showed .

in these 12 months , we have experienced improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase of employment and a decrease in unemployment .

why I &apos;ve witnessed the execution of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma &apos;s execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma .
a bit later , in the case of a late legal intervention , I will likely be to death like a man .
if it happens , and I hope that there is no time to sit in an Audi@@ ence Gallery at the death of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is supplied by the de@@ an in@@ fusion .
he has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses for his death .
this invitation was first mentioned in January by his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked to give me .
when the day was closer and closer , I began to fear me .
so why should I do it ?
I voted in favor of what I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about death penalty .
there would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists visits to the USA will see , and there are often more applications as places available in the USA , a ma@@ sts lot@@ tery will take place in order to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media pitches from 12 to five .
anyone who wants to observe a emo@@ de watch .
I cannot believe that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps in a durable friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship with telephone directories and a two and a half hours .
I like the Ker@@ l .
we really often say good when we &apos;re talking about .
the prison term could say that I have not a witness , and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to use a not@@ ebook , plus a paper @-@ to @-@ use what I see what I will see .
I must just attempt to remember to all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma calls me on Twitter , my crimes .
the lesson .
let the story of the prisoner , how he wants to get and you will get access .
I describe these values at you .
they ruled that they &quot; could have it even better , &quot; but they think that it &apos;s going wrong , what I do them : do them :
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p has trouble with some of the things which I said , and wrote .
he says to me , what I have left , and I would not do it if he would do it .
I said to him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses all at any time .
but he want to write an international re@@ porter there , in order to write there .
when he dies , he explains that the public relation to the movement will help against death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter in Hu@@ chen@@ ington Post , will be sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please take the series of Pod@@ cast@@ s that I have made .
I will not again go to all the details again .
I cannot believe not with the fact that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is ple@@ aded not guilty .
his actions after the assassination of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would not be found him to be a wealth in the environment .
but I believe that a high lik@@ eness is that it is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is no sufficient to jus@@ tify the cause of death .
I believe that its execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will die as die .
I couldn &apos;t claim an object to be truly able .
there will be other re@@ por@@ ters to apply to what you can contact for it .
what you will get from me , what makes it possible to see an unexpected death on the way .

Peter Mo@@ ody claimed that Ste@@ wards tried to leave him to play him and threatened him to finish the racing sports
Peter Mo@@ ody claimed that Ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria will have tried to install a sp@@ on in his steps back to the end of last year and threatened to finish the race .
he is based on the ste@@ wards and the integration department of Racing Victoria and held that she held a personal campaign against him with the late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching off Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment on Wednesday , the last stro@@ hal@@ ted on Wednesday , July .
Mo@@ ody said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what he really struggl@@ ed to do with the best for racing and in difficult conditions , as it was in order to explain the positive cobalt @-@ T@@ up@@ fer@@ ner sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot declare that .
he had returned 18 months for the sp@@ ying of the spi@@ kes , and didn &apos;t want to see that it seems to be high @-@ quality grapes . &quot;
I said , nothing said to say anything , and I have spent long on telling me , but sometimes they &apos;re so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything goes out in once , &quot; said Mo@@ ody .
you know that it is far .
sometimes , we had to re@@ acts with the consequences , and I must live what I said .
I &apos;ll do last night to go home and sleep well in the evening .
I would like to go to the head , and I want to think that my owner , that I think my best for them .
if you start to think , I do not see them , then I should not have more trainer .
I have to think of what I needed to get with my license .
previously , Mo@@ ody &apos;ve just decre@@ ed the bom@@ bs in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the control Department had been trying to have its stable in the stable .
as early as eigh@@ teen months , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with my husband whom I would like to deliver to my stu@@ pe@@ eling in order to deliver information about what I do in my st@@ ables , &quot; said Mo@@ ody to Rac@@ ing@@ .com .

if that is the case , they should definitely write to their n@@ oses , since they were em@@ ulate in the attempt to send me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ old . Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Mo@@ odie , official Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ as , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were down repeatedly at the time and today it is still in existence today .
should I understand that it is personally responsible ?
has the R@@ V@@ L hon@@ ours be@@ have and , perhaps people outside of train@@ ers are responsible for what is going in the industry ?
I &apos;m bad for the sector ?
I am working so much for the sector ?
we think the people are outside , that I am it .
maybe you have to take my license and cast me away ; and I don &apos;t understand that I say to you , she is now thinking about it .
but I am now arrived on the spot in which no matter is finished , and that just sad about it .
this means me we are still sad .
I &apos;ll bring the pressure on them , and to force a decision to make a decision .
I have support from my family and I can go .
as part of the train@@ ers , the fruit branch of the trainer has a long @-@ standing mixture in Li@@ dar@@ i and , and the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching off that he could not be able to hold a license to the table . &quot;
Mo@@ ody , best known for its master crafts@@ man , Black C@@ avi@@ ar , had called the racing treatment instructions , &quot; after a packing mud or sound had been carried out to the horse level , what should be carried out against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing sports . &quot;
, I must take care of the full responsibility , &quot; he said .
the castle of one of my staff , ir@@ r@@ k@@ m@@ ble Schl@@ ge have applied to the B@@ ein .
there would have been so successful last night .
I have got so far the whole day so that even so .
it didn &apos;t know it so on the racing day .
today , Mo@@ ody could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an inqu@@ iry was opened .
it is a watch .
people who constitute this rules , don &apos;t know anything about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need to run the rules , but here we go too far , &quot; said Mo@@ ody .

Sydney Ro@@ stak@@ ers Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson told you that the arbit@@ rat@@ ors are making their final Storm with their team during the High Storm Cup Final in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ ces Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a hard re@@ ed note from the Storm Cup , after his team had achieved the final example of the Ru@@ g@@ by League , and said that the two consists of Queensland is not &quot; too well &quot; in the R@@ ingen .
Bell@@ otti defended his team in his team and said that she had only focused her on contact with T@@ ack@@ ling .
Bell@@ agio also added that the criticism of two leading students at his team are confident that there was wor@@ ries that they made their wor@@ ries from the Storm @-@ Team .
the year again , I &apos;ve been there again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about a ring@@ es when she was beaten up for us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ walks on Wednesday .
in the last six weeks we have not been able to have changed our potential @-@ based system or techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with T@@ ack@@ les in a real emphasis on us , and which resulted in a great turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has now been there for three years , and he has obviously a great team to train . he is therefore probably not able to get acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to , so it was a bit a blow for him .
it is un@@ compressed there , as it appears again in the season of the year again .
Bell@@ agio has attacked her idea of an exciting football title with his ment@@ or and reminds me that Benn@@ ett and George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Drag@@ ons had won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; slow @-@ day football . &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of an exciting football .
he went on his play on Saturday night with our Friday evening , and as exciting her game , &quot; said Bell@@ otti .
I recall that , in 2010 , St George went for a long @-@ piece team , and Way@@ ne said that he would not take a di@@ vor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play with and which we watch as exciting , especially for young people with their speed .
that &apos;s the ball game , which you want to play , when you player this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play that all of his art of football - not each team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , so they can play as these games .
I use stronger confidence in because they say to those things because they &apos;re a bit un@@ done to play against us .
they did not have something to us , when it went to the big Games before six weeks ago .
Bell@@ agio finally pointed out that the game made against Ro@@ okie &apos;s Game against Ro@@ okie &apos;s match against C@@ ow@@ ers .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game I &apos;ve never seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more experiments in our game but is that an exciting game ?
or you will make and have any points something lighter ?
the game tables are tables for me .
once they make us mention , it means that we will continue to meet it in one phase .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of the cell are deser@@ ted ;
the Federal Constitutional Court appointed a former det@@ ain@@ ee of the judicial right bank Te@@ gel right , the months of which was housed in a small cell .
because of the violation of human dignity , prisoners did not claim in a financial compensation if they were in to small cells .
this has decided the Federal Constitutional Court in one on Wednesday &apos;s decision .
according to the people , the subject can be searched for once only a few days were imprisoned in the close rooms ( A@@ z . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
with his Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe , a former det@@ ain@@ ee was successful with the judicial field of Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 , with a land area of around five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was not separated from that .
afterwards , the man , who has now been moved upwards on grounds of its ma@@ iden , has now been moved to a greater cell in operation .
his authority in@@ ad@@ in@@ ance due to the irrit@@ ability of living conditions against the land of Berlin was observed .
however , the Constitutional Court confirmed the verdict of the Chamber of Berlin and presented the case for the renewed check @-@ in tests .
you are seeing the person &apos;s person , who was not viol@@ ated .
aqueous hum@@ or in 2012 now suspended over the amount of the compensation
if , of legal reasons , only a few days of imprisonment for the compensation have to be significantly , the equ@@ ation was to the same day .
otherwise you would have to fear in the legal protection of the personality . &quot;
the chamber construction now has to clari@@ fy the height of the dent@@ ine .
the judges we have reinforced the rights of those arrested in the past .
they said they only were one of the in@@ mate of poll@@ ut@@ ant at the end of April because he was j@@ ailed straight to a cell .
human un@@ worthy is a decision taken in 2011 to ensure the majority of the cell without a separate toilet .
additionally , on Wednesday , in addition , the Federal Constitutional Court on Wednesday that a prisoner reporting an parallel in the parallel event in November 2009 had in@@ worth@@ while accommodation .
the then owner was over three months , between 15 and 21 hours and , in a similar cell like Charles Bridge .
the Berlin en@@ ot came down in the head@@ lines in the last weeks , because of missing people .
it is therefore always revealed , too , for 23 hours , w@@ aging the aggres@@ si@@ vity would have just come to beats me , because of the ten@@ se we have come to .
according to information of the judicial authorities , 21 places were not occupied in te@@ St due to young men , 19 should fall off at the end of 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration concerning refugees is a tremendous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ellor is decided to accept them .
what comes in Germany ?
according to the projections of the Federal Ministry of Finance in that year , approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are coming to Germany , in the statement of Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to record a million refugees in Germany .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrate in light of the unusual challenge , &quot; I tell again and again : &quot; I say , &quot; we are using this . &quot;
what is in Germany , the following overview .
according to their projections , there are a total of 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ating as the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as so far ( 250 000 apartments ) .
the lack of price is pit@@ ched to the lack of living space and an extra @-@ paid rentals . 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social houses are out of the rental price , and these are especially suitable for refugees in particular .
the Federal Minister of State Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) , who wants to double to double , is currently EUR 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
this is much too little is the view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social houses , which would have to invest some 6.4 billion a year in terms of the federal government funding per year .
detailed scientists and Federal Minister of State in it is that there are also more advantages to investment in the housing structure .
according to the Institute for Employment Research Series and the Voc@@ ational Research Institute , it is likely to pick up 55 percent of the competitors arriving in Germany .
however , the refugees in Germany cannot fail not succeed in their qualification to help them , and cri@@ tici@@ zed by Claudia , the project manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
for the integration of refugees , however , key to whether they can do in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for the appreciation you in the film @-@ meg@@ company , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the Zu@@ wanderer aries , says Mig@@ r@@ ational researchers G@@ Thr@@ u@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ hardt , Secretary of France , Robertson Smith was admitted to the work for refugees to the recognition of work .
while it was no work to be left for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence of the asylum seek@@ ers .
also in the company - even due to the strength of strength , the majority of the visibility you decide to hit future access to the job market .
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is missing .
so far there is not no sufficient offer to generally and in @-@ related language courses .
some studies show that jobs are the most frequently use with personal contacts .
the structure of network is therefore considered to be a view of Thr@@ hardt in the shape of the work@@ piece .
the Berlin Administration has found that only few poultry lost their children into the Kit@@ ron , it is estimated at least ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the dra@@ ined parents it is not important to summ@@ ari@@ ze the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Comp@@ ati@@ ble , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate .
nevertheless the advantages of the K@@ ita , can convince the advantages of your family in various languages .
if the need for women lies in the huge number of refugees had strongly rising up , the Berlin Senate tried to raise the training capacities - by increasing the interest schools .
all German students with welcome categories will be prepared for lessons in the countries .
they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but also , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who have a qualification in German as a second language .
no lack of activity consists of a lack , &quot; Be@@ ate St@@ lights from the Berlin school administration .
the German Student Union estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees are to study in Germany .
in principle , no Federal Minister of Asyl@@ um or Ged@@ ul@@ gained the course - the only exception came to Berlin , Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CDU ) already en@@ ish its position .
studies of conventional refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
since refugees with a point of stay or Dul@@ ce do not have any services after the applicants , when they opened a study .
latter , in principle , no evil figur@@ ator , since they are not falling below the circle of local extinc@@ tion .
patient refugees had to be lived four years in Germany in order to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , until the 1st of January 2016 , fell over a reduced length of 15 months .
but this financing has to be closed , however , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Student Union .
the students should get B@@ af@@ ö@@ e in immediate vicinity .
Islam is in future to play a more important role , because many people are Muslim , and many of them are the religion demands of their identity .
and in Islam , the state should cover succ@@ essively the same rights as they said the churches , and the existing state of churches must continue to develop a new state of religion .
this is important also the foundation of a Islamic navigation association who car@@ es professional preparations for the new ank@@ ers .
even the right hand is a part of the rights .
thus , the representative of Islam have to be to clean contact persons some and are ready to work with the state in many areas , as well as certain control options .
this is also an account of the willingness to walk up against religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims who Aim@@ ing Ma@@ oc@@ ek , released on Thursday the worry , religious conflicts could also become batt@@ led after Germany .
those who wished to have such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately got her right to stay here in Germany , &quot; said he wrote in the Bavarian radio .
he smote the Basic Law about arab@@ ic because he was liber@@ ated .
in the future , much more will be on the topic of the company today .
as its majority , the majority of shares will continue to modify the degra@@ dation of discrimination and rac@@ ism .
Germany - as a result of European cho@@ ices - since last decade , an anti @-@ discrimination clause is a General Act .
but it was too slow to compete with the NSU @-@ M@@ ord@@ al Series , in the police , the ra@@ ci@@ ally liber@@ ated the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what civil society groups and groups of interest in white countries have fallen into themselves as long as the anti @-@ ra@@ cial acy in Germany . it must be reality in the next few years , if the land will rest peaceful and citizens can benefit your ways - the well@@ being of all .
in general , Germany is able to support medical projects to date of the previously expected persons , medical president Frank Paul Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
that concerned Man@@ - Power and capacities , we make the &quot; I said the one level of view .
however , the extra money was to flow into the system .
in order to avoid a bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all di@@ mmers offer to normal health cards .
the same services , Bosch could be settled by the Federal states in later .
and long term , it was highly un@@ question@@ able that many people agree with a limited performance catalog as many of whom he agree the asylum seek@@ ers .
otherwise , the doctors said to create all the opponents in order to create .
so far , the scientists of the Scienti@@ st , and Soci@@ a Bor@@ de has been proven to research , resulting in no worse than other diseases , referred to by other diseases .
not only in clinics , also in medical practices , must also be accepted in medical practices .
also , many refugees had been helped with more ever @-@ medical offices in the emergency out@@ patient .
and with another diagnostic view .
amongst them there are about 10 more untreated disability , and for the young people go to HIV prevention .
with some other disease the hi@@ men &apos;s hi@@ ch German doctors have seen many her training , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery programme .
paras@@ ite tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis or Tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so hard to recognize , &quot; and it &apos;s not far to know that the difference of water is due to the aid of the aid .
the Syri@@ ans had a high performance image system , un@@ certain refugees and even doctors .
in order to encourage prac@@ ti@@ sing , they must , however , have their qualification and gives it even further ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees in Germany , according to the separation of the Bund@@ esp@@ sy@@ cho@@ therapy ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) psych@@ ic : most of them suffer from a post @-@ inev@@ it@@ ably severe stress or in depression .
particularly inf@@ rin@@ ably in the refugee camp , said Dietrich Mu@@ z , president of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent study published by the TU Munich in Munich shows that every fifth of the refugee camp was trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
wh@@ osoever is to be confused with a post @-@ minority tribute that is suffering from so @-@ called Flash stories called breath@@ s , dizziness , heart desires and death penalty .
further symptoms are acute - and concentration of inter@@ ferences , strong sc@@ in@@ activity and emotional inter@@ fer@@ rous .
Mun@@ z , in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic , Mun@@ z was required for early treatment .
until now , only four percent of the psych@@ ic @-@ sick people has a psycho@@ therapy .
indeed , psych@@ ic @-@ seek@@ ers for asylum seek@@ ers are granted to request for a psycho@@ therapy , but it will process for several months .
in addition , users would not be trained in social fields or doctors who are not trained to psychological diseases , please decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
that does it lead to mis@@ ass@@ ess@@ ments , &quot; Mun@@ z .

Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst is also thinking that position : &quot; we do not see our animals it doesn &apos;t matter well . &quot;
around 80 animals out of five different continents , each other mat@@ uring , about 80 animals .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ sts , &quot; how they have aff@@ ection@@ ately drawn , is read as the possibility of every need from the eyes .
we cooperate with the animals and have fun .
feels like the beast feels like to use it - and does not feel to cover the ring .

the expected reaction in turn takes over 2.7 billion dollars , from the fourth quarter , hp said in a declaration .
according to the restructuring measures , more competitive money , more sustainable cost structures for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer , which the unit should lead to the separation .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than today &apos;s HP , and we have a wide and deep@@ ening portfolio of shops that support companies in the transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .

FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that his te@@ amm@@ ates before play against Dynam@@ o Zagreb , behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere .
turning once again , when Wil@@ sh@@ ere emphasized that it was only September , and when his rehabilitation runs , there &apos;s no reason why he can &apos;t play Christmas again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games in England , and given its participation in the next summer around the European Championship is certain un@@ certain .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had greatly ended the final season after a separate ra@@ y@@ back injury , and had returned to its old pigs during the summer season .
this species of injury is not the career of him , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bones , which was not well cur@@ sed .
this is no major case .
this was only an accident .
it was not in connection with his buttons , or with the injuries , which he had previously .
this may be from purely theoretical vision but , as they are well acknowledged , there is the corresponding risk of injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also has an in@@ pleasant pattern .
their investigation by Prime Minister In@@ j@@ ú@@ s Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also star@@ red in just 65 of Arsen@@ als with 157 Lig@@ as@@ pi@@ es , the last five game times .
the wider picture for arsen@@ al that she had received six of eight players since 2007 / 08 , when the Premier League &apos;s clubs had been in charge of most of the po@@ ung@@ days .
Wen@@ ger accepted the potential of a devil in but Arsenal being that an improvement in the case of pl@@ aching ratio is ongoing during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you come from an injury , you have a period of time , set up a period where you need to strengthen your body and fight , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is very old enough to overcome the .
I hope his body is stabili@@ zed , I am confident that he will be doing and having been a career of its kind over , which he deser@@ ves .
Arsenal launches his Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday night to Din@@ amo Zagreb on Wednesday , and around Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ Copy at the upcoming Wednesday , and turning round it in the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , resulting in Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
. &quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it , a small break from the tru@@ ce , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
although Arsenal are clear favor@@ ites started , by Gruppe F , so the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the fun attractions in Europe with the largest power impact effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o has also been beaten after 41 games , after the &quot; insufficient quite &quot; campaign in the last season was launched .
the stadium was damaged by a devastating earthquake on Tuesday night , with the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year , it was the 10th of Zagreb .
W@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal had led the doctrine of the past season with the Champions League &apos;s sur@@ render for Monaco and remains committed by far off the far non @-@ profit world to fight with his management to the organisation &apos;s first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is substantial , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it did not yet work with Arsenal .
we were very close in 2006 very close , but on the other side I am long enough for business to seem realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not an iner@@ ator .

in the age of more than social media , communication , with its main focus on the substance , is the in@@ ability of the response to an important part .

this super@@ ficial success is dominated by the domin@@ ical , psych@@ ologists , social status , social status , social status , and del@@ ity in regard to personal development and friendship , which acts on our spiritual health and a lot of deep injury .

di Maria will meet to help PS@@ G to help Had@@ ö
Angel Di Maria is a Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and band Cav@@ ani which leads to his Tre@@ ffer by Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets the new dé@@ but in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps to head to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the response to the game .
Angel from Maria and Edinburgh Festival Cav@@ ani held the course of the Paris Saint Germain and the Champions League 2014 with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prince Park stadium on Tuesday left .
in times less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League , the PS@@ G player , who brought his champion in the way , though for@@ c@@ ashed a series of opportunities however before being finally achieved a head deck near Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ ou@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k even in the A , Paris is needed a strong start to the Swedish Master , as she did not only requires the qualification for the K.@@ fest event , but a improving on the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they took the points when they took away , there was no class entry to the gate behind the gate . he later went to the game against his home town @-@ team , and against the club , which he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 , when he came out .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win home or re@@ wards in the Champions League . thus , it &apos;s a good start to get 2 : 0 , which cause problems to cause problems to be able to design , even if there are certain things that we have used in the course of the season , &quot; said :
&quot; this is a good fore@@ man .
we wanted to win and we won , even though I regre@@ t that we had not achieved another or two other doors . &quot;
the Stur@@ movi@@ c returns after a breach of three changes in the Paris @-@ Team , that ended on the weekend a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on his own place against Bordeaux , the First League , but he was able to pay back in the fourth minute through Di Maria .
the Argent@@ in@@ ean wing f@@ ading was taken as the man who had taken over the next level in Manchester United States , and made it clear why he went to Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis through his own place before he received in Johan Wil@@ lands and moved into the long corner of the multilingual network .
but if any man believed that PS@@ G would be a big win , which was far been dis@@ appointed .
Malm@@ ö , born Cel@@ tic in a Play @-@ off point to reach this level , joined them with a nine @-@ man def@@ endants in the field and was tied a he@@ avier with a five @-@ man @-@ trial and a heavy bag .
but besides a gift from Nikola D@@ jur@@ ad@@ ic , who remains un@@ related to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s pole over the 3@@ 4th day give them some little when the attack .
but instead , the PS@@ G itself were sometimes taken sometimes , with some patches for tre@@ aties , as well as for the least five attempts per day in the first half of the settlement , after Cav@@ ani had taken him up after the re@@ start .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill . if he brought his people in the game , and it is a pass of the Stur@@ movi@@ c plane , which is in a turning , who remains the by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute &apos;s posts .
the second gate was finally , shortly after the hours brand due to Cav@@ tat . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus achieved his sixth win of the season , after the cap@@ turing is a left f@@ ears of Max@@ well .
this finished all the thought that Malm@@ ö came back to the back@@ rest , and just an excellent stop of Wil@@ ders , to stop David Lu@@ iz , which still du@@ mm@@ ed the Final result , before you can see the prec@@ lu@@ des of@@ sport@@ al Lav@@ and@@ zzi , a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age of Har@@ eide , followed later that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said , &quot; our last Champions League team was in December last year .
since then , we have played only in the Swedish League , which has not the same level .
the quali@@ fications does not exist . &quot;
hat@@ off to Paris !

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ seat .
in the presence of President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , on Wednesday , Ign@@ azi@@ o San was bap@@ tised in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io hill in the name of the German reform .
on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now shown as a &quot; German the@@ ologist of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of Rome , next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name was named after the working group of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled the protest in the city of the Pop@@ es of Rome as a minority , often just in ob@@ sc@@ urity .
with the square , in a symbolic way , there was clearly visible that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome was welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ ine monks at the year 1510 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he recommended the city then a ann@@ ot@@ ba@@ bel city in the morning .
his negative impressions will be followed by the view of Histori@@ ans in his later fight against Rome .
in 1954 , Luther was initiated the evening of the evening draft in his th@@ eses against the un@@ equi@@ voc@@ alism .
in the first three years , Hammer became a three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) Dorn@@ chamber is one of the haupt@@ werke , which painted for its Bible in Ot@@ mar .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has been updated and updated the implementation of its Bible text .
the word of this word was the word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , that now appeared with su@@ mp@@ tu@@ ally images .
at the beginning of this picture was for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 designs had published his very personal vision@@ ary interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and screen .
his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colors and un@@ imagin@@ ative forms has the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but he does not go wrong with &quot; funny song &quot; images .
on the contrary , the respective topics are adapted , which is quite different .
in about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt SVD , work for three years , that he worked as a subj@@ ective and artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; book of books . &quot;
it was created to use the themes of the Way of the Cross , Pl@@ ath , Command@@ ments , or fa@@ ders of our piece .
thus he has been fascin@@ ated by several partners , this is the same for the Luther @-@ publishing house with his the@@ ological approach as well as for the Kettler @-@ publishing company with its main focus on art books .
and this is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ r@@ ath , who on the basis of painting with the respective Bible , has been gra@@ ppl@@ ing on the basis of painting .
it has interpreted the Bible in Ot@@ mar to select the Bible , so today the working place has translated . &quot;
these texts are as verb@@ al level of al@@ ts painting .
immersed in the original version of Martin Luther and , in a set of the artist , he formulated his own personal thoughts on the right condition .
the jewelry cord has golden Let@@ ters .

robot au@@ tos : government wants to re@@ iter@@ ate for Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government of Technology , Germany is expected to be leading by the Federal Government of Technology .
in Wednesday , the federal cabinet agreed on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport , Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which was responsible for investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday at the edge of the Autom@@ ated IAA in Frankfurt on Wednesday .
the automated and connected process will increase the transport of road and help less st@@ oves , Do@@ brin@@ dt said .
he wants to discuss the topic even with his counterpart , from the G@@ 7 states to discuss the representatives of the industry .
the new strategy paper from the Ministry of Economy includes , in which , the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a drop @-@ rise in digital radio hobby .
the test track of the new technology is currently being created by a test run on the 9 in Bavaria .
for that driver &quot; does not take any additional adhesive risk material , &quot; the Federal Government wants to verify the legal framework conditions , and if necessary , to customi@@ ze the new developments . &quot;
thus , Germany is planning to deplo@@ y about an international level that the permissible speed can be raised by ten kilometres to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government wants to deplo@@ ying it to a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only looks the people as a driver .
when automated driving , motor car takes over the lead , and the driver will drive more and more to passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras , processing the environment , and process data in seconds .
depending on the board of the Economic Affairs of the study , highly automated driving to motor@@ ways is technically possible by 2020 .
nevertheless , cycling &quot; less vehicles in public streets &quot; are still expected to be expected only by 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the field of driver research assistant , and the highly automated driving function at the Germany location represents the authors of the study in 2025 with approx . EUR 8.8 billion .
&quot; the digital connectivity of the P@@ k@@ oder can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD organization S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l .
the question of liability on accidents and safety of the drivers must be fully cleared by the drivers .
still you see the Germans self @-@ riding brand but sk@@ ep@@ tically - much more than British or American .
one on Wednesday at the AA report by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the testing laboratory DE@@ K@@ RA , in fact , only eight percent of Germany believe that Aut@@ onom@@ ari@@ zation cars will be reflected in the next ten years , 31 percent are not expected at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents with automated driving cars , in the USA 33 percent .
in the case the car driver in Germany are not ready to leave itself entirely on an independent vehicle .
according to a data collection in the input field , only seven percent will be granted , control during the travel to all streets .
on the highway , which must be borne in the flowing traffic must be 15 percent , in St@@ au 45 percent .
well each V@@ ated the car would be left to the control .

the first diagnosis was clear over the 20 @-@ year @-@ old co @-@ player from Bas@@ tian Sch@@ ick @-@ star@@ ters .
exactly It &apos;s way to charge for a En@@ f@@ ant .
it is a mixture of a very large mo@@ p @-@ frame and a qu@@ in@@ p frame set : the designer Jean Paul Pel@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlight : mannequins , which is easy to look after projection with video projection .
they out@@ fit the spectacular creations of the French designer , which led to the great Star of the Mo@@ des@@ ic , among others , with Mad@@ onn@@ ades and he was able to plug him into one in the hands .
and now I have no longer say that I am the en@@ ant to the Haute C@@ out@@ ure , because I used white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier , it was really easy to have since then it is common , &quot; said Tar@@ tier .
to see the visitors &quot; From The side@@ walk &apos; ( From a pav@@ ement to the cat@@ walk ) which , at the Kunsth@@ alle of hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , the cat@@ walk that the fashion designer sends his way to a vision of his person in the beginning of September .
he really had been in theory , since : &quot; for me an exhibition tells me a little bit after death , &quot; he said .
if you die , one comes to the museum .
the impressive collection had already made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris railway station in Montreal .
&quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful clothing , &quot; said the Director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren .
it may be tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give a gli@@ mp@@ se of the rich work of the man &apos;s history , who has written a fashion in fashion , having completed an apprenticeship , without ever having completed a education .
chron@@ ology the show does not arise , but it is a well @-@ developed plastic art works for which a much effort was operated : to create the pupp@@ ets , a model , and a style of Styl@@ ist .
14 tons of material have the makers according to the data of the owner Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot after Munich .
shortly before the start of the October wre@@ ck , another special sm@@ ashing y was made here : a leather trousers viewer with a cord .
this will find the Madonna della Madonna .
he &apos;s always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are bad@@ ly known as men &quot; ) , and for people who are a bit differently .
later times of Ted@@ dy @-@ Mil@@ ti@@ ers Ter@@ dy is also shown at the exhibition .
in particular , he stands for the first , sophisticated construction work by designer .
as child ( he was not a good student and bad at the football ) he decided to Ted@@ dy B@@ HS and dresses , he said .
with the d@@ oll to play , his parents have not allowed him .
he decided to leave the cube by later .
he studied fashion journals and looked the plans of other designers , as it was said in Munich in 1993 .
later I bought the , but of course . I bought later .
for his first own fashion show , he had not pay the models for his first own fashion show .
they got nothing , but the car@@ rots will be allowed .
jewelry instead of t@@ d@@ dine - Pl@@ ec@@ lec@@ tic tip as a fashion @-@ niche
in former times it went to the long nitrogen plate and to make for pl@@ ast@@ ness therefore , meters .
the well @-@ insulated substances and tips were created in great amount for customers that , for example , ceilings and Gar@@ d@@ inen .
this does not work today , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , the managing director of the lead board .
instead , the mode is again important .
from the very beginning of the Pl@@ au@@ ener peak , mode he played a bigger role , then displaced by the home tex@@ til industry - and it being re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt is a few examples : characteristic of jewellery , in accessories such as bags and in regional tractor .
in all , the so @-@ called Vintage @-@ Mode , agreed on an previous experience with an increasing production potential .
those who operates in the textile industry in Germany is no niche , is no longer available on the market .
that means already make the half of all contracts here .
Mo@@ ck@@ flash Pl@@ auen will run together with nine other companies member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener and sti@@ cker .
only they are carrying that the protected label .
in the last 15 years , roughly 80 percent of its sales are marked .
private magazines and also the wholesale business , there are nearly no longer .
our products are not yet to reach our products on the way .
the mass of goods are made far cheaper than in the Asian region , and sold almost exclusively to chains .
moreover , a weaker export , currently to Russia and the USA .
sufficient reason for new ways .
this industry association has also tried to score his awareness of environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer . &quot; this year we perform a quality seal of quality and that we environmental sustainability and soci@@ ably . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; the refers to the used materials &quot; refers to . &quot;
designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the International University of Applied Arts in Z@@ wick@@ au and specialis@@ es in the Faculty of Applied Arts in Z@@ wick@@ au and specialis@@ es in the fields of visual art .
in order to imp@@ ose the competition from the Asian region , you need to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that need time and courage to hold .
there is a voltage box between the fresh ideas of the designers and factories that must make economic differences , &quot; says Schmidt .
as a result , a complete product is often found only easy to keep a customer base .
aged 40 years ago , Kat@@ i Re@@ uter was the historic snow line of the island .
during the machine , the machine will cut small cows .
that was inspired by the Pl@@ au@@ stri@@ ve Gold@@ smith announced in what we were inspired , &quot; I was able to begin with traditional Pl@@ au@@ spices . &quot;
now , they use the snow line for their beauty .
during a comprehensive process , she previously defines the pattern in silver .
many people of the region are characterized by the subject of Pl@@ au@@ spices - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .

EU wants to double mercury limit in Rau@@ b@@ fish .
the European Commission is intended to double limit values for mercury in big markets and consumers so strongly , as a clearly higher dose of the nervous breakdown .
the food organization &apos;s food watch , which provides a focus on paper paper : &quot; risks and adverse events in accordance with respect to serious economic and environmental policy are carried through with full power to fluctu@@ ations and inf@@ ants . &quot; he declared Matthias Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt of Food@@ watch .
Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt was said to identify the benefits of the nervous system for big fish at the end of the eating @-@ chain such as Hai@@ - or slaughter fish from &quot; economic reasons &quot; on two milli@@ grams of mercury &quot; per kilogram of fish . &quot;
big birds @-@ fish but already today are so strongly with mercury , that is to be sold on the basis of current limit values about 50 percent of the blades .
after dou@@ bling of the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 % were sold un@@ sold .
in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU wants to re@@ produce the limit values to other fish from a limit of 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
as &quot; tri@@ ck , &quot; but as &quot; tri@@ ck , &quot; because smaller Fried@@ k@@ fish , like about car@@ p are usually relative , so they comply with the planned maximum values already today .
therefore , the ab@@ sen@@ ate in Kl@@ einf@@ eld was therefore not &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ri@@ c man@@ œ@@ u@@ man@@ oeuvre which helps to identify the economy . &quot; explained Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt .
mercury ? is a person for man @-@ toxic , sh@@ wn on the food chain especially in Rau@@ b@@ fish .
the Federal Government wants to war@@ ns that &quot; already small quantities would be affected by the n@@ atives of the nervous system . &quot;
the Federal Environment Ministry is declared to be one of the applicable values , however , that a &quot; health @-@ risk of public population &quot; should not be expected . &quot;
mercury rein@@ forcement is especially suitable for the environment through the coal use in the environment .
according to a written according to the Federal Ministry of Labour , the German coal plants could contribute more than six tons of mercury in the year , and alena Ba@@ er@@ bo@@ ck ordered more than six tons of mercury in the total , two thirds of the total quantity .
the concentration of mercury in f@@ ishes of river Elbe , Rhine and Donau is held permanently and covering , &quot; the &quot; mirror is cited in March from the paper .
in the past year , European feder@@ ations of mercury in fish already included the most common health risks in the EU @-@ warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
food@@ watch causes consumers for the protest against the plans of the EU on : www.@@ qu@@ eck@@ silver @-@ ac@@ .@@ food@@ stuff . &quot;
