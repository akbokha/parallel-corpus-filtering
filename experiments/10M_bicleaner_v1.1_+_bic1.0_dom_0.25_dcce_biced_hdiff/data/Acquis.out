between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States , Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxemburg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) and the International Development Organisation ( Organization ) .
in ER@@ WA@@ EM@@ ENT the following reasons - a ) The EEC has decided to provide a special re@@ ac@@ tionary approach to the conference for international economic cooperation . to help the immediate demand of individual countries with low income , whose development is ob@@ struc@@ ted by General Con@@ sour@@ cent@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ any problems .
C ) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States that the whole of the Member States paid contribution to entry into force within six months , and as far as possible , within two years , following entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its best to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the Organization have cons@@ ulted on each other about the proposed and management of this agreement and the central bind@@ ings to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the context of this agreement .
for this purpose , the EEC outlined a table which is evident in which it intends to use the criteria defined in this agreement -
&quot; &quot; &quot; the organization is aimed at contribut@@ ing a special account under the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special shareholders &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is derived from the Member States to the agreement as an administrator and is used ( in this capacity the organization is designated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Administrator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , namely only to the purpose of this agreement and according to the provisions of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the promotions will be separately and separated from any other accounts and assets of the organization .

B ) Payment is carried out in two install@@ ments , ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . depending on the agreement , this agreement or another between the EEC and the administrator at the date of time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the balance to the 1st January 1979 or at another time that was agreed between the EEC and the administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget .
C ) Each Member State can pay the payments before above on request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ste@@ ward takes part in the usual method of organis@@ ing approximately proportional p@@ ho@@ ons to the cash or the bill to cover the expenses for the special underlying loan and to compens@@ ate the expenses for the special shareholders in a reasonable manner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the gran@@ ting of this loan , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC :
III ) to the extent , in which international economic factors have contributed to the current and se@@ eable economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further credit card capacity to loan conditions without compensation ; and
VII ) to the extent that concerns the problems of the countries concerned by contributions from other sources can be regulated .
each special loan granted to financing a well @-@ risk and rapidly exp@@ iring development program or pre@@ ventive ( including a sec@@ toral programme of development ) , which is ir@@ respective of the process and practices that are considered for the approval of the organization financed by the organization , which is considered to consider the intention of the pre@@ am@@ ity to this agreement .
the means of the special shareholders may not be used instead of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which has been approved for a programme or project , which has been approved by the directors of the Bank or organization on the day of arrival .
apart from section 4 , special rates are subject to the same rep@@ ay@@ ment that will be valid for the organization granted by the organization ; they are , therefore , in ten years , in 50 years , refundable .

the recei@@ pts from each special loan contract can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient or for goods or services , which have been established in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization has been fixed , recip@@ i@@ ents to receive a recipient at the time of the loan .
the pay@@ roll payments will be transferred to the special shareholders &apos; payments , and the amount paid in this way will return as soon as possible from the administrator to the relevant member state after its entry , as soon as possible .
the Administrator has been teaching the EEC to the audit by the directors of the directors , through the directors of the directors and the directors approved by the directors .
during the time of the payout of the special payment loans , the Administrator has been informed quar@@ terly to the development of the special loans and made expenses for this year .
the Administrator transfers the EEC as soon as possible after the conclusion of the financial year &apos;s financial year , with an assessment of an external audit@@ or with an assessment of the external audit@@ or of the organization .
after full payout of the special loans by the EEC as soon as possible , the Administrator @-@ manager transm@@ its a detailed report on the projects and programmes sponsored by the Sonder@@ shareholder .
the Administrator creates and runs suitable recordings and accounting records , from which the posts to the special shareholders , which account for the account from the account , and the payments paid from the account are evident .
the EEC and the Administrator work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .

the BIS may include stand@@ by credit agreement with central banks of the credit@@ ors if the banks ask a corresponding application .
the agreement could be concluded by the amount paid by the credit@@ or to the amount paid by the credit@@ or , namely within a total amount of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invoice units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future regist@@ rations of the member countries .
however , already listed below are some conditions listed below which the BIS would be ready to use .
with each stand@@ by @-@ credit , the BI@@ Z would initially take over an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions , without having crossed it a total of five years .
with the opening of the loans , as well as their increasing extension , the BI@@ Z would calculate a credit opening commission .

in the form of a exchange between the European Economic Community and the Argentine Republic on Trade with H@@ amm@@ el - and L@@ amm@@ ite
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will give myself to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations for the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep - and goat meat over the commun@@ ion . in the course of these negotiations the two parties are as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot;
- fresh or ch@@ illed chicken , lamb and goat meat ( 02.0@@ 1 A IV ) ;
as part of this agreement , the import opportunities for hamm@@ ers - , lamb and the lamb of Argentina after the community are set at the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in slaughter ( 1 ) .
in order to ensure the correct functioning of the agreement , Argentina is oblig@@ ated to ensure that the amount quantity is not exceeding and cooled down according to traditional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the offer form due to changes in technology and in trade , the two parties of this agreement are subject to each other before introducing a change in the listed under number 10 , to find an appropriate solution .

the total amount called under number 2 is determined with the date of Greece &apos;s accession to the community to 23 000 tons of slaughter .
the community adop@@ ts all to avoid a market development which could imp@@ air the marketing of Argentine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb on the market within the agreed quantity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the community meets the provisions of inter@@ ven@@ ing conditions on frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulations of Argentine H@@ amm@@ el - and L@@ amm@@ el did not under@@ mines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agreed that every actual application of ex@@ chan@@ g@@ ations or other convey@@ ances shall only be determined at prices and conditions that take part in accordance with the existing international obligations and consider the traditional share of the community in world trade with these products .

the liquid content of the concentration consists of either the remaining plasma or from a suitable for an is@@ ot@@ onic artificial water @-@ wat@@ ered solution which was added after the plasma distance .
the volume of the red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , the approximate concentration of red blood cells is used , the approximate percentage of the er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit ) is specified on the label .
all processes required for the production need to be performed under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the extraction must be carried out under the use of a ster@@ ile , closed system , and exclusively by printing .
if an artificial water @-@ wat@@ ered solution is added , so on the label you can also specify their volume and composition .
the human dry plasma is derived from the fluid from the fluid , which places in cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ging or se@@ di@@ ments of human body .
the human dry plasma is gained by cooling drying or any other method , by which a den@@ om@@ ination of the proteins is avoided .
the dry product is easily dissolved in a water volume which corresponds to the fluid quantity , from which one passes in the production of the substance .
the protein concentration of the so saved solution must not be less than 45 g per liter , and the solution must not contain a visible sign of ha@@ em@@ oly@@ tic products .

to reduce the risk of transfer of in@@ ox , are to reduce mixtures , which contain no more than 12 donations , or use other methods that make known this danger in a comparable way .
one of the fluid quantity , from which one went out in the production of plasma , corresponding water quantity must be reached ; the substance must be completely dissolved in 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C .
a given quantum plasma is dissolved in the water quantity , which was produced according to the fluid quantity , corresponds to the solution ; the solution is subjected to following tests :
II ) one puts 1 ml of solution a sufficient amount of thro@@ mb@@ in or calcium chloride , so is ag@@ ulation ; the process can be accelerated in the brood @-@ oven at 37 ° .
due to the 24@@ stu@@ ary drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ gest@@ ation under a pressure of more than 0.0@@ 2 mm , mercury may not occur in the human dry plasma loss loss over 0,5 % .

a reag@@ ent for blood groups must respond with all tested blood samples which have the tigen containing the antibody or another in the label stated substance .
if a reag@@ ent is often used by the manufacturer , the following factors or appar@@ itions may not occur : a ) hem@@ at@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the tit@@ er is measured by always new di@@ lution of the fra@@ ction to double in a suitable medium .
the tit@@ er is the re@@ zi@@ pro@@ ke value of the number of the strongest ser@@ um dil@@ ation in which reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution will be calculated solely by volume of blood cells in the total volume .
in anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents , which are to be used for object carriers , the activity is expressed through time , which is necessary for an ag@@ glut@@ ination on a slide vehicle .
the World Health Organisation has established anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B reag@@ ents as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D reag@@ ents for blood groups and reag@@ ents , and other specif@@ icity at@@ tested at the time of the present .
according to definition there is a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the tit@@ ers who are observed in individual feeding red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of reag@@ ents for the blood group of the majority of speci@@ alities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ally , which is observed in a series of di@@ lution in a thro@@ thro@@ cy@@ te .
the tit@@ er gives the di@@ lution of the reag@@ ent in the last mixture within a series on which a micro@@ scop@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood groups ( for the time Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B ) , can be expressed in comparison to the International Standard Pre@@ par@@ ate or a State of Standards of International Units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .

if a reag@@ ent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should remain for at least one year .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date of a reag@@ ent form according to the label is only one year after the final satisfactory impact test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry repairs is based on the results of the hus@@ band@@ ry trials ; it is appro@@ ving by the state regulatory authorities .
dry re@@ las@@ ia are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum container , in the glass container where they have been dried and so is so locked that no moisture can penet@@ rate .
a dry re@@ mun@@ ity may lose a maximum of 0.5 % of his weight if due to further drying our phosph@@ or pent@@ oxi@@ di@@ x at a pressure of no more than 0.0@@ 2 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the reag@@ ent ( or the tox@@ ic@@ ore@@ mentioned ) can be added , unless the reag@@ ent is continued with the added substance , ensuring specif@@ icity and effectiveness .
sera human origin into blood groups must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein @-@ nitrogen per ml .
the reag@@ ents , in@@ different , whether in flu@@ ent form or after the dis@@ resolution , must be transparent and may contain neither se@@ di@@ ments nor yellow particles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reag@@ ents for the international exchange of certain reag@@ ents are to be dy@@ ed as far as possible , at least until the international convention passed through a uniform system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reag@@ ents for blood group determination are in such a way and disper@@ se in such quantities that the reag@@ ent container will not only be used to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also for the execution of tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity required in a container must be so large that the contents may be used to implement the efficacy testing described in this protocol .
the manufacturer @-@ Lab has passed over all production levels and controls in reag@@ ents for blood @-@ typ@@ ing written records .
appropriate samples of all passed reag@@ ents are so long to keep up from the lab , until it is assumed that the batch is no longer used .
the reag@@ ents used for blood groups may contain substances of human , animal , plant materials ( or mineral ) of origin ; some of these constitute the effective component , the others are the necessary tools to strengthen the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the reag@@ ent .
for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are divided according to the origin of their effective supply in three groups .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin contain solely substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal reag@@ ents may not contain substances of human origin .
each single container is a black @-@ to @-@ white printed label in English and French language which contains the following data : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the amount or , in dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the liquid needed to be used ,
it also has the label , or the label on the cardboard box , where the individual containers are located , or the instructions enclosed with the container : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
