the present document is a summary of the European Public Report ( EP@@ AR ) which is explained how the Committee created for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) in order to obtain recommendations on the use of the drug .
if you require further information on your sickness or treatment , please read the package deal ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you want further information regarding the CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for inser@@ tion ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. te@@ res thinking and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and mad@@ ness ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , a mental disorder where patients man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal feeling ) alternat@@ ely have with normal mood .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe economic episodes and to pre@@ ventive medical episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ oral disorders if the oral in@@ gest@@ ion of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be applied to intake or melting tabl@@ ature in patients with hat@@ ching of tablets .
in patients who simultaneously connect other medicines that are equally re@@ min@@ ed as Ab@@ li@@ fy should be adapted to the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which allow the communication of nerve cells themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ari@@ a raz@@ ol is probably used mainly as a &quot; partial Ag@@ onist , &quot; for the recept@@ ors of the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ter d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that , as a 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and d@@ op@@ amine , this means lower degree as the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ter , in order to activate the recept@@ ors .
since Dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin also play a role in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance , it we@@ ars to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and their re@@ occurrence is prevented .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent re@@ occurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over a year .
in two studies , the efficacy of injection solution was compared in two studies of 80@@ 5 patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or similar diseases , compared to a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy became over twelve weeks at 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and plac@@ ebo , to prevent re@@ occurrence , to 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms have been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tor was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder which were associated with increased un@@ rest , with the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medicine ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
all trials used to change the symptoms of patients based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment .
the company also led studies by investig@@ ating how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and solution to absorb ( decreases ) .
in both studies with injection solution , patients that Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased un@@ rest than the patients who received a plac@@ ebo .
when applying the bi@@ polar disorder Abi@@ li@@ fy was reduced in four of the five short @-@ term clinical symptoms effectively treated as plac@@ ebo .
Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented for up to 74 weeks as a plac@@ ebo the re@@ occurrence of almond episodes with previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses have also been more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy to intake ( observe with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , head@@ ache ( di@@ lap@@ id@@ ation ) , head@@ ache ( const@@ ip@@ ation ) , vom@@ iting , Nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , Nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , sp@@ ittle , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) and anxiety ( in@@ som@@ nia ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mostly lack@@ ed man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes spoke to the treatment with Ari@@ a pip@@ ing , compared to the risks .
in addition , the Committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with chronic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when oral therapy is not suitable to conc@@ e@@ aled against the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for introducing and Abi@@ li@@ fy in the whole of the European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who produced mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ a raz@@ ol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day a day regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven although single patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , ir@@ respective of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors may just@@ ify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from Combin@@ ation Therap@@ y , the Ari@@ a pipe dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ des &apos;s behavior belongs to psych@@ otic ill@@ nesses and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases following before or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ a pip@@ ol ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ika .
Ari@@ ni@@ raz@@ ol should be used with caution in patients with known cardi@@ ovascular diseases , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , conditions for hyp@@ ot@@ onia pre@@ disp@@ on@@ ation ( dehy@@ dr@@ ation disease , treatment with blood pressure fever tox@@ ins ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ oc@@ ci@@ zed and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that followed one year or less , there were occas@@ ional reports of while treatment with arias by Ari@@ a raz@@ ol .
if patients treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y patients and symptoms of late @-@ dy@@ n@@ ine@@ esis , should be with@@ drawn , reduce the dose or reduce the treatment .
if a patient developed signs and symptoms , which indicate a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all Anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , have to be depos@@ ed .
therefore , Ari@@ a pip@@ el@@ ol in patients with Kr@@ amp@@ ires should be used in the history of history or with conditions related to cr@@ amp@@ ires , with caution .
56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ a raz@@ raz@@ ol to patients associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ ni@@ raz@@ ol were treated , an increased risk of death in comparison to the plac@@ ebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events in treated with Ari@@ a pip@@ el@@ ol treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ de or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar com@@ a or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ ic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there is no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ ic drugs treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be observed in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing the glucose values .
a weight gain is generally observed in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar regim@@ ens , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic membrane , with weight gain as a side effect and may lead to severe complications .
owing to the primary effects of Ari@@ a raz@@ ol to the central nervous system , caution is advis@@ able when Ari@@ a pip@@ ing is taken in combination with alcohol or other central medicines such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ag@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption of the Ari@@ a raz@@ ol , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study of healthy subjects a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ ine ) increased its AU@@ C by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other high @-@ effective In@@ hibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , like flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore , similar dose @-@ reductions should be made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &quot; bad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Po@@ or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ a pip@@ el@@ ol in comparison to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabolism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you consider the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should weigh potential risks for patients .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ eases , might have similar effects and therefore should have similar dose reductions .
after finishing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the dose height before beginning of the accompanying therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered jointly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be used with an even increase in the Ari@@ al concentrations .
clinical trials showed a significant effect on the metabolism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ met@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ method@@ ology of morph@@ ine morph@@ ine ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ tic@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ met@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ a raz@@ ol .
due to the in@@ adequate data protection for the human being and because of the concerns caused by the animal protection , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit is just@@ i@@ fies the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
however , as in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients ought to be warned not to use hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are safe that Ari@@ mer@@ raz@@ ol has no negative impact .
in more common adverse events ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) the following side effects were classified as medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the incidence of side effects specified below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
sch@@ izophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks occurred in patients with a total of less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ n@@ in@@ esia , compared with patients who were treated with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % was treated in patients under Ari@@ a pip@@ ol treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under Plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated in patients treated with Ari@@ a pip@@ ing , 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ et therapy .
theoretical episodes with bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was in patients under Ari@@ a pip@@ el@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was treated in patients under Ari@@ a pip@@ ol treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
during a period of 26 weeks during a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ a pip@@ el@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ a raz@@ ol and plac@@ ebo where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , yiel@@ ded no medical significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ a pip@@ el@@ ol , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .

clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate over@@ do@@ si@@ ders were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg , and without death sequence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although no information about the effectiveness of a ha@@ em@@ ulation occurs in the treatment of over@@ dos@@ ing with Ari@@ a pip@@ el@@ ol , it is unlikely that Hem@@ angi@@ aly@@ sis is in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits , as a high plasma micro@@ pipe connection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ ni@@ raz@@ ol in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on d@@ op@@ amine di@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors medi@@ ated .

in the gift of arith@@ me@@ raz@@ ol in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy subjects the Pos@@ it@@ cartridges @-@ Tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent decrease of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 recept@@ or @-@ lig@@ ine , at the nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the tur@@ key .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients showed positive or negative symptoms . compared to plac@@ ebo a statist@@ ically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol study was 52 % of the response patients who contributed to the study medication , in both groups ( Ari@@ a raz@@ ol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression dial , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia a significantly higher reduction in response rate that was found in 34 % in the Ari@@ a raz@@ ol group and at 57 % under plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ et multi @-@ blind study with sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was observed significantly less patients with a weight gain of at least 7 % ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . 5.6 kg ) .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with a flexible or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ il@@ raz@@ ol showed a versus plac@@ ebo superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ il@@ raz@@ ol showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo and active mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ il@@ raz@@ ol showed a compared to plac@@ ebo covered efficiency in Week 3 and a maintenance effect , which was comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in Week 12 .
in addition , Ari@@ a raz@@ ol also showed a comparable share of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the mania on like lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without mental stress , which partially appeared over 2 weeks , the companion therapy with Ari@@ a pip@@ el@@ ol showed superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .

in Ari@@ a pip@@ ol , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female volunteers , and in sch@@ izophren@@ ic investigation , sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients showed no sex dependent effects .
a simulation @-@ specific evaluation for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking loc@@ ating the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ ol .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ il@@ raz@@ ol and Deh@@ y@@ dro @-@ Ari@@ a raz@@ raz@@ ol were similar in patients with severe kidney disease . compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study of subjects with different gri@@ ev@@ ous liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function of Ari@@ a raz@@ ol and Deh@@ y@@ dro @-@ Ari@@ a raz@@ ol , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not enough to draw conclusions on their met@@ abolic capacity .

it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ ni@@ raz@@ ol in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on d@@ op@@ amine di@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors medi@@ ated .
in an O@@ lan@@ et multi @-@ blind study with sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was observed significantly less patients with a weight gain of at least 7 % ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . 5.6 kg ) .
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fixed dosage with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ il@@ raz@@ ol showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics has been compared to 30 mg in a tablet form of 30 mg , the relation between the geomet@@ rical C@@ max average of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , a chol@@ lu@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate Met@@ abol@@ ites in the G@@ alle from monkeys to the repet@@ itive oral gift of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean ste@@ ady @-@ state exposition ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of humans based on people ( mg / m2 ) .
these effects were observed in rab@@ bits that resulted in ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ fold of the central Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injec@@ tor solution is used for rapid control of ag@@ ility and behavior in patients with chronic episodes of bi@@ polar episodes , if a oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically attached , the treatment with Ari@@ a pip@@ ing solution should be completed and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pip@@ el@@ ol .
to minim@@ ize the res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be given on the individual clinical status using the medicines indicated already for conservation or acute therapies ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if an advanced oral treatment with Ari@@ a pip@@ el@@ ol is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y melting tabl@@ etten or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution to intake .
there are no investigations to the effectiveness of Ari@@ a raz@@ ol injection solution in patients with ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were caused differently from sch@@ izophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
in addition to a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ a raz@@ ol injection solution , the patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure dec@@ ay ( see Section 4.5 ) .
research on safety and efficacy of Ari@@ a raz@@ ol injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug det@@ ox@@ ification ( through exp@@ ul@@ ent or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ ni@@ raz@@ ol should be used with caution in patients with known cardi@@ ovascular diseases , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , conditions for hyp@@ ot@@ onia pre@@ disp@@ on@@ ation ( dehy@@ dr@@ ation disease , treatment with blood pressure fever tox@@ ins ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ oc@@ ci@@ zed and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less , there were occas@@ ional reports of while treatment with Ari@@ a raz@@ raz@@ ol .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , speed@@ ometer , swe@@ ating and cardi@@ ac disorders ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be observed in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing the glucose values .
a weight gain is generally observed in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar regim@@ ens , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic membrane , with weight gain as a side effect and may lead to severe complications .
nonetheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation is larger compared to the sole administration of Ari@@ a raz@@ raz@@ ol , in a study in which healthy volunteers , Ari@@ a raz@@ raz@@ ol ( 15 mg dosage ) was used as in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly to in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly ( 2 mg dosage ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H2 Ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ag@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption of the Ari@@ a raz@@ ol , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .

other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , might have similar effects and therefore should have similar dose reductions .
after finishing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the dose height before beginning of the accompanying therapy .

in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ ility and behavior distur@@ ban@@ ces , the Ari@@ il@@ raz@@ ol injection solution was associated with a statist@@ ically significant improvement in comparison to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the average annual recovery from the initial score on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement component at the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5.8 for plac@@ ebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ a raz@@ ol .
in analysis of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ ility , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the population population , but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced number of patients .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients showed positive or negative symptoms ( oral ) compared to plac@@ ebo a statist@@ ically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .

the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study which took part in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters of previously an anth@@ rac@@ y@@ c@@ line had received .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in a sole gift or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained in the drug ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing the side effects ) .
overall , in the case study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients on the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicine .
considering only the patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference in the efficacy of efficacy and survival in regard to the efficacy of disease and survival .
by contrast , patients who had previously obtained other treatment treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained .
it may also not be used in people who are still in breast @-@ breast or before the treatment of low Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ figures in the blood .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane found patients with which the first treatment could not be more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained pharmac@@ euticals not to be given with other medicines , to decrease side effects .
January 2008 , the European Commission granted Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the transportation of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed to the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line therapy is missing for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ rac@@ y@@ c@@ line @-@ contained therapy is not shown ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie ( Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ ium &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sen@@ sor@@ ial Neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
in sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 , treatment is to be reduced to grade 1 or 2 , and with all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adap@@ tions in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with affected kidney function were performed and there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adap@@ tions in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of ren@@ al function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 because of not sufficient data for the in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ related nan@@ op@@ ar@@ tic de@@ form@@ ulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have significantly other pharmac@@ ological features as other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be removed and recur@@ rent a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment , and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients there should be no new Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy cycles , until the Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ count rose again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clear@@ er with Abra@@ x@@ ane was not proven , kar@@ di@@ ale sens@@ us are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier Anth@@ ra@@ y@@ c@@ line treatment or based cardi@@ ovascular disease or lung disease .
in case of the patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rhe@@ a , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and persistent resources .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used during pregnancy or in women in a given age , which do not practice an effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential .
females in the age @-@ capable age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable detection method .

male patients should advise in the treatment of a sperm ob@@ servatory , as it consists of the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane the possibility of ir@@ reversible infer@@ tility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect the transport ability and ability to serve machines .
below are the most common and important inci@@ dents of side effects given in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated in the piv@@ ot@@ al Phase III clinical study every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most remarkable hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ ed ; leu@@ k@@ open@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of the Abra@@ x@@ ane patients treated and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects given in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as a mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tic acid in the blood , increased blood sugar in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ orus in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease :

ru@@ hel@@ o@@ red@@ ness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reaction is calculated based on a definite basis in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates from the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al correlation has been established .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules drug , which promotes the inter@@ storage of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from tu@@ bul@@ let indi@@ ces and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this stabili@@ zation leads to in@@ hibition of normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vit@@ ale inter@@ pro@@ phase and mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ s the trans@@ cy@@ t@@ osis of plasma systems into end@@ o@@ thel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been demonstrated that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in increases by end@@ o@@ thel@@ ial cells by the end@@ o@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this enhanced trans@@ end@@ o@@ thel@@ i@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ um@@ recept@@ or and due to the alb@@ um@@ bin@@ ate protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ temper@@ ed studies and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised phase III comparison study .
in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer with Abra@@ x@@ ane were treated , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 has been used as an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes on 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer that received every 3 weeks a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion with no pre@@ medication ( N = 229 ) .
upon recording in the study 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy first , 27 % had only ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ ases and 19 % due to met@@ ast@@ as@@ ation and ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time until progres@@ sion of the disease as well as progres@@ sion @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive first @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving one degree of patients who lived at a time during therapy a periph@@ eral new rop@@ athy level 3 .
the natural process of periph@@ eral new rop@@ athy for sound effects on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies .
the active exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analog to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane an patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration on multi@@ ph@@ as@@ ic way decreased .
the average distribution volume amounted to 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has an extensive precise distribution and / or soft distribution of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced positive tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane compared to a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ related Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearing of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher according to the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ gift ( 43 % ) than after a solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue coating is reported that Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed - to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ d@@ ih@@ y@@ off@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean recommended dose was 4 % of the total dose with less than 1 % of the total dose of 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ far @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance .
in the age of more than 75 years , only few data are available since only 3 patients were part of this age group at the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed showed an organic medicine , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and it contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference agents &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood pressure values , in which to occur with blood trans@@ fusion complications , in case of the procedure , a blood circulation is not possible and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician , the experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
injection can be carried out also by the patient or his co@@ uns@@ ell@@ or , if they have received an appropriate guide .
patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency or in patients receiving chemotherapy are given always in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ imal ) in adults or between 9,5 and 11 g / dl of infants .
the iron values of all patients are to be used before treatment , to ensure that no iron defic@@ iency is , and iron comple@@ mentary should be given during the entire treatment .
in patients who received chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ emia can cause an an@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ ine defic@@ iency , or that the body is not sufficient for the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in .
Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ ine is also applied to surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which enables it to become the formation of ep@@ oxy .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to an injection in a V@@ ene in a trunk of 4@@ 79 patients who were caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study were inj@@ ected at least eight weeks before E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o was inj@@ ected into a V@@ ene before they were either deported to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continue to received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for efficacy was the alter@@ ation of the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ at values between the beginning of the study and the reference period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also put the results of a study in which the effects of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o was resear@@ ched with 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients who suffered from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ ids were killed in the same measure as with those patients who continue to get E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in contrast , patients who continue to get E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of an initial value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure that occasionally leads to symp@@ tom of en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , continuous , continuous head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ oxy or one of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are needed to ensure that there are no allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the drug has been approved for a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , which places Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information on the safety of the medicine , including information on the safety of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the Medi@@ ce Medic@@ P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg approval for the public transport of Ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union .

evaluation symptoms and symptoms can vary depending on age , gender and overall disease @-@ load ; therefore an assessment of individual clinical over@@ flow and disease management is required by the doctor .
a rise in hem@@ og@@ glob@@ ins by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lo@@ glo@@ bin values can occasionally be observed above or below the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin .
given these hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin vari@@ ability a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ are exceeds by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lo@@ am exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ep@@ ic @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .

these clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b @-@ value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) might need more coverage than patients with which initial an@@ emia is less heavy ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl ) or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b @-@ value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) might need higher degree of maintenance ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

symptoms and symptoms can vary , depending on age , gender and overall disease @-@ load ; therefore the assessment of individual clinical over@@ flow and disease management is required by the doctor .
given these hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin vari@@ ability a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored in order to ensure that Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose , which is necessary for control of the flu symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ are increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ s@@ number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , should be maintained three times per week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg per week .

6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg ep@@ oxy , which should be given once weekly for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgery and the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in this case , ep@@ oxy pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be given in each 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards .

if the H@@ b increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 ( see section 4.2 ) treatment of patients with chemical therapy @-@ related an@@ emia - doses above 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to apply re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction in the patient &apos;s participation , which should also consider specific clinical context .
in patients who are en@@ vis@@ aged for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ ae@@ dic procedure , if possible , before the beginning of ep@@ oxy @-@ therapy the cause of an@@ a@@ emia is examined and treated appropri@@ ately .
patients who prefer a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ ae@@ dic procedure should have an appropriate thro@@ mb@@ osis prophe@@ y@@ la@@ xis , as they have an increased risk for thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ic and vas@@ cul@@ ari@@ al diseases , particularly in case of underlying cardi@@ ovascular disease .
additionally , it cannot be excluded that during treatment with ep@@ oxy for patients with a starting sample of &gt; 13 g / dl , an increased risk of postoperative thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ic / vas@@ cul@@ ari@@ ous events can pers@@ ist .
in several controlled trials , ep@@ och@@ on@@ ine was not proven that they improve overall survival in tumor patients or reduce the risk of cancer progres@@ sion .

the most common effect during the treatment with ep@@ och@@ on@@ al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase of blood pressure or the wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ ous events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment of er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ines .

survi@@ vors and progres@@ sion progres@@ sion were examined in five major controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine @-@ treated patients and patients .
in these studies , with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in treated patients with an an@@ emia due to various common mal@@ ign@@ ancy , statist@@ ically significantly higher mortality compared to the controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and related complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine @-@ treated patients and in controls .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ genic events in tumor patients who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant Human Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
it is not clear how far these results are applied to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant Human Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine in tum@@ our patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of transfer@@ ring a hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ wert below 13 g / dl as a few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
ep@@ oxy @-@ al@@ fa policy after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy subjects and a slightly extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
following sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um levels of ep@@ och@@ in al@@ fa are much lower than the ser@@ um level , which are reached after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no trouble : the ser@@ um mirror remain the same , ir@@ respective of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .

A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( one disease that makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause , as well as in men .
it is applied in patients with a high fra@@ cture risk ( bone breaks ) , including patients who recently suffered a somewhat trau@@ matic hat@@ ching of the bone ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of the bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get have at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hat@@ ch@@ fra@@ cture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 ) or@@ ally or by injection in a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflamm@@ ation ) in the three days following the in@@ fusion of occurring symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache .
for treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ us@@ can only be prescribed by doctors , who have experience in treating this disease .

in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of sp@@ inal and hip frac@@ tures were examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 male and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hat@@ ch shell ; the number of frac@@ tures were examined over a period of up to five years .
in two studies , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indi@@ an indicator for efficacy was whether the salary of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzyme containing bone tissue ) in the blood is again norm@@ alized or by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of ver@@ te@@ frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cl@@ erg@@ ia ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis cor@@ als ) was reduced by 70 % compared to plac@@ ebo &apos;s patients .
compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ erg@@ ia ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those under Plac@@ ebo the risk of boun@@ frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hips , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta had a fra@@ cture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under Plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ us@@ asta appear within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent with repeated inc@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ amps may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to against z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or other compounds .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ ates patients are subject to risk of kidney problems , reactions to the fusion of oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( dying of bone tissue ) in pine .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta provides clari@@ fication material for physi@@ cians to prescri@@ be the A@@ cl@@ amps for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should turn to the doctor .

the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men is recommended a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg of A@@ cl@@ er@@ one annually .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hat@@ ch , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ amps is recommended two or more weeks after the operative supply of the hips ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ us@@ can only be prescribed by doctors , who have experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ amps , a long re@@ jection was observed in patients who have been addressed to therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient amount of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get to ensure a minimum of 500 mg of essential calcium , for at least 10 days following the gift of at@@ us@@ asta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently exp@@ elled low @-@ trau@@ matic Hü@@ ft@@ p , a initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ E. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular Vitamin D is recommended prior to the first A@@ cl@@ erg@@ us@@ in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ er@@ asta , can be reduced by means of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ er@@ asta .
patients with cardi@@ ovascular dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ us@@ asta is not recommended as a limited clinical experience for these patient groups .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination of older patients is similar to younger .
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ er@@ asta is not recommended for use in children and young@@ sters under the age of 18 , since data are missing to in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and efficacy .
A@@ cl@@ us@@ asta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) since patients had only limited clinical experience .
pre @-@ existing mort@@ al emia should be treated before the beginning of the therapy with adequate import@@ ation of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the quick inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure a temporary , occasionally symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ amps ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient amount of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get to ensure a minimum of 500 mg of essential calcium , for at least 10 days following the gift of at@@ us@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , poor oral hygiene ) should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates due to accurate pre@@ ventive dental treatment .
no data is available to patients who need dental attacks , whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in jaw areas .
the clinical assessment of the treated doctor should be the basis of each patient treatment plan and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ er@@ asta , can be reduced by means of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ er@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the pre@@ val@@ ence of adverse events reported by atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation was increased in patients who received A@@ cl@@ us@@ asta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who were plac@@ ebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Quest@@ ionnaire Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ amps ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) unwanted drug actions are listed in table 1 .
kidney function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic was associated with kidney function , which is regarded as a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the alter@@ ation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ( annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure , as well as a limited kidney function , was in a clinical study comparable to oste@@ opor@@ osis between the A@@ cl@@ an and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ us@@ cs compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on ass@@ essing the laboratory results , temporary as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic values entered ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , with 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ amps , compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ amps in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get @-@ studies .
all patients received supple@@ mental amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical frac@@ tures according to an envelope and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical waste , the vitamin D @-@ mirrors were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however , the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reaction following the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions like red@@ ness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ oc@@ rats in the max@@ ill@@ ary area became especially in cancer patients , above all in cancer patients ( primarily in jaw area ) , with bis@@ phosph@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid , were treated .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ opor@@ itis , and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks .

the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cl@@ asta reduced from 30 % to 12 months , compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the output value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the output value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and has been kept at 55 % below the output value of up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ E. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group treated with a group of 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the A@@ cl@@ amps treatment increased the BM@@ D in the total l@@ ump and shaft h@@ als at all points of time .
the A@@ cl@@ ican treatment conducted more than 24 months compared to the plac@@ ebo treatment in an increase of the BM@@ D around 5.4 % of the total amount and 4.3 % at the level of the string .
clinical efficacy in men in the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON study were random@@ ised to 508 men and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of am@@ us@@ asta was relative to the once weekly gift of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate to the percentage change of Len@@ den@@ wir@@ l @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone of A@@ cl@@ asta was investigated in patients and patients with radi@@ ologically advanced mor@@ boo Pa@@ get of the bone ( median um levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase accordingly to 2,@@ 6@@ times to 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal values when inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to taking 30 mg of cra@@ ed@@ ron once a day was demonstrated in two six months compar@@ ative studies .
a similar decrease in pain strength and pain relief was observed after 6 months compared to the initial results for A@@ cl@@ amps and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate .
patients who were classified as responsibility at the end of the six @-@ month primary study ( applied to therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 with A@@ cl@@ amps and the 107 against the patient @-@ based patients , who participated in the follow @-@ up study , could maintain the therapeutic approach with 141 of patients treated with an@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients , sustained at a mean duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
one single and multiple 5 and 15 minutes per@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data to be dos@@ ed independently .
after that , the plasma level quickly increased from &lt; 10 % of the maximum value to 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a constant phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ ph@@ as@@ ic van@@ ishing from the large circulation system with half @-@ value t drops 0.@@ 24 and t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with a terminal elim@@ ination cycle time t ½ to 146 hours .
the early distribution points ( α and the above , with the above 2 ½ values ) probably represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption in the bone and the discharge of the kidneys .
in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose involve urine , while the rest is bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the full body Clear@@ ance is ir@@ respective of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race , or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration at 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the area under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance of zed by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ atic systems is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans , because they are a weak or even no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , @-@ based inhibit@@ or of the 450@@ -

this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function to get down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min . no dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid requires .
as for severe kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , only limited data are possible , no statements are possible for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ infl@@ ated intraven@@ ous individual dose came in mice 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight .
for studies on dogs single doses have been 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ quadru@@ ple of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ chronic and chronic tox@@ icity in studies with intraven@@ ous application was determined by administered doses of 0.6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , in a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 3 @-@ fold of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , relative to AU@@ C , equals ) , well toler@@ ated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated treatment with repeated treatment positions that exceed the maximum of the intended human exposure , tox@@ ic@@ ological effects on other organs , including the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as on the intraven@@ ous injection point .
the most common finding in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aphy@@ si@@ cs of the long bone in the growth phase with virtually all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance .
in rats , there was a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity in doses of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ normal@@ ities and such a skel@@ eton .

summary of the EP@@ AR to the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Report ( EP@@ AR ) which has been explained how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has been judged to get recommendations on the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ abe@@ tic medication ) is not shown . • It can be used together with another di@@ abe@@ tic medication .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , met@@ form@@ in can not be satisfactory in the highest toler@@ able dose alone .
in combination with a sul@@ fa har@@ p or insulin , the existing dose of sul@@ fa drugs can be maintained , except in patients with hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of sul@@ fa drugs can be reduced or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin is better explo@@ ited and the blood sugar levels fall so that type 2 diabetes can be better set .
in more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos was examined in tri@@ ple@@ y patients ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fa har@@ p , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , showed how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos has resulted in a lower@@ ing of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value which makes the blood sugar equal to the doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg were lowered .
at the end of the Tri@@ plex study the effect of an additional gift from Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fa har@@ p showed a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional gift conducted by Plac@@ ebo to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin had been studied with 289 patients , the Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % to 6 months compared to 0.14 % in patients who took additionally plac@@ ebo .
the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were se@@ clu@@ sions , infections of the upper respir@@ atory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be applied in patients who may react hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other ingredients , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ abe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ de ( high blood pressure level - pur@@ ification - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos was supposed to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with which met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Office of Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to promote Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin for type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate , and with them met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) .
for the application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under the age of 18 , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who risk a risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attacks or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should begin treatment with the lowest available dose and increases the dose .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain or ec@@ lipse , especially those with reduced car@@ di@@ aler reserves .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain and ob@@ server if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin .
a cardi@@ ovascular Out@@ come study with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , and of existing advanced m@@ rov@@ ascular disease has been performed .
in this study , an increase in excess of heart failure , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output of liver disease ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the norm ) or with other signs of liver illness , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror increases to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver values are again to be controlled again as soon as possible .
if a patient has developed symptoms that point to a he@@ p@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , lo@@ ess@@ ness , fatigue , appet@@ ite and / or dar@@ ker p@@ ens , the liver values are to be evaluated .
the decision whether treatment of the patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on continues to be led by the laboratory parameters by the clinical assessment .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on a dose @-@ dependent weight gain was detected , which can stir from fat deposits and in some cases with a liquid re@@ tention .
as a result of a hem@@ atology , a minor reduction in the medium hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ ative controlled trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin to 3 @-@ 4 % ) and to a lower degree in patients under Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ent and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ glob@@ ins by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin @-@ sensitive patients , the Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on consists of oral or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ent or as a dual @-@ combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dos@@ is@@ dependent hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch was reported under the treatment of thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , including a occurrence or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ abe@@ tic mac@@ ular de@@ ification with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity .
it is un@@ clear if there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms , but contrac@@ ting doctors should be aware of a mac@@ ular procedure ; an appropriate ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary of the analysis of inde@@ xed events of random@@ ised , random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8.@@ 100 patients who were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on
the calculated fra@@ cture incidence was 1.9 tr@@ ams per 100 patients with the Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on patients and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patients years in women treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardi@@ ovascular events , frac@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patients years ) of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on were treated with patients with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patients ) with patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
patients should be aware of a pregnancy or if a patient desires a pregnancy or this entry , is to susp@@ end the treatment ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on investigation of exchange effects have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not have relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with drugs , which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ ers are not to be expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ zil ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is attri@@ but@@ able to the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on that reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ ine and increased insulin @-@ resistant insulin resistance , thereby reducing the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fossil growth .
very commonly &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( from these data not in@@ valuable ) .
this lead to a temporary change in the tumor and the refra@@ c@@ tive index of the lens , as they can also be observed in other hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ tic agents .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ gles stepped up on three times the upper limit of the norm range as often as plac@@ ebo , but less often than in compar@@ ative groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fa har@@ p .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with existing advanced m@@ rov@@ ascular disease was the frequency of heavy heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 1.6 % higher than under plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on resp@@ .
since the market launch has been reported in case of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , but more often if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure .
it was conducted in summary of the analysis of inde@@ xed events of random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients in patients treated with comparable medical treatment .
in the Pro@@ Active study period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of the patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in people who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day after seven days no symptoms appear .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to work on a activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ ic Pro@@ lifer@@ ator or Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) which results in animal model to increased insulin @-@ sensitive liver , fat and skel@@ eton muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral glucose analysis in the event of insulin @-@ resistant .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as a mon@@ otherapy has been carried out over two years to investig@@ ate the time of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy a blood sugar ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared with 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar were random@@ ised with in@@ sufficient optim@@ isation phase with insulin , to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared with the patients who continue to receive only insulin . a reduction of insulin @-@ s@@ ali@@ ation in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was observed .
in clinical trials over one year , a statist@@ ically significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ as compared to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested on type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics in a small , spread over 18 weeks .
in most clinical trials , a reduction of the entire plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in the HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels and an increase in the HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels were observed in the comparison to plac@@ ebo .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was reduced in comparison to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or gen@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d , the entire plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel .
in comparison to plac@@ ebo a statist@@ ically significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed , while under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d decreased values were observed .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on do not only reduced the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , but also improved tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this also has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption , as well as a tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardi@@ ovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced m@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ized in groups of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tic and cardi@@ ovascular treatment either in either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo .
after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is absorbed quickly , with the top concentration on un@@ altered Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in the plasma usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution from M @-@ IV to the effectiveness in approximately the tri@@ ples of the efficacy of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on could not affect the relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zil ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) reduces or reduces the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radioactive polym@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in humans the mar@@ ker was found mainly in the cases ( 55 % ) and to lower degree in the har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ elim@@ ination period of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is 5 @-@ 6 hours when humans are 5 @-@ 6 hours and the total active Met@@ abol@@ ites is at 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are similar in patients with reduced ren@@ al function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance of the parent form are similar .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and monkeys co@@ inci@@ de with repeated treatment with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ex@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ ph@@ ies .
this is attri@@ but@@ able to the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on which reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ ine and increased insulin @-@ resistant insulin , thereby reducing the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the f@@ low@@ up growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ plas@@ ia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male @-@ rats ) of the ure@@ tic epithel@@ ium were induced .
in a animal model of the family @-@ om@@ at@@ ous poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons resulted in increased frequency of col@@ lu@@ res .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white and whit@@ ish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated fra@@ cture incidence was 1.9 tr@@ ams per 100 patients with the Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on patients and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patients years in women treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardi@@ ovascular events , frac@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patients years ) of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on were treated with patients with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patients ) with patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in another study of two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in each with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were examined .
clinical trials over 1 year showed a statist@@ ically significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ as compared to the initial values .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on do not only reduced the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , but also improved tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this has an effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption , as well as on the he@@ p@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
although the study lack@@ ed its primary end@@ points , a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ deadly m@@ yo@@ car@@ bo@@ wel syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the Kn@@ uck@@ les , cor@@ on@@ ary re@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation and re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies suggest that with the intake of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not involve cardi@@ ovascular risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white and whit@@ ish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 45 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a summary of the analysis of inde@@ xed events of random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients who were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , showed an increased incidence of bone mar@@ qu@@ arri@@ es in women .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardi@@ ovascular events , frac@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patients years ) of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on were treated with patients with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patients ) with patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on do not only reduced the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , but also improved tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption , as well as a tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been resear@@ ched in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use insulin .
after 12 weeks concentration of a substance ( gly@@ co@@ y@@ li@@ ar hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror which indicates that the blood sugar levels were lowered considerably as with another human being .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to human ( c@@ DNA ) or one of the other ingredients .
in addition , doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be customized if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the full list can be found in the package directions ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of acet@@ yl@@ ane are ou@@ tw@@ eigh@@ ed in the treatment of diabetes against the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the Company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for introducing ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Pre@@ mixed insulin products normally be applied once or twice daily if a fast @-@ initial effect is desired with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
patients with their blood glucose levels increase substantially , for example , through a intensi@@ fied insulin therapy , hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms can be kept and should be advised accordingly .

the present document is a summary of the European Public Report ( EP@@ AR ) which is explained how the Committee created for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) in order to obtain recommendations on the use of the drug .
the medicine is an effective component of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin for insulin ( DNA ) , produced by using the so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology &quot; :
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 86 68 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ europ@@ a.@@ eu © EMEA 2007 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Author@@ ised for non business @-@ only the the EMEA ) How was Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id examined ?
Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may have to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the Company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for placing Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union .
if two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of the so @-@ acting insulin must be extracted , then the amount of the long acting insulin .
3 If the switch to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id is required in the patient with a dose of dose , it may be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before traveling , which are over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his doctor , as such tours may result in taking insulin and meals at other times , or should be taken .
5 General Dis@@ eases and complaints during the adoption of validity of the application . during the insulin delivery , local hyper@@ sensitivity reaction ( red@@ ness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma can occur at the injection point ) .
di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have grape varieties , swe@@ ets , bis@@ cuits or sugar fruit juice with in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven aid person or given by glucose , which is administered intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
a clinical test in an intensive care unit for treating hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 di@@ abe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ di@@ abe@@ tic patients demonstrated that a administered intraven@@ ous acet@@ ly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced the mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum concentration is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the entire duration of action is approximately 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied in a minor number ( n = 18 ) di@@ abe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 ) and adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) .
the data is limited , but accept the assum@@ ption that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to adults .
in@@ fusion systems with Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in concentrations of 0.05 % sodium chloride , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % D glucose ( 40 % sodium chloride , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % ) glucose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l potassium acid are stable at room temperature for 24 hours .
11 If the transfer to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id is required in the patient with a dose of dose , it may be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before traveling , which are over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his doctor , as such tours may result in taking insulin and meals at other times , or should be taken .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already exhibit the signs of cryst@@ all@@ ot@@ abl@@ ings , including arthritis ( pain and inflamm@@ ation in the joints ) or gene notes ( i.e. larger U@@ rat@@ chet deposits that may lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the hy@@ per portion is still higher than 6 mg per dec@@ imal , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , results may still occur ; therefore , the patient is recommended to take some more medicines at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t since it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study enrolled in 1@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to a plac@@ ebo ( plac@@ ebo ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for treating hyper@@ ur@@ ic hem@@ orrho@@ ids ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used twice daily in a dose of 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems get only 100 mg a day .
the main indi@@ an indicator for efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary amino acid was in the blood at the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of the patients , the Aden@@ ur@@ ic had given 80 mg of average daily , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of the patients who once daily weighed 120 mg per day in the blood of under 6 mg / dl .
in contrast , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ ine and none of the 134 patients were placed under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash , and abnormal liver values .
in particular in patients suffering from heart problems in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the blood of the ur@@ inary tract , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ emia due to diseases that have already led to u@@ rat@@ abl@@ ag@@ ings ( including one from the arch@@ et@@ ries @-@ known or current g@@ al@@ arms , and / or a se@@ al@@ ant ) .
if the ser@@ um concentration after 2 @-@ 4 weeks is still under 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dose of dose can be considered at AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
patients with severe kidney function limits the efficacy and safety were not fully investigated so far ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and young people since there are no experiences in children and teenagers , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended .
organ transplan@@ tation As it does not experience an experience in organ transplan@@ tation , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two piv@@ ot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) that were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic com@@ bs and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy of efficacy in each study was the proportion of patients in which the last three month of a ser@@ um acid level was &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

the AP@@ EX study showed the statist@@ ically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80@@ mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed the statist@@ ically significant su@@ peri@@ ority for the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80@@ mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily with the conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the decrease of the ser@@ um gra@@ pe@@ ers on &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit during Week 2 and sustained permanently across the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um pancre@@ as &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al @-@ function restri@@ ction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function limits ( d. h .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficiency point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there was no clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to the percentage of response of the ser@@ um ret@@ inal concentration in subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um har@@ n@@ ic acid concentration ≥ 40 % / d@@ l. approx . 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the results collected in two years in the open extension study phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients were treated in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against a slide show ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the G@@ al no@@ od@@ al size , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the g@@ onal notes up to the month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long time extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
for healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma centr@@ ation time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at gradually increased to 120 mg dos@@ ed dos@@ ages .
for doses ranging between 120 mg and 300 mg , it is observed in AU@@ C , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multi@@ pl@@ ers dos@@ ages of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is 2.8 @-@ 3,2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant changes have been observed in the percentage decrease of the ser@@ um concentration , if this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ranges from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma connection of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to around 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary bond to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is reached via the concentration width that can be reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies at human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ abo@@ ites are formed primarily through CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 , and CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ ori@@ cur@@ on@@ ide is produced mainly by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mar@@ inated February , roughly 49 % of the dosage in the urine was found in the urine as un@@ altered Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , whose known oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones are frag@@ ile ) in women after men@@ opause , where there is a risk of a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or intake of other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamins ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie down after the first intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate and vitamin D3 may already be used in other medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from earlier studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing the vitamin D mirror .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the share of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated in patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , ( 11 % ) than those who were exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also indicated data that the al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is precisely the dose that is required for preventing bone loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bone or joints ) , const@@ ip@@ ation , di@@ ar@@ rho@@ e ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , ul@@ c@@ ass ( cer@@ eb@@ ox ) , ul@@ c@@ ass ( blind@@ ness ) , di@@ pped abdom@@ en ( blind@@ ness ) as well as suction .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D3 or one of the other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE can not be used .
it may not be applied in case of ill@@ nesses of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand up or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or intake of drugs ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamins ) for the day to take .
the following critics are to be followed in order to reduce the risk of mal@@ icious irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swallowed by the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • Pati@@ ents should not cr@@ ust the tablet in the mouth as a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not take effect before the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. p@@ ept@@ ile Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , can be given only under special caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ cer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al sei@@ z@@ tures , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( mostly were these vital and required a hospital listing ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms to point out on potential mal@@ op@@ al reactions , and the patients are supposed to susp@@ end symptoms or retro@@ spective pain or new or itself wor@@ sen@@ ed heart@@ burn , to obtain medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe ös@@ op@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or it after the occurrence of symptoms that point to a mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dos@@ ing instructions are passed to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .

no data is available , the hints , whether the ab@@ yss of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ ric therapy in patients who reduce the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis , reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis .
the clinical assessment of the treated doctor is significant for therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instru@@ cted to take it from the intake of a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning after they have noticed .
you shouldn &apos;t take two tablets that same day , but taking one tablet per week as originally planned for the schedule of the week .
other diseases that affect the mineral change ( such as vitamin D defic@@ iency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ os@@ us ) should also be treated equally at the beginning of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium additions , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may imp@@ air res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at if they are at the same time .
therefore , patients need to wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not performed , al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a multitude of commonly used drugs , without clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for application in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during the pregnancy or for l@@ act@@ ating women .

studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate the therapeutic equality of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate once weekly 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in one @-@ year multi @-@ core study of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate on bone mass and fra@@ cture in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of same design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the Fra@@ ktur intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in the Phase III studies , the mean inc@@ line of the BM@@ D were achieved with an al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate 10 mg / day in the relationship to plac@@ ebo after 3 years ( 8.8 % in the sp@@ ine ) , 5.@@ 9 % at the Fem@@ ur@@ h@@ als and 7.8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was a 48 % reduction in the plac@@ ebo group compared with plac@@ ebo ( 6.2 % ) compared to the plac@@ ebo group , one or several sp@@ inal frac@@ tures were achieved .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D from sp@@ ine and Tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to maintain ; also the BM@@ D of the Fem@@ ale and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and followed by 10 mg daily for either 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily administration of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new ver@@ te@@ fra@@ ction by 47 % ( an end@@ ron@@ ate 7.9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption demands on an intraven@@ ous reference dose came to the mean oral bio availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate at women 0.@@ 64 % for cans between 5 and 70 mg after n@@ igh@@ tly fasting and two hours before accept@@ ing a standardized breakfast .
the bio@@ availability also increased by approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % , when al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate had taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or during the day .
in healthy subjects the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily ) led to any clin@@ ically significant change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( rising in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 . distribution studies on rats revealed that al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate is distributed according to intraven@@ ous gift of 1 mg / kg in sof@@ tw@@ eigh@@ s , but quickly disper@@ sed into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After an intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , approximately 50 % of the radioactive substance were eliminated within 72 hours by urine , and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the cases .
according to intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was 71 ml / min and the system@@ ic Clear@@ ance is not over 200 ml / min .
al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in rats not over the acid or based transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not assumed that by humans the differenti@@ ation of other medicines is influenced by these transport systems .
res@@ or@@ ption for healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) amounted to vitamin D3 ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for healthy adult subjects ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for healthy adult subjects ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D3 29@@ 6,4 g / h / ml ( without consideration of the vitamin D3 @-@ D3 ) .
the average maximum concentration in ser@@ um ( C@@ max ) of vitamin D3 was 5,@@ 9 n@@ g / ml and median time until reaching the maximum ser@@ um concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
the liver formation of vitamin D3 is absorbed rapidly in the liver quickly to 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 and then in the kidney at 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 , the biolog@@ ically active form , is met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
disc@@ laim@@ er With the gift of radio@@ actively market vitamin D3 on healthy subjects the median differenti@@ ation of radio@@ activity in the urine decreased after 48 hours of 2.4 % , in the cases after 4 days 4,@@ 9 % .
characteristics with clinical trials showed that the proportion of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , which is not stored in bone , is quickly dischar@@ ged via the urine .
although there are no clinical data above it , the ren@@ al elim@@ ination of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate as in the animal experiments may also be reduced in patients with reduced ren@@ al function .
therefore , in patients with reduced ren@@ al function , a slightly increased stimulation of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate can be expected in bone ( see section 4.2 ) .

Ad@@ vag@@ raf is given adult patients to prevent kidney or liver transplan@@ tation in order to prevent the out@@ po@@ uring of transplan@@ tation by the immune system .
because T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company presented the results from earlier studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature .
in addition , results from a clinical study of 6@@ 68 patients with ren@@ al transplan@@ tation was submitted , whereby the application of Ad@@ vag@@ raf with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in has been compared .
main indi@@ an of efficacy was the number of patients in which transplan@@ t was adjusted after a treatment duration of one year ( by example examined , as often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a res@@ um@@ ption of the di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
moreover , more studies on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation was performed and examined , as Ad@@ vag@@ raf in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft taken by the body .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ tation cancer , this medicine should make changes or changes in immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposure of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , this may lead to transplan@@ tation or increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or super@@ immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes of the formulation or the regim@@ es should only be performed under the eng@@ aging control of an experienced medical device ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
following a switch to an alternative solution , a therapeutic drug may need to be carried out in order to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus remains unchanged .
the dose of Ad@@ vag@@ raf should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of ab@@ out@@ po@@ uring and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see below &quot; Recomm@@ end@@ ations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus view mirror should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , system@@ ic exposure was measured as t@@ ach@@ ting mirror , with both form@@ ulations in both kidney as well as in liver transplan@@ t patients .
careful and repeated controls of the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ c@@ rates are recommended during the first two weeks of transplan@@ tation under Ad@@ vag@@ raf to ensure adequate substance @-@ exposure in direct transplan@@ tation phase .
as T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus is a substance containing low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Ad@@ vag@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can take several days until ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the condition of the patients in the first postoperative period does not allow oral treatment of drugs , the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be applied intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) .
duration of the application for supp@@ ression of the transplan@@ tation must be maintained ; consequ@@ enti@@ ally , therefore , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
recommended Dos@@ age - kidney transplan@@ t proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation . the oral ad@@ vag@@ ant therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
other c@@ rate adjustments may be necessary , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabil@@ ising the patient after transplan@@ tation .
recommended Dos@@ age - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation . the oral ad@@ vag@@ ant therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
dos@@ ing recommendation - change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf need a gra@@ ft dose of daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ raf , this change@@ over in relation to a daily dose of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the whole daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ t after a change@@ over from other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ si@@ va on Ad@@ vag@@ raf once daily must begin treatment with the recommended starting dose for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the transplan@@ tation .
heart transplan@@ t at adult patients who are consumed on Ad@@ vag@@ raf is an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day daily taken in the morning .
other transplan@@ tation was probably no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ raf in an oral initial dose of 0,@@ 10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose custom@@ iz@@ ations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintenance of blood cells in the targeted range can be necessary in patients with severe liver function as a reduction in dose .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function The kidney function has no effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ otic potenti@@ als of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , a careful monitoring of ren@@ al function is recommended ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um control levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) .
change@@ over of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Ad@@ vag@@ raf On the change@@ over of a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ a to a T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advis@@ able ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the valley level in the whole blood The dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of ab@@ out@@ po@@ uring and toler@@ ability in individual cases using full @-@ blood @-@ T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus tab control .
it is recommended to perform common inspec@@ tions of the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus levels throughout the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ levels of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled even after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , Dos@@ is@@ adaptation , modifications of immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could be controlled ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Ad@@ vaginal sex is a drug with low mot@@ ance , adap@@ t@@ ations of the dose may require several days until ste@@ ady state has occurred .
the data in clinical trials should include that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the levels in the blood could not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the valley level of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus can be used in full blood in the first time according to liver transplan@@ tation in the area of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and near @-@ transplan@@ t patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the following maintenance therapy of liver , kidney , kidney transplan@@ tation , blood concentrations in the area of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were used .
this has led to severe adverse events including transplan@@ tation or other side effects that may occur in succession of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus sub@@ - or exposure .
patients should always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes of the formulation or the regim@@ es should only be performed under the eng@@ aging control of an experienced medical device ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ tation , which was proven to be treated with other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ is , there are no clinical data for ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation .
no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ raf left for ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of the transplan@@ tation .
due to possible interaction that may lead to a reduction of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mia in the blood and a decline in clinical effects of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus ( see Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant healing during treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ raf ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea is a particularly careful monitoring of the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus@@ - concentrations in the blood that the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subjected to substantial fluctu@@ ations under such conditions .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f performed a chamber or sept@@ um hyper@@ tro@@ ph@@ ie , which can therefore also occur under Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical dis@@ ru@@ ptions are an already existing cardi@@ ac disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function , infections , fluid valu@@ ation and oil .
like other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ si@@ va , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes by suitable clothing or using a high protection factor .

simultaneous use of medicines or medicinal therapies , which are known as hem@@ mer or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , can affect or decrease blood values of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus or decrease blood values of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus .
therefore , the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus@@ - blood levels therefore recommends to monitor , monitor and monitor the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism to monitor and adjust the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus dose for maintaining uniform concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .

pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels are mainly resulting from the elev@@ ated oral bio availability of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , due to the in@@ hibition of the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal trans@@ gression .
highly dos@@ ed Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute immune reactions , can increase or decrease concentration of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
effect of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus is known as CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; hence , the simultaneous application of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by CY@@ P3@@ A4 , which can imp@@ air your metabolism .
since T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus can minim@@ ize the clearing of ster@@ oid @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the hormon@@ al exposure , it is particularly careful in making decisions about anxi@@ ous prevention .
the results of animal experiments have shown that T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus can potentially decrease Clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and may pro@@ long their half @-@ time .

because of its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and plasma samples can be assumed that T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ zed .
effect mechanism and pharmac@@ ogen@@ o@@ dynamic effects on molecular level might be convey@@ ed by the effects of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ish protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the en@@ rich@@ ment of the connection in the cell cl@@ amps .

chronic transplan@@ tation was also triggered in the first year after the transplan@@ tation syndrome , which was less common in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .

the number of cases where Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.0@@ 2 ) than the number of patients who were surrounded by T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus on Cic@@ los@@ por@@ ine ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases in which there came to no acute transplan@@ tation was out@@ po@@ ised after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 3@@ 5.8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the transplan@@ ted patients of the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung transporter 2001 ; 20 : 511 ) .

factors such as a low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit@@ ate and low protein concentration that lead to an increase in the resulting fra@@ ction of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , or one by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , should be responsible for the higher clearing rates of the higher Clear@@ ance rates .

patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII @-@ defic@@ iency , which causes blood cl@@ ots like bleeding within the joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced by a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA &quot; :
it is produced by a cell which was introduced to a gene ( DNA ) which enables them to become the formation of the human right factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is a drug approved in the European Union called re@@ bin@@ ate , however , it is produced differently , so that the medicine does not contain protein human@@ eness or animal origin .
in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A , among them a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was investigated for the use of blood cells as well as surgical procedures .
in the primary study , the efficacy of adv@@ ances in the prevention of blood vessels in 86 % of 510 has been awarded with &quot; excellent &quot; and &quot; well &quot; .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observe at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies across factor VIII .
Adv@@ ance may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to the human scent factor VIII , mice or ham@@ ster protein or one of the other components .
from March 2004 , the European Commission granted the B@@ ax@@ ter AG company to provide an approval for the marketing of adv@@ ances in the whole of the European Union .
dosage : dosage and duration of subst@@ itution is determined according to the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ defic@@ iency , after the place and the extent of blood and the clinical condition of the patient .
on the following h@@ äm@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity should not drop under the given plasma level ( in % of the norm or in I.@@ U. / dl ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute attacks are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk is passed by the patient .
during treatment , it is stim@@ ulated to control the dose and the frequency of injec@@ tions an appropriate determination of the factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ mas@@ pie@@ gel .
individual patients may differ in response to factor VIII various in vi@@ vo recovery and have various se@@ mit@@ es times .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A should be given doses ranging between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ are cannot be achieved or if bleeding is not ruled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to prove another inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the sched@@ ules should be directed according to the patient &apos;s reference , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
formation of neutr@@ alis@@ ing anti@@ bodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in treating patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII and Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are qu@@ anti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma of modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
developing the risk of developing in@@ hibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk depends on the first 20 ex@@ positions at the largest , and depends on genetic and other factors .
in previously treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ ne@@ ically @-@ known inhibit@@ ors , after the conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII , the product may appear to another , re@@ occurrence of ( low @-@ sigh@@ ted ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A near women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s &apos;s largest number of patients ( 5 patients ) observed in the highest number of patients who were treated previously untreated patients experienced higher risk of formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very commonly ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 up to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 ) , very rare ( frequency on the basis of available data not in@@ valuable ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of each patient ( 234 ) the unexpected drop of the blood cl@@ oning factor VIII ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ able day ) in one patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE @-@ in@@ fusion .
during the whole time blood was uph@@ eld by the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values on the 15 postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE , 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostics of severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient ( ≥ 150 days ) showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , there was none of the 53 pap@@ al patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) to determine a F@@ VIII &apos;s inhibit@@ or .
previously , in previously treated patients of an ongoing clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated patients with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients against factor VIII .
patients in response of the patients on the trace of contam@@ inated proteins was analyzed by exam@@ ining the anti@@ bodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statist@@ ically significant upward trend in an anti @-@ Ch@@ o @-@ cell protein , but otherwise no sign or symptoms occurred which have occurred on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the occurrence of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hi@@ lic pom@@ u@@ lo@@ tes were reported in several repeated production positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE was reported to have hyper@@ sensitive reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated Factor VIII works as a co @-@ factor for the active factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of the active factor X out of factor X .
all of the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate H@@ äm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( basic value of factor VIII activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study using A@@ DV@@ ATE , previously treated in 100 patients , or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk reduction , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the safety filter of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , that the authorisation holder will apply another renewal case in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited shared the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for the Transport of Adv@@ oc@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , the breast , the brain , bones or soft tissues ( tissues , other structures in the body , surro@@ unds , and rests ) are affected .
it is a type of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; virus , it is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is so altered that there cannot be any copies of itself and thus no infections can trigger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
adv@@ in would have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ours and thus enable the cancer cells to re@@ build the normal p@@ 53 @-@ protein again .
the p@@ 53 @-@ protein , which is formed from the non @-@ defect in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , usually carries to rest@@ oring damage DNA and to destroy the cells when the DNA can &apos;t be restored .
when the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein does not work properly , and the p@@ 53 @-@ protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can grow further and share .
the company submitted data from a study involving one patient prior to the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of sub@@ tree , in the bones and the brain .
once the CH@@ MP has checked the questions posed by the company , some questions were still un@@ solved .
based on the initial documents prepared by the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP has a list of questions which will be sent to the company by day 120 .
according to CH@@ MP opinion , the injection of Adv@@ oc@@ in was not sufficiently demonstrated in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s tum@@ ours .
the committee had further concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration as well as the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not adequ@@ ately proven that Adv@@ oc@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company didn &apos;t inform the CH@@ MP if the return has consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ oc@@ in .
&quot; altered Ac@@ tual release &quot; means that the tablets are so comp@@ uted that one of the effective components is absorbed immediately and the other slowly over a few hours .
aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever , caused by allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ al swelling ( clo@@ gged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents 12 years old , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ aze twice daily is a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( clo@@ gged nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may be reli@@ eved with the block@@ age of the nose .
the main measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the h@@ ay fever symptoms that were reported by patients before the beginning of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
throughout the study patients carried out their symptoms all 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale as hard the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all h@@ ay fever symptoms , except the block@@ age of the nose , the patients who reported Aer@@ in@@ aze &apos;s income , over a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % compared to patients who p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine in revenues alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients showed a relief of 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % compared to the patients receiving des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
the most common adverse events of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observe at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are speed@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive against ab@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ chy agents or lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another drug to treat aller@@ gies ) .

on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted SP Europe to provide a permit for placing Aer@@ un@@ aze in the whole of the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , it is possible to swal@@ low in whole ( i.e. without scrat@@ ching them , breaking down or che@@ w ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be applied in children under the age of 12 because of the lack of data for in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is to be maintained as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms sound .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as with long term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine can take off at time .
after slow@@ ing down the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respir@@ atory tract , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as a mon@@ otherapy .
as Aer@@ in@@ aze p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with monogram oxid@@ ase ( Mao ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , per@@ go@@ lid , l@@ act@@ amine , erg@@ ot@@ amin , erg@@ ot@@ amin , erg@@ ot@@ amin , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , oxy@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of these combination therapy was not checked for this patient basis , and the data are not enough to discuss appropriate recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function , and the data are not enough to discuss appropriate recommendations .
the patients need to be informed that treatment in occurrence of hyper@@ tension or a speed@@ ometer , heart rhyth@@ mia , heart rhyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or et@@ w@@ ai@@ gen , other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a rein@@ forcement of head@@ aches ) .
in the treatment of following patient groups , patients suffering from heart rhyth@@ mia • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension attacks • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the history of diabetes , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bli@@ oph@@ thal@@ so@@ b@@ bin or bron@@ chos@@ pas@@ m in the history of history .
Aer@@ in@@ aze is present at least 48 hours prior to carrying out der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ amine can reduce positive reactions on indicators of skin reactions or reduce to the extent .
as part of clinical ex@@ ams with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , with which Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , however , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ otic tests there were no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and those treated with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone or with alcohol was taken .
the enzyme that is responsible for the abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was not yet identified , so that interaction with other medicines cannot be excluded entirely .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P3@@ A4 , and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ its and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .
however , the in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable application of aer@@ ob@@ aze during pregnancy is not secured , gained experience from a large number of affected pregnancy , and no increase in frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and the vas@@ o@@ on@@ strict properties of P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine should not be applied to aer@@ ob@@ aze in pregnancy .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that it can occur in very rare cases to conduct ben@@ om@@ men@@ ities , which may lead to imp@@ air@@ ment of the ability or ability to serve machines .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ a , dimin@@ ished cogn@@ itive concentration , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , heart rate col@@ lagen ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , st@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tu@@ als .

a CN@@ S stimulation is especially likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mou@@ th@@ dry , pup@@ il soli@@ di@@ zing , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the hibition of the infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human stem cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ en , as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhes@@ ion molec@@ ule P @-@ sel@@ ector to end@@ o@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes including the ampli@@ fication of subjective beats or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , there were no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo by the recommended dose of 5 mg daily .
the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further lik@@ om@@ ic effects such as an increase in blood pressure , a speed@@ ometer or manifestation of a CN@@ S ar@@ ous@@ al .
they participated in the age between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , whereby 4@@ 14 patients with Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets were obtained .
in both studies the hist@@ amine prot@@ agon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ ob@@ aze tablets , determines from the overall co@@ res for the symp@@ tom ( except nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ al swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze &apos;s tablets in relation to the swelling effect , determined by means of the nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ al swelling capacity , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ ob@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is present in the plasma within 30 minutes of administration .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ ob@@ aze with healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was reached in day 10 .
in the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dos@@ is@@ trial study , which was performed with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , it was noted that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in were badly damaged .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine after the sole gift of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was equivalent to the gift of an aer@@ ob@@ aze tablet .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated treatment , to gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ productive met@@ icity , however , the pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in have no particular dangers for human beings .
the combination possessed no greater tox@@ icity than its components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine .
in reproduction , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and to bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day not ter@@ at@@ ogenic .

it is available as 5 mg tablets , 5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg mel@@ an@@ ise tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for inser@@ tion .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1,@@ 25 m@@ g. a day , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup resp@@ .
for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup resp@@ .
A@@ eri@@ us has been studied in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( among them four trials in seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis and two studies on patients who also had asthma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quadru@@ ple , com@@ promising the sleep and performance of days ) before and after a six @-@ week treatment .
further studies were submitted to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application of children are harmless .
in case of allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us represents an average decrease of the Symp@@ tom ( symp@@ tom values ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the acceptance of 12 to 26 % in the patients who received a plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria the decrease of the symptoms after a six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , lau@@ at@@ ad@@ in or one of the other components .
January 2001 , the European Commission granted SP Europe to provide a permit for the marketing of a@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
a tablet once daily , with or without a meal , to relie@@ ve symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
there are restricted experience from clinical trials to effectiveness in the use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in for juven@@ iles from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week , or less than 4 weeks ) should be terminated according to the previous disease progres@@ sion and may be resumed after the termination of the symptoms .
in persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week , and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to the patient during the entire duration of a prolonged treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not found in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets , where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole have been administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , consuming A@@ eri@@ us and Alco@@ hol does not intensi@@ fy the effective effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that it can occur in very rare cases to conduct ben@@ om@@ men@@ ities , which can lead to imp@@ air@@ ment of the ability or ability to serve machines .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most common adverse events that were more common than in plac@@ ebo were ti@@ red@@ ness ( 1,2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 patients of 12 to 17 years the most common side effect of the head@@ ache has been treated with 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , with 6.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multiple @-@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( n@@ inet@@ een clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the hibition of the infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human stem cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ en , as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhes@@ ion molec@@ ule P @-@ sel@@ ector to end@@ o@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in the framework of a clinical study with multiple doses , administered in the ab@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ovascular effect was described .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the ab@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ interval .
in a single dos@@ e- trial with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes including the ampli@@ fication of subjective beats or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , a@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ ev@@ ing symptoms such as ni@@ zing , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , tr@@ ash and red@@ ness of eyes and it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis can be divided in dependence on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in an inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
an inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week , or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week , and more than 4 weeks .
as shown in the overall co@@ res of the quest@@ ionnaire to the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ished the load caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as a representative of other forms of urine , because the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology has been studied despite the surgical path@@ ology in the different forms and chronic patients can be easily recru@@ ited .
since the hist@@ amine @-@ release is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ tic@@ aria diseases , in addition , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is also confirmed in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in enhancing Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the decreasing of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose inter@@ v@@ alls .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amine with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria the minority of the patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines , were excluded from the study .
improvement of it@@ ching over 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
treatment with a@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of the sleep and of the wax important , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate this variable .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patient Dem@@ ograph@@ s were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis population , 4 % of patients had a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
there are no clu@@ es for a clin@@ ically relevant links after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , this enzyme was not yet identified for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , so that interaction with other drugs will not be excluded entirely .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in@@ hib@@ its not CY@@ P3@@ A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 in@@ hib@@ its and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .
in a single dos@@ sier study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in a dose of 7,5 mg , meals ( gre@@ asy , low @-@ oriented breakfast ) was not based on the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
the clinical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in showed a comparable degree of exposure from Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , no qualitative and quantitative differences in relation to the tox@@ icity fil@@ s of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated treatment , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ productive met@@ icity , the pre @-@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine have no particular dangers for human beings .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
the missing doctor should be aware that most cases of Rhin@@ itis are caused by infection with children under the age of 2 ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data exists , which support a treatment of inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
besides the exclusion of upper respir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis , physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and skin studies should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of li@@ ven@@ ti@@ zed des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in limited and experienced a higher sub@@ grade load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between the ages of 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed - is identical to the children that have been normal .
this medicine contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not use her@@ bic@@ ose in@@ tolerance , glucose f@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption or a Sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ in@@ suff@@ iciency of this medicine .
clinical relevant actions were not identified as part of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole have been given in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol was to intensi@@ fy the effective effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group like the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi@@ dose @-@ dose of adults and adolescents , given up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( n@@ inet@@ een clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children between 1 and 11 years old , who came into question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily dessert dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the process of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults can extra@@ pol@@ ated extra@@ pol@@ ated to children &apos;s population .
in the scope of a clinical study with multiple users in adults and adolescents , in the ab@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in a dose of up to 20 mg a day was applied daily for 14 days , no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the ab@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied more than ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ interval .
in controlled clinical trials , recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were used in adults and adolescents in clinical studies to not imp@@ air@@ ment of Psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies on adults , there was neither to increase alcohol induced by simultaneous use of alcohol induced or increase drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ es@@ cent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ ev@@ ing symptoms such as ni@@ zing , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , tr@@ ash and red@@ ness of eyes and it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
as shown in the overall co@@ res of the quest@@ ionnaire to the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets dimin@@ ished effectively the car@@ cases of rhin@@ itis .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in enhancing Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the decreasing of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose inter@@ v@@ alls .
the spread of this fully met@@ abo@@ lically phen@@ otyp@@ s was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than for Cau@@ cas@@ ians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study with Sir@@ up@@ form@@ ulation of children between 2 and 11 years of allergic rhin@@ itis , which is fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
the burden ( AU@@ C ) through Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was about 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a scheduled half @-@ time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications of a clinical @-@ relevant active ingredient Cum@@ ulation for once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days with adults and adolescents .
12 In various individual @-@ dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in showed at the recommended doses with those of adults who received the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , this enzyme could not be identified for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , so that interaction with other medicines cannot be excluded entirely .

June 2008 Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. granted the committee for humanitarian law ( CH@@ MP ) that the company with@@ draws his application for authorization of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 virus in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ in@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people for the protection against flu , caused by the strain ( Type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 virus ( flu ) virus .
this is a special type of vaccine , which could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic to protect future pan@@ de@@ mic .
an influ@@ enza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out if a new strain of the flu can easily spread by man because people still have no imm@@ unity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system contained the parts of the influ@@ enza virus in the vaccine as &quot; physically alien &quot; and forms anti@@ bodies against it .
this makes the immune system later in a position to make contact with a Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus of this Stam@@ ms rapid anti@@ bodies .
after that , the virus base of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which det@@ ects the human body as a foreign body ) , was taken up , cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine .
an inspec@@ tions of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; Good Clinical Practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this meant the extent of the clinical data base for the evaluation of the safety of the vaccine is not designed to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are taking part in a clinical trial and need further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor &apos;s doctor .
if you want further information regarding the CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are caused by the human immun@@ ode@@ fic@@ iency syndrome ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which causes the acquired immun@@ ode@@ fic@@ iency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ generic ase is available as a solution to intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the security of this combination was not examined .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed by the doctor , if the doctor has checked the an@@ tivir@@ al drug of the patient , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of thought that the virus is addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs daily .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended adult dose is aimed at the body weight .
A@@ g@@ ase reduces the HIV @-@ amount in the blood while taking in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs them at a low level .
AIDS is not to be healed , however , the damage of the immune system , and the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who previously had not been treated with ease .
the drug A@@ ha@@ ase increased with low dose , was compared with 206 adults who previously used prot@@ ease of prot@@ ease .
main indi@@ an for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ ability ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who previously had not used prot@@ ease , they had more patients a viral load under 400 copies / ml as under plac@@ ebo but a@@ generating ase was less effective than inn@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ ha@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but were treated by the children who used to treat previously with prot@@ ease , only very few in the treatment .
in the study with adults who used to treat previously with prot@@ ease , the drug ad@@ v@@ ase increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease :
in the patients with HIV that was resistant to four other prot@@ ease , it came under A@@ ha@@ ase , together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger fall of the viral load after four weeks than in the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or :
the most common adverse events of A@@ ha@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , Nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , rash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ mon@@ ase may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ ha@@ ase can also not be applied in patients , the cur@@ rants ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are equally re@@ min@@ ed as v@@ ec@@ ase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood health .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who are taking A@@ ha@@ ase , the risk of a lique@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( alter@@ ations in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ opor@@ osis ( sever@@ ance of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ in@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection caused by itself ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ generic drug in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs are used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee stated that the benefit of v@@ ec@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously no prot@@ ease of prot@@ ease is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ generic ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited for marketing purpose of inter@@ v@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ generic ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ previously treated adults and children 4 years and older .
for usually A@@ mon@@ ase capsules to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ths are given at Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r should take place considering the individual viral resistance and pre@@ treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ tion is 14 % lower than the result of Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r . therefore , A@@ generic ase capsules and a solution are not inter@@ changeable with milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for v@@ ec@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If a@@ generators can be applied without the enhanced addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sted ) , higher doses should be applied to v@@ ec@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for v@@ ec@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ can@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of v@@ ec@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ eases were not examined in children .
A@@ generic ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data for in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose to A@@ generic drugs should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function faul@@ ts to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous application should be treated in patients with mild or moderate liver function , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ g@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with drugs , which have a small therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ unding ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations which contain St John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may be used due to the risk reduction in plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ generic ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy cannot lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with v@@ ec@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transfer@@ ring HIV to other by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic hepat@@ itis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combined therapy , have increased risk of severe liver inter@@ actions with potentially fatal accidents .
for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepat@@ itis B or C , please read the information contained in the medicine .
patients with pre@@ existing hepat@@ itis function , including a chronic hepat@@ itis optic , show an increased frequency of liver function in anti@@ retro@@ viral combined therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of A@@ generic ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ oc@@ or@@ tic acid , which is mistaken for CY@@ P3@@ A4 , is not recommended that the possible use of a treatment is overweight and Supp@@ ression of the associated gland &apos;s function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
because the nutri@@ ent change of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or is highly dependent on CY@@ P3@@ A4 , is not recommended for administration of an ast@@ er@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin because of the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( among monitoring the International norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , are methods to determine active concentration .
in patients who take these medicines at the same time , A@@ ha@@ ase can be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
because of the possibility of met@@ abolic interaction with Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be changed , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interaction .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ iat@@ ent@@ tor@@ ments , in particular if also low doses should also be given to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the possible risk of tox@@ icity of tox@@ icity as a result of the high Prop@@ yl English solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain patient groups .
A@@ g@@ ase should be removed in duration 5 if a rash occurs in system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
patients who received a anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease , was reported about the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exc@@ itation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other ill@@ nesses that were necessary to cure drugs with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and drug dependent factors , such as continuous anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders associated with it .
patients were treated in hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) who were treated with prot@@ ease , are reports on an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ ic@@ thro@@ es .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ otherapy ( ART ) , an infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory reaction to as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or re@@ mod@@ al opportun@@ istic infection can develop to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ tor@@ ial ae@@ ti@@ ology is taken ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis were reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combined therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of a@@ generators may not be given simultaneously with drugs , which have a small therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ unding ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of v@@ ec@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with drugs , whose agents are primarily associated with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 which are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it was shown that R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C from Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a le@@ ast@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to resist@@ ence development .
attemp@@ ting to compens@@ ate a plasma level by a dose of other prot@@ ease @-@ inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often unwanted effects on the liver were observed .
St John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirror of Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r can be degra@@ ded by the simultaneous application of vegetable preparations with cur@@ rants ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient takes already cur@@ rants , the Am@@ bur@@ n@@ ir@@ anlage are , and , if possible to check the viral load and depos@@ ed the St. John &apos;s wort .
a dose adaptation for one of the drug is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r ( see also e@@ av@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
508 % increased , for C@@ max it decreased by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
in clinical studies , dos@@ ages of 600 mg Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily apply twice daily to prove the effectiveness and in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable of the treatment schem@@ as .
52 % degra@@ ded when Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) can be reached twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ on@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
dos@@ ing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended for a tight surveillance , as the effectiveness and in@@ comprehen@@ si@@ veness of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic study carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the ant@@ acid component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and as@@ v@@ ase are at least one hour apart . ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da bottom ) .
this is why the gift of ef@@ av@@ ir@@ enz is required in combination with Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
the treatment with ef@@ av@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposition of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would drift .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ eases and existing data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may be sun@@ k in the ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r .
in case these medicines should be used simultaneously , caution is advis@@ able because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level .
when these medicines are used together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rology @-@ monitoring has to be performed as a precise forecast on the effects of the combination of Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r and R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in resulted in an increase in plasma concentration of 193 % , resulting in an increase in the side effects associated with R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in is administered jointly with A@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data exists .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with v@@ ase in combination with Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin , however , could not be increased the plasma level of both medicines in case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole on a daily dose of 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in the plasma around 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 ) to 2.@@ 69@@ fold in comparison to the value that was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous use of f@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , may be used together with A@@ generic ase , possibly to interact with inter@@ actions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions which are linked to these drugs if they are used in combination with v@@ ec@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
based on the data of other prot@@ eases , it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ azi@@ da can not be taken at the same time as v@@ ec@@ ase , as it can cause res@@ or@@ ption distur@@ ban@@ ces .
simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ can@@ va , which are known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ can@@ avi@@ r can lead to a lower plasma level of Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r .
the ser@@ um concentration of calcium block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , thick@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ o@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ o@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ o@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ o@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by 10 through Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r , thus reducing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
the simultaneous intake of v@@ ec@@ ase can increase considerably their plasma concentration and intensi@@ fy P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in combination with p@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ ension , optic nerve and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules daily , with 50 µ@@ g flux prop@@ ion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) , the fluor@@ o@@ on@@ prop@@ ion@@ ate plasma level increased significantly , while the end@@ ogen@@ ous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol increased by about 86 % ( 90 % con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ inter@@ v@@ all 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended that the potential benefit of a treatment is overweight ( see section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , the nutri@@ ent varies greatly from CY@@ P3@@ A4 , are projected to increase the plasma level with con@@ current administration .
since plasma performance increases this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or , including a sh@@ ab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended with Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r .
there is a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as recommended for stabil@@ ising the mirror , as the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus can be increased at the simultaneous gift of Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ ha@@ ase cannot be applied together with or@@ ally filed Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while with the con@@ current use of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ ic mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution .
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ ic mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other lung hibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am 3 to 4 @-@ fold .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is given to Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r together with Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ iat@@ ent@@ tor@@ ments , in particular if also low doses should also be given to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the minimal reliability of historic compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation to be given , if Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on at the same time .
with con@@ current gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ glaucoma , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a decrease or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predic@@ table , therefore alternative methods are recommended for contrac@@ eption .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ til@@ in ) is recommended for the con@@ current gift of v@@ ec@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy only after a careful consideration of the possible use for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk of lac@@ tic rats , Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r @-@ related compounds were detected , however , it is not known whether Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r is overwhel@@ med in people in breast milk .
a re@@ productive study of toler@@ ated rats who was given from the ni@@ dation in the uter@@ us to the end of the nur@@ sing time Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of the 12 body weight during the lac@@ tation .
the further development of the seed , including the fertility and re@@ productive capacity was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r .
the in@@ conc@@ ei@@ veness of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ fra@@ ase treatment were mild to moder@@ ately and performed very rarely to the treatment of treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clear if they are used to treat v@@ ec@@ ase or other medicines at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the disease .
most of the side @-@ mentioned side effects originate from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients treated with prot@@ eases the 1200 mg of A@@ mon@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) performed by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication , and were performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as the treatment performed ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
the anti@@ retro@@ viral combined therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peri@@ pher@@ als and su@@ peri@@ pher@@ ical tissue , hyper@@ trophy and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ ph@@ ie of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ v@@ ical fat accum@@ ulator .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral anti @-@ average people who had been treated with Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / Z@@ id@@ ov@@ ud@@ ine over a medium term of 36 weeks , only one case was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients with 59 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a median duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
skin rash typically had mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ atic or mac@@ u@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ary nature , with or without it@@ ching and appeared during the second treatment week and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks without causing the treatment with Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r .
cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose have been reported particularly in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combined therapy ( ART ) .
in the time of the introduction of an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combined therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected combination therapy ( ART ) can become an infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory reaction to as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre@@ treated patients , which were observed twice daily with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the incidence of the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and CP@@ H @-@ values ( Grade 3 to 4 ) were observed in patients who received ag@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and CP@@ R values in patients who received ag@@ glomer@@ ates together with low do@@ si@@ re Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dose the patient is subject to signs of an in@@ tox@@ ication ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures to be introduced .
Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active core of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the proc@@ ession of viral g@@ ag@@ - and G@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ y as a result of a formation of irrit@@ ated , not inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous viral particles .
the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bl@@ astic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % in@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M for chronic in@@ infected cells .
the relationship between the activity of Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r on HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages have been observed - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r given treatment schem@@ as , the mut@@ ations described only rarely .
at the sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of b@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ ca@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ad@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred throughout the week 48 with which 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ed .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 from 14 children , with whom a vi@@ ro@@ logic failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ eases did not occur in previously treated patients , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 36@@ I , M@@ 36@@ I , M@@ 46@@ V , M@@ 46@@ V , I@@ 54@@ A , I@@ 62@@ V , I@@ 62@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85 V , I@@ 9@@ V , I@@ 9@@ V , I@@ 9@@ V , and I@@ 93@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 0@@ ( 700 mg of b@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) with prot@@ ease of patients demonstrated in patients with vi@@ ro@@ rolog@@ ical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease of ease :
on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance tests , the Gen@@ otyp@@ ical inter@@ pret@@ ational systems can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with ease @-@ resistant insulation systems .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defined resistance as the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / C / F / M / M / M / M / M , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ V , with a reduced chance of vi@@ ro@@ intestinal response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations can be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to always move the current inter@@ pret@@ ational systems analysis of resistance tests .
on phenom@@ enal resistance tests , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ational systems can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for the estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease of inhibit@@ ors .
companies which exp@@ el diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( divider ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to evaluate results of resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r associated gen@@ ial patterns creates a certain cross@@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r but generally preserved .
there is currently data for cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r and other lung failure to all 4 F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resist@@ ence , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , a limited @-@ resistance to Lop@@ ar avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 Isol@@ ate ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 Isol@@ ate ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 Isol@@ ate ) , quin@@ ine avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 Isol@@ ate ) and Tip@@ avi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 Isol@@ ate ) and a Tip@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 Isol@@ ate ) .
in reverse , Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease of ins@@ ulator ; the receipt of these activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early departure of a different therapy is recommended to keep accumulation of a multitude of mut@@ ations in boundaries that can affect the subsequent treatment .
the proof of efficacy of v@@ ec@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which with PI pre@@ treated adults ( 100 mg twice daily ) and a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with lowest kn@@ ights .
one hundred and six@@ ty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I have been included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis provided the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI Group in the plasma time ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma time ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ under@@ lining non@@ threshold of 0,4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the effectiveness of un@@ born v@@ eins is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in studies , A@@ generic ase solution to intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg was examined three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , and 2@@ mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low @-@ dos@@ ed kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously obtained at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s combined with A@@ ha@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD@@ 4 cells of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Bas@@ ed on this data should be considered as expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ ec@@ ase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration the median duration ( T@@ max ) up to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
a maximum of 508 % increases for C@@ max at 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r 12 hours to dose ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) of food intake remained un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous intake of absorption affects the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ ted penetration of Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream flowing into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the concentration in the plasma , whereby the amount of untreated Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r , which is likely to remain unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of untreated Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients during the dos@@ ing inter@@ v@@ alls in dependence of the total pharmaceutical concentration in the ste@@ ady state via the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs have to present or in@@ hibit the CY@@ P3@@ A4 or given a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P3@@ A4 if they are given with caution ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ ha@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r exposure , such as adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r is less bio@@ available in the solution containing 14 % less bio@@ available than the capsules ; so v@@ ec@@ ase solution and v@@ ec@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram@@ m@@ base .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a kidney disease is likely to be minor on the elim@@ ination of Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
this treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r plasma screens comparable to that of healthy volunteers according to a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on the can@@ cer@@ ogen@@ icity with can@@ on@@ oids on mice and rats , male animals named o@@ cellular aden@@ oma during doses increased to 2.0 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r , dec@@ eased .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ p@@ ic aden@@ omes and car@@ cin@@ omas has not been resolved and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects is un@@ clear .
however , some evidence for the adoption of a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings were made from the current exposure data by people , both from clinical studies and for therapeutic use .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in vitro Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests , micro@@ core testing of rats and chromosome deriv@@ atives of human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic neither mut@@ agen@@ ic , nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and documented in clinical everyday life by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now , clinical studies have not observed no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients , neither by the end of treatment .
studies on the tox@@ icity at young animals , which were treated with an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality with the control and the Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r @-@ treated animals .
at a system@@ ic plasma exposure , which significantly reduced ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dose when humans was , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus @-@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which point to a delayed development .
24 If eye @-@ v@@ ase capsules are applied without the reinforced additi@@ ve of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sted ) , higher doses should be applied to v@@ ec@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for v@@ ec@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ can@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous application should be treated in patients with weak or light liver function , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( among monitoring the International norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , are methods to determine active concentration .
A@@ g@@ ase should be removed in duration 27 if a rash occurs in system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
increased risk of a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug addic@@ ts factors such as a longer continuous anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it was shown that R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C from Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a le@@ ast@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to resist@@ ence development .
508 % increased , for C@@ max it decreased by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) can be reached twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ on@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
dos@@ ing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended for a tight surveillance , as the effectiveness and in@@ comprehen@@ si@@ veness of this combination is not known .
the treatment with ef@@ av@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposition of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would drift .
when these medicines are used together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rology @-@ monitoring has to be performed as a precise forecast on the effects of the combination of Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in is expected to take up with A@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data exists .
the ser@@ um concentration of calcium block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , thick@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ o@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ o@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ o@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ o@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r , whereby the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine may be increased .
in a clinical study , in the kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules daily , with 50 µ@@ g flux prop@@ ion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) , the fluor@@ o@@ on@@ prop@@ ion@@ ate plasma level increased significantly , while the end@@ ogen@@ ous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol increased by about 86 % ( 90 % con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ inter@@ v@@ all 82 to 89 % ) .
with con@@ current gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ glaucoma , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a decrease or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of No@@ re@@ th@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy only after a careful consideration of the possible use for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
a re@@ productive study of toler@@ ated rats who was given from the ni@@ dation in the uter@@ us to the end of the nur@@ sing time Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during feeding .
the in@@ conc@@ ei@@ veness of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dose the patient is subject to signs of an in@@ tox@@ ication ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures to be introduced .
the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bl@@ astic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % in@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M with chronic in@@ infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
in reverse , Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease of ins@@ ulator ; the receipt of these activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , the treatment of &quot; un@@ bund@@ able &quot; A@@ mon@@ ase &quot; should be considered with PI pre@@ treated children .
while the absolute concentration of untreated Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients during the dos@@ ing inter@@ v@@ alls in dependence of the total pharmaceutical concentration in the ste@@ ady state via the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , drugs have to present or in@@ hibit the CY@@ P3@@ A4 or given a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P3@@ A4 if they are given with caution ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neglec@@ ted ; therefore the effect of kidney function is likely to be minor on the elim@@ ination of Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on the can@@ cer@@ ogen@@ icity with can@@ on@@ oids on mice and rats , male animals ben@@ ign@@ ant aden@@ oma in doses increased to 2.0 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ p@@ zel@@ ul@@ ary Aden@@ ome and Kar@@ cin@@ omas has not been resolved and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects is un@@ clear .
however , some evidence for the adoption of a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings were made from the current exposure data by people , both from clinical studies and for therapeutic use .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in vitro Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests , micro@@ core testing of rats and chromosome deriv@@ atives of human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic neither mut@@ agen@@ ic , nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on the tox@@ icity at young animals , which were treated with an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality with the control and the Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r @-@ treated animals .
these results suggest that in young , the metabolism of the Met@@ abol@@ isation are not fully mature , so that Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of formulation ( z ) .
A@@ stri@@ ase solution for use is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ previously treated adults and children 4 years and older .
the benefit of the use of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; A@@ generic ase &quot; solution was neither treated with PI @-@ treated patients nor with PI @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ tion is 14 % lower than the result of Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r . therefore , A@@ generic ase capsules and a solution are not inter@@ changeable with milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the patients should if they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , with taking the solution to intake . ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for v@@ ec@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2800 mg Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
additionally , there must be no dose of dose for simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to in@@ hibit and low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided this combination with these patient groups .

the treatment of the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , lips , or the hair@@ line was not studied .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of this reaction decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème .
when necessary due to the complaints of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reaction , treatment will be made several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after re@@ generation of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the treatment .
there is currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months following treatment , should be drawn in super@@ vis@@ ional Bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs have no clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in previously untreated tum@@ ours .
data from an open clinical trial indicate that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has not been studied for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or on the eye @-@ area within the eye .

the available data on the acute ker@@ at@@ ose on the fore@@ arms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this use case , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions normally take on intensity in the course of therapy or go back after lower@@ ing the therapy with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème .
if the local skin reactions of the patient may cause great dis@@ comfort or very strong , treatment may be suspended for several days .
from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 countries have indicated a lower healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for patients with a protection diagnosis of a mu@@ d@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ outlet I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase defic@@ iency ) to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that do not relate to brain or ner@@ ves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ ca@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ kan@@ e , g@@ ags ) are not de@@ min@@ ed and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage it .
the following non @-@ neurolog@@ ical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : increased liver , st@@ iff joints , pen@@ gu@@ ised lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor that possesses experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or hospital with re@@ vit@@ ational equipment , and patients need appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction .

in the study mainly the safety of the drug was studied , but it was measured also its effectiveness ( by reducing its effect regarding the reduction of G@@ ag concentrations in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years of age , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed the G@@ ag concentrations in the urine by approximately 60 % , and half of the treated children had a normal liver on the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , ar@@ thr@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gic ( joint pain ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions on the fusion station .
very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , speed@@ ometer ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ and@@ fro@@ st .

the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who are ob@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in regard to the reactions to the in@@ fusion and development of anti@@ bodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for marketing purposes of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , derived from the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is inde@@ xed to the long @-@ term enzymes in patients with a mu@@ d@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ outlet I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase defic@@ iency ) to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place through a doctor , the experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ al@@ al met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 e / kg / h can be increased , if the patient is able to increase all 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended for these patients .
safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined , and no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect , which occur during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , particularly these patients should also continue to be monitored closely , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be available in an appropriate clinical environment in which re@@ vit@@ ational facilities for medical emergen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical Phase 3 study , nearly all patients Ig@@ G @-@ anti@@ bodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are usually formed within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop anti@@ bodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when treating Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
since little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment following a longer inter@@ ruption , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk campaign must be careful after a break in treatment .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or antibiot@@ ics ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurrence in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of mild or in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate , in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ conditioned reaction the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are decreased , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resumed with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate when the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interference with intra@@ cellular absorption of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
experimental studies are not caused by direct or indirect damage to pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exported to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via breast milk , is recommended to not satisfy during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the effects of clinical trials were classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase @-@ 3- study and their extension in a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respir@@ atory and lungs in the past , severe reactions were carried out on , including bron@@ chos@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ atory and facial ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ er@@ desired drug actions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which have been reported during a phase 2 study involving a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with greater severe exp@@ iry and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 e / kg intraven@@ ously at once a weekly , 200 e / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients this occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a Serbian version , whereby the patients aged under 5 years with a heavy digest@@ ive form came mostly within one month to a ser@@ oc@@ on@@ version ( average after 26 days over 45 days in patients at age 5 and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 study ( or until a premature retirement from the study ) , there were no antibody in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say , pro@@ ver@@ sive anti@@ bodies , among them 3 patients who had never been too ser@@ oc@@ on@@ version .
patients with a failed to low anti@@ um mirror had a robust reduction in the G@@ ag mirror in the Har@@ n while in patients with high antibody tit@@ ers had a variable decrease of G@@ ag in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal to low neutr@@ alis@@ ing effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- Activity in vitro , which seemed to affect clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of G@@ ag in the Har@@ n .
the presence of anti@@ bodies seemed not to stand associated with the incidence of undes@@ irable drug reactions , although the occurrence of unwanted drug reactions typically wor@@ r@@ ying with the formation of Ig@@ G anti @-@ anti@@ bodies .
the reason for the enzyme is in one for hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the cum@@ ulative sub@@ str@@ ates and the reduction of further accumulation of the enzyme .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the cycle and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , the most prob@@ able about Mann@@ i @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study enrolled in 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients were reported from the mean phen@@ otype , and only one patient had the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a for@@ c@@ ised exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the actual FE@@ V and the absolute contents in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated a improvement in the lung function and the in@@ ability that is shown in the following table .
in the open extension study , an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects last up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows in the following table .
the decrease of the lower percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant over this period clin@@ ically and the absolute lung volume increased further propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a hepat@@ oma class before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) had reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
in the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of the G@@ ag @-@ mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was determined , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in regard to the hetero@@ gene@@ ous clinical experience between patients suffering from combined end points , clin@@ ically significant changes were summar@@ ised in a 6 @-@ minute walk , which was observed in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a single @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which primarily the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe slip form and 4 with the middle slip form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased because of increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in the har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 e / kg .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with a severe mental development speed had a normal mental development speed which only limited to the older patients with severe de@@ bit@@ al form only limited or no adv@@ ances in cogn@@ itive development .
in a phase 4 study investigations of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dos@@ ing schem@@ ata were carried out on the G@@ ag @-@ mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 e / kg intraven@@ ously at once a weekly , 200 e / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 e / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be seen in patients who have trouble with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , representing an alternative alternative ; however , is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ ata is equivalent .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( another drug against cancer ) if the cancer is not eradi@@ cated ( can not be removed ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( by an operation alone cannot be removed ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( by an operation alone cannot be removed ) . • Adv@@ oc@@ ative or metastatic &quot; non @-@ cell lung cancer that attacks not the squ@@ ad epithel@@ ium .
A@@ lim@@ ta is treated in patients who had previously not been treated previously , in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who previously already received other chemical therap@@ ists , as sole therapy .
to reduce side effects , patients should be taken with ag@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and receive injec@@ tions of vitamin B12 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , should also be given an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid defic@@ iency ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients whose blood count changes or during which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be suspended , removed or reducing the dose .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ed s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to divide .
the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ed into its active form is easier to fit in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active agent in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ thel@@ i@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a primary study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously had not received any chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local progressive or metastatic disease that previously had previously been treated with chemotherapy ( one other drug against cancer ) were compared .
A@@ lim@@ ta also was compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , while both in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and c@@ is@@ plat@@ in lived for an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.3 months during the sole administration of Cis@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who previously received chemotherapy first , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months compared to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , in which the cancer was not attacked the record epithel@@ ium , the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta increased survival times than with the drug treatment .
in September 2004 , the European Commission agreed to join the Company Eli L@@ illy Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for marketing services in the whole of the European Union .
each water bottle must be dissolved with 4.@@ 2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a 25 mg / ml solution .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - S@@ IS is taken from the water bottle and diluted with 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in for first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or m@@ CR@@ C non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .

the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after finishing the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial car@@ cin@@ oma following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
the reduction of frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions must be given on the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift as well as the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ ost@@ ero@@ id .
during the seven days before the first dose P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid and the intake must be continued during the entire duration of therapy as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage .
patients must also receive in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) during the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after each third session cycle .
in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ed should be created before each gift a complete blood count , including a differenti@@ ation of leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a ro@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te story .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose verification must take place under consideration of the N@@ adi@@ d of blood images or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the previous therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which apply to AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C level 2 blood flow .
patients should develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ mach ( apart from neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted by AL@@ IM@@ TA , until the patient under@@ takes the value before treatment .
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA needs to be can@@ cel@@ ed if patients after 2 can reduce hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity grade 3 or 4 or higher at the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical trials showed no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or above , in comparison to patients at age 65 , an increased by @-@ in@@ effective risk @-@ ko exists .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use with children under the age of 18 because of not sufficient data for the in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and effectiveness .
in clinical trials , patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min are not necessary to go out regarding the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data position in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function limit of &gt; 1.5 times of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limits and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values ( with abl@@ eness of liver metast@@ asis ) or &gt; 5,0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( with presence of liver metast@@ asis ) is not specifically studied in studies .
patients need to be monitored in patients with regard to the bone @-@ market supp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is not given to patients before the absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ oid again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ press has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on N@@ adir of absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ oid , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity as they were observed in the preceding treatment cycles - ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 ugly and non @-@ ni@@ th@@ ological tox@@ icity such as Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie and infection with Grade 3 / 4 Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was observed , if a pre@@ treatment had taken place with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 .
all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ed must apply fol@@ ate , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic approach to the reduction of disease @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) , the simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ oid antibiot@@ ic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) must avoid for at least 2 days before the therapy , at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients , intended for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs in a long half @-@ time treatment for a minimum of 5 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients with which these events occurred , appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including dehy@@ dr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
for patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid intake in the trans@@ forming space a drainage of eff@@ u@@ ation before P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment is to be considered .
5 serious cardi@@ ovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported occasionally in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ed live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .

since there is no data regarding the interaction potential of N@@ SA@@ IDs in a long marine time like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ ag@@ stimul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ y chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , when the decision was taken to treat patients with oral anti@@ glaucoma .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - an@@ timet@@ abol@@ ites are expected serious birth defects in the pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary and after a careful consideration of the use for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to re@@ productive capacity , men ought to be pointed out before the treatment began to take consultation with regard to the barriers .

since the weight reduction in diabetes may be involved with an improved met@@ abolic control , patients should consult a drug against diabetes before the beginning of a therapy with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist if necessary to adjust the dosage of anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tic .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or higher cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to prevent additional fluctu@@ ating measures in order to prevent the prevention of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on inter@@ actions of drugs as well as in several cases with the simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a reduction of Cic@@ lo@@ in plasma plasma .
when using war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ glaucoma in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( internationally standar@@ dised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) .
in most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ins are in normal operation .
however , patients should be recommended before bed@@ time an additional mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin should be taken to ensure a sufficient amount of vitamins ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a starting dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers , who received or@@ list@@ at simultaneously , a minor decrease of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration .
experimental studies showed no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , as the absorption of an assumed fat is avoided .
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal effects were determined in clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
number of times are defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data not in@@ valuable ) .
the incidence of known side effects that were determined after the launch of or@@ list@@ at , is not known because these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain size .
+ It is plau@@ sible for treatment with all@@ i to keep silent in regards to possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered to normal and overweight patients over a period of 15 days without any significant clinical findings .
in majority of cases reported by or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose cases , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on research on human and animal , a quick re@@ formation of any system@@ ic effect can be attributed to the li@@ ve@@ able properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect is placed in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonds to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ ni@@ otic lid .
clinical trials was derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at taken three times a day , which blocks absor@@ bing of about 25 % of the food source .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies on adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 shows the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ the@@ tical , fat @-@ prolifer@@ ated diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial condition ( at the time of mar@@ g@@ inal condition ) , has been judged as follows : as a result of the body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as percentage of those study participants who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their weight loss ( Table 2 ) .
though in both studies the weight reduction was observed more than 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average alter@@ ation in the overall chol@@ est@@ erin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial booking value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
for the wa@@ ist circum@@ ference , the average change was 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting with 10@@ 3,7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo @-@ 3.6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concentration of non met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ ur@@ able 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg of or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , therapeutic dos@@ ages could not be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in plasma only spor@@ adi@@ c and in extreme low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.0@@ 2 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of an sor@@ ulation .
in a study involving adi@@ p@@ ous patients , whom minim@@ ally system@@ ic res@@ or@@ ated dose could be administered , i.e. M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ l@@ ysi@@ erter Lac@@ ton ring ) and M3 ( M1 after the folding of the N @-@ Form@@ yl @-@ Leu@@ cin group ) , they identified nearly 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on the conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated treatment , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , can@@ cer@@ ogen@@ ous potential and re@@ productions , the pre @-@ clinical data can be no particular danger to humans .

the most common side effects depend on the mode of action of capsules , resulting in excess fat from the body .
these side effects usually appear within the first weeks of treatment , since you may have not been consistently reduced the fat content in diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minim@@ ize the nutritional @-@ related accompanying symptoms . • Learn more about the normal fat content of your favorite foods and the size of the portions that you usually take to yourself .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the probability that you exceed your excess limits . • Share up your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a low @-@ rich Main Local Court or a substantial noc@@ tur@@ nal pleasure . • Most people with whom these accompanying symptoms occur , they learn how to control their diet .
• Keep the drug for children in@@ accessible . • Do not apply only after the exp@@ iry date specified in the box , to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel , which serve to dry the capsules dry .

overweight has influence on your health and increases the risk of the emergence of various severe ill@@ nesses such as : • high blood pressure • diabetes • cer@@ eb@@ ral disease • oste@@ o@@ arthritis comes with your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
a permanent weight loss , for example , by improving nutrition and more movement , can prevent severe ill@@ nesses and has a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and learn to eat permanent healthy .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ oules , which you will also find as an indication of the packaging of food . • The recommended calculation of cal@@ orie intake is how many calories you should take a maximum of each day .
note the tables below in this section below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with every meal .
what is suitable for you , see the below information that gives the number of calories that is suitable for you . • Due to effect of effect of the capsule is the observ@@ ance of the recommended fat intake .
if you take the same amount of fat like so far , this can mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat .
by keeping the recommended fat intake , you can reduce weight loss and reduce the chance of nutritional @-@ related accompanying symptoms . • You should try to gradually increase gradually .
34 These low cal@@ orie intake should enable you to gradually lose around 0.5 kg a week of weight without ne@@ eding frustr@@ ations and disappoin@@ t@@ ments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the more active you are , the higher the recommended cal@@ orie intake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; low physical activity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that you burn daily 150 kcal daily , for example by 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Alo@@ xi is used in chemical therap@@ ies which are strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( like Cis@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as in chemical therapy , the excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased through the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug which can be used as anti@@ em@@ tics ) .
the application of patients under the age of 18 is not recommended since the effects in this age group do not have enough information .
this means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy regim@@ ens which are strong or moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
in chemotherapy , severe tri@@ ggers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi had no vom@@ iting ( 132 by 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron patients ( 126 of 221 ) .
in chemotherapy , excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi had no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 153 from 189 ) , compared with 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 from 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 , the European Commission granted Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd , a permit for the transportation of Alo@@ xi in the whole of the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer illness .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevent nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , induced by a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on dose , patients should be monitored with am@@ nesty or@@ yl@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , caution is advis@@ able at the simultaneous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with drugs , which pro@@ long the QT @-@ interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or that tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , al@@ an@@ xi is to be used in connection with chemotherapy or vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in@@ hibited the activity of five studied chemical therapeu@@ tics ( Cis@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , d@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there were no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and an Ste@@ ady @-@ static concentration of oral Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ides , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis it was shown that the simultaneous use of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , C@@ elec@@ on@@ oids , chlor@@ hex@@ ag@@ ine , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ser@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ser@@ tr@@ in and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience to use Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies don &apos;t lie before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used during pregnancy , unless it is deemed necessary to treat the treated doctor .
clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observe observed side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) that were at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in the context , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and or@@ char@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reaction and reactions on delivery ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints , and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar rentals were found in adverse events as in the other dos@@ ages ; there were no dose policies to observe .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were performed due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy at a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies were enrolled in a total of 1,@@ 132 patients with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of c@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. of on@@ dan@@ ac@@ ron ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) , which was given on Day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azine and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were obtained with patients that were given to 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given on Day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the I@@ on@@ enk@@ an@@ äle into the vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ activ@@ ist and pro@@ long the duration of the shareholder potenti@@ als .
the target of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ v. administered pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
absorption After intraven@@ ous gift followed an initial elim@@ ination of the plasma concentration of a slow elim@@ ination from the body with an average terminal @-@ time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the whole dose area of 0,@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in the total dose and cancer patients dos@@ ed propor@@ tionally .
according to intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean age was measured between day 1 and day 5 ( ± SD ) increase in the palm @-@ on@@ site plasma concentration of 42 ± 34 % .
in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations , the total figure was measured by 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with following one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with which after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration was measured at 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ max was 0.@@ 75 mg higher compared to one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration .
about 40 % will be eliminated about the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
in @-@ vitro studies have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lower degree , the I@@ so@@ tic CY@@ P3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approx . 80 % of the dose within 144 hours of urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered substance made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a single @-@ time intraven@@ ous li@@ bit@@ al injection , the whole @-@ body weight was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function mal@@ function increase the termin@@ ale elim@@ ination @-@ time and the average system@@ ic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified .
clinical studies were observed only after ex@@ positions which are regarded as sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a small relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 . clinical studies realis@@ es that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of in@@ tim@@ acy channels that are involved in vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ activ@@ ist and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation , and pro@@ long the action potential .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in about the 30 times of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which resulted in an increased frequency of liver tumor , end@@ oc@@ r@@ ines ne@@ op@@ las@@ m ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , however not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but because of the used high dos@@ ages and da Alo@@ xi at human being used for unique use , relev@@ ance of these results will be minimal .

in a micro@@ scop@@ ic investigation the liver tissue damage occurs as well as the values of the liver enzyme Al@@ an@@ in Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood standard .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on presented data to pro@@ hibit the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( efficacy structure , composition and purity of the medicine , effect , safety and efficacy of hepat@@ itis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepat@@ itis C , the efficacy of alp@@ he@@ on with the efficacy of reference ten@@ ure was compared to 4@@ 55 patients .
in the study it was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment to the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .

furthermore , concerns were largely imp@@ acted that the data on the stability of the active substance and the drug are not sufficient .
the number of patients suffering from hepat@@ itis C , which spoke to treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after adjusting the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on infl@@ amed the disease to more patients than with reference agents ; Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects .
apart from this , the test was used in the study to study the question , as far as the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms anti@@ bodies - specific proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficiently reconc@@ iled .
it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go ( one with cr@@ ust , her@@ ed@@ itary skin infection ) and small infected la@@ z@@ ations ( bite or lac@@ un@@ ks ) , s@@ me@@ ar and se@@ wn w@@ ounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go shall not be used for the treatment of infections that have been proven to be caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not work against this kind of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but with patients under 18 years of age , the skin surface must not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment for two to three days , the physician should consult the patient once again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial giant ( the parts of the bacterial cell , which proteins are produced ) and reduces the growth of bacteria .
main indi@@ an of efficacy was in all five studies of the patients whose infection was compl@@ ained after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under alt@@ ar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2,1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo spoke to treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin cells , alt@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were combined with skin dogs , about 90 % of the patients were treated to treatment .
in these two studies , however , that alt@@ ar@@ go has been found in the treatment of ab@@ ut@@ ches ( hollow @-@ filled cav@@ ities in body tissue ) or of infections that were shown to be proven by MR@@ SA , not effective enough .
the most common side effect with alt@@ ar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the Con@@ servatory .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go , with infected small in@@ firm@@ ities , sc@@ rap@@ ed@@ dings or wires .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for marketing from Al@@ tar@@ go to the European Union .
the patients , which shows no improvement within two to three days , are to be examined once again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of sensiti@@ zation or serious local irrit@@ ation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ine the treatment is can@@ cel@@ ed , the oint@@ ment has been carefully removed and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection has begun .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used for treatment of infections in which MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogen or assumed ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies on secondary infected w@@ ounds , the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was caused by patients with infections that were caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no wor@@ r@@ ying or deteri@@ oration of the infected person occurs .
the impact of simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical methods of the same skin area is not studied and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma centr@@ ation , which have been achieved for people after top@@ ical use on rough skin or infected @-@ surface w@@ ounds , a clin@@ ically @-@ relevant imp@@ air@@ ment in vi@@ vo is not expected to be expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 According to the con@@ current gift of 2 times a day 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was increased by 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin next to the top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ve on the di@@ ced skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure after top@@ ical application in patients , dose adjustments are not required for patients when top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin are applied during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproduction of recur@@ rence after oral in@@ gest@@ ion and are in@@ adequate for a statement on the birth and the federal / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is indicated clearly and the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of an system@@ ic antibiot@@ ic .
in deci@@ ding if the breast@@ feeding continues / ended or the therapy with alt@@ ar@@ go continues / ended , between the benefits of a nur@@ sing for the inf@@ ant and the benefits of alt@@ ar@@ go therapy for woman should be with@@ drawn .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , which Al@@ tar@@ go had been applied , was the most common effect on the adoption of approximately 1 % of the patients .
mode of mode ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of tur@@ mo@@ rom@@ per , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ cu@@ v@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ cu@@ anus ) .
the effect mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a certain bond of the bacterial path@@ o@@ oms which differs from the engagement of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ pret@@ ating anti@@ bacterial substances .
data suggest that the binding agency ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P li@@ aison office and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ board centre .
by binding at this engagement of P@@ leu@@ kins , the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transferred , block partly P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent normal formation of active 50s as secondary sub@@ units .
should due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of the resistance to the resistance of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some cases of infection seem to be considered by experts .
there were no differences in the In @-@ vitro Activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin against S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the ins@@ ulator were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of a non @-@ response to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us treatment the presence of tribes with additional virus factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine , Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study of healthy adults was applied 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ine daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion and placed on shar@@ pen@@ ed skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ine twice daily for 5 days to the top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected w@@ ounds , single plasma samples were gained .
sampling tests were carried out on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before medi@@ ation and children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic recording of man after top@@ ical application of 1 % sal@@ ine on 200 c@@ m2 has been shot down on 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g / h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin for the PGP in@@ hibition .

ambient rix is used for protection against hepat@@ itis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children between the ages of 1 and 15 who are not immune to these two ill@@ nesses .
Ambi@@ rix is applied as part of a vaccine existing from two doses , whereby the protection against hepat@@ itis B may be reached only after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix should only be used when Immun@@ ization is caused by a low risk of hepat@@ itis B infection and ensures that the vacc@@ ination may be brought to an end from two doses .
if a r@@ ying dose against hepat@@ itis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or other hepat@@ itis B or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines act as contributed to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defense ) , as it can fight against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and produces anti@@ bodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ambience rix contains the same components as the vaccine Twin@@ rix A@@ du@@ t since 1996 and the vaccine licensed vaccine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are applied to protect the same disease , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are given as part of an existing vacc@@ ination to be administered .
because ambient rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults are also used as proof for the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective anti@@ con@@ centric month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children the efficacy of the vaccine is compared with six months and a 12 month interval between the two injec@@ tions .
Ambi@@ rix carried out a month after the last injection to the development of protective anti@@ de@@ concentration against hepat@@ itis A and B between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children .
the additional study showed that the degree of the Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month interval between injec@@ tions .
the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ aches , appet@@ ite , pain at the injection point , red@@ ness , mat@@ ur@@ ation ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be applied to patients who may react hyper@@ sensitive to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
August 2002 , the European Commission granted the Company G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals . an approval for the Ambi@@ rix meeting in the entire company
the standardi@@ zation plan for the edge dim@@ mer with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administered at the appointment of the choice and the second dose is administered after the first dose .
if a so@@ lic@@ itation is desired both for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B , the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated or combined with a combination @-@ sim@@ p .
the anti @-@ hepat@@ itis B surface an@@ tigen , anti @-@ hepat@@ itis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepat@@ itis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ hepat@@ itis C anti @-@ hepat@@ itis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti @-@ hepat@@ itis B anti @-@ hepat@@ itis C anti @-@ hepat@@ itis vacc@@ ines are in the same size as after the vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ers vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet secured whether immun@@ competent individuals who have addressed a vacc@@ ination against vacc@@ ination against vacc@@ ination , as they may also be protected in no longer visible anti@@ bodies by the immun@@ ological memory .
3 As with all injec@@ tion@@ ists , the rare case of an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction , according to the gift of the vaccine , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately .
if a faster protection against hepat@@ itis B is required , the standardi@@ zation sensor is recommended with the combination of combination , which contains 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepat@@ itis B virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepat@@ itis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of ha@@ em@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with the immune system &apos;s immune system , there is no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibody being achieved , so in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines can be required .
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to an optimal imp@@ orter , these injec@@ tions should be avoided .
at Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ t@@ open@@ ia or blood pressure interference , Ambi@@ ent may be inj@@ ected from the exception of sub@@ cut@@ aneous sub@@ cut@@ aneous , as it can occur following in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration to bleeding .
when Ambi@@ rix was given in the second year of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ atic , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - and az@@ el@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined Mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immun@@ otherapy , there may be no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study involving 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , swelling , mat@@ ures , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ ache and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in the former Thi@@ omer@@ ang and preserv@@ ative in@@ oc@@ ative in@@ oc@@ ulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 - including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants in the age of 12 and including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared to the 3 @-@ doses of combination @-@ simulation .
the only exceptions were the higher frequency periods of pain and mat@@ uring on a calculation basis per vaccine dose Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.1 % of subjects following the gift of a dose of 3 doses .
after the complete vacc@@ ination , 6@@ 6.4 % of subjects who had been given at the Ambi@@ rix , over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects that had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination @-@ sim@@ p .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ality was comparable high ( i.e. about the total vacc@@ ination cycle of 3@@ 9.6 % of subjects , the Ambi@@ rix was obtained , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects that received 3 doses of combination @-@ sim@@ p ) .
the frequency of im@@ pregn@@ ated pain and mat@@ ur@@ iness was slight and comparable to that after administration of Combin@@ ation sim@@ ulations was observed with the 3 @-@ cans of vacc@@ ination .
in a compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ inations , the occurrence of local reaction and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ent group was comparable to that which was observed with the 3 @-@ doses of combined hepat@@ itis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepat@@ itis B surface an@@ tigen .
however , for the 6- to 11 @-@ year old , however , at the Ambi@@ ent vacc@@ ination , there was a common cause of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per prog@@ am .
the share of vacc@@ inations , which reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ cans in@@ oc@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepat@@ itis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepat@@ itis B surface an@@ tigen , was statist@@ ically un@@ different .
in clinical trials carried out in vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to and including 15 years , the ser@@ oc@@ on@@ ement rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9,1 % were taken after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ oc@@ acy rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study conducted at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combin@@ ating foam with three doses .
with the 289 people whose imm@@ unity was more valuable , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective rates ( SP in the table below ) was significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dose @-@ im@@ it@@ ant significantly higher than at Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response , which were achieved in a clinical compar@@ ative study of 1- and 11 @-@ year @-@ olds after the completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ cans in@@ oc@@ ulations with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans in@@ oc@@ ulations with a combination @-@ sim@@ ulated hepat@@ itis B virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepat@@ itis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs @-@ anti@@ bodies of at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix was detected in the 0 @-@ 6 months of vacc@@ ination at the time of the immun@@ ization .
the immune response to both anti@@ gens was comparable to both anti@@ gens , which was established in 3 doses with a combination of combination pul@@ p , consisting of 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepat@@ itis B surface an@@ tigen with a dose of hepat@@ itis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs @-@ anti@@ bodies of 24 months after immun@@ isation is comparable to the 0 @-@ 12 month vacc@@ in@@ scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was given in the second year of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ ie@@ - , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - and az@@ ell@@ u@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ umps @-@ vacc@@ inated vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed the current formulation of similar Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective and ser@@ oc@@ on@@ - rates as for earlier formulation .
the vaccine is examined both before and after the resp@@ a@@ wing by eye @-@ slip on any other particles and / or physical visible changes .

the hepat@@ itis @-@ A virus is usually transfer@@ ed from viruses and beverages , but can also be transferred through other paths , such as bathing in water contam@@ inated waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a blow face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may cause a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect the infection with hepat@@ itis C or hepat@@ itis B virus , even if the whole vaccine was complete with 2 doses .
if you / your child is infected with the vacc@@ ination of both vacc@@ ines already infected with Hepatitis C or Hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child may feel un@@ comfortable or feeling ill ) may not prevent a vacc@@ ination attempt to prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that may harm the liver or symptoms that are similar to those of hepat@@ itis C or hepat@@ itis B infection can not be convey@@ ed .
• If you are already an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
an allergic reaction can manifest themselves by it@@ ching skin rash , asthma , or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepat@@ itis A or hepat@@ itis B occurred . • If you / your child has caused severe infection with fever / fever .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepat@@ itis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to usually the second vacc@@ ination daily ) .
any possible risk of infection with hepat@@ itis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination will advise you / your child from an vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend to you / your Child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepat@@ itis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective hepat@@ itis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepat@@ itis B surface anti@@ gens .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is administered usually one month after the first dose and should give you a vaccine protection prior to ending the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix starts with people who are suffering from heavy bleeding problems , under the skin and not in the muscle . if you / your child is weak@@ ened due to a condition or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense , or if you / your child will undergo a hem@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the response of these persons on the vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be needed to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is .
21 S@@ agen your doctor if you / your child may take other medicines / incoming ( including those whom you can get without prescri@@ ption ) or if you / your child recently got vacc@@ inated / has been given to / or is planned for the near future .
however , in this case , the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient , and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepat@@ itis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine needs to be given at Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and possible limbs .
if Ambi@@ rix should be given at the same time or just before or after an injection of Imm@@ ac@@ lob@@ ul@@ ines , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will be enough .
normally , Ambi@@ ent is not given pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating women unless it is urgent that it can be vacc@@ inated with Hepatitis B and Hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you already have an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and make a new appointment as soon as possible .

based on data , which have become known for the issu@@ ance of the first permit for the public transport , CH@@ MP stepped up that the benefit @-@ risk ratio of the Ambi@@ rix remained positive .
as the Ambi@@ rix was brought in only one member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure .

ammon@@ ium is - split by several single doses to meals - swallowed by the food , or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ fier ( through the abdominal wall in the gast@@ ric duct ) or a nose onde ( through the nose into the gast@@ ric duct ) .
it could not be a compar@@ ative study , since ammon@@ ium could not be compared with another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a plac@@ ebo , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
ammon@@ ium may also cause appet@@ ite , stomach ache , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , stomach ache , stomach ache , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , const@@ ip@@ ation , rash , un@@ pleasant body od@@ or , or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that ammon@@ ium in patients with disorders of the urine cycle to high ammon@@ i@@ ac@@ ic values effectively avo@@ ids .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ammon@@ ium was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the condition of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is inde@@ xed to all patients with which a complete enzyme has already manif@@ ested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late en@@ z@@ ym@@ atic form ( complete en@@ z@@ ym@@ atic form , which manif@@ ests itself after the first stage of life ) there is an indication for the use if a hyper@@ text is hyper@@ a@@ or@@ tic en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with can@@ cel@@ ess , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein tolerance and for the growth and the development of daily protein intake of the patient .
according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of more than 20 kg and for growing and adults .
in patients who suffer on a premature lack of car@@ b@@ amide phosph@@ at@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ko@@ scar@@ is bam@@ y@@ las@@ e suffer the subst@@ itution of cit@@ rul@@ ine or arg@@ in@@ ine in a dos@@ ing of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day required .
patients with an Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ ric zinc defic@@ iency need arg@@ in@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 to 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with hat@@ ch faul@@ ts as there is a risk of causing Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets are not immediately going into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 grams ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
in patients with con@@ gest@@ i@@ ver cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency or serious ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency , as well as with sodium re@@ tention and e@@ de@@ formation , must be used only with caution .
because Met@@ abol@@ isation and discharge of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al is carried out via the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results concerning pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat of young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal refin@@ ing and to a increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and reduced number of working neur@@ ons in the brain and thus a disability of brain cancer .
it could not be noted whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat are divor@@ ced in human milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated throughout the lac@@ tation ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients at least had a undes@@ irable event ( AU ) and 78 % of these adverse events was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a likely toxic response to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tical female patient who developed severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , periph@@ eral new rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dos@@ ing occurred at a 5 @-@ month old to@@ d@@ dler at a single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms vary with accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat , which showed dos@@ ed dos@@ ing of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day with dos@@ ed limit@@ ing neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat is a li@@ met@@ abo@@ lically active connection , which is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
ker@@ os@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds containing 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore used as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 Pati@@ ents with disorders of the urine cycle can be assumed that for every gram the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the progn@@ osis of the early manifest@@ o of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ f@@ ists , and the disease itself led to death with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their nit@@ ric free anal@@ a in the first year of life .
by ha@@ em@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat ) it was possible to increase the survival rate new@@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( however , within the first mon@@ month ) companion diagnostic diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and that had already been treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ic end@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with many intellectual disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ko@@ scar@@ c@@ ra @-@ defic@@ iency ) , which were recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ium En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a prot@@ ein@@ ated diet were treated , the survival rate amounted to 98 % .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are also hardly reversible and in some cases further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney , with glut@@ amine which is produced with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were obtained after the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , of hem@@ ost@@ asis and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites was also investigated in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous ha@@ y@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat .
after an oral individual dose of 5 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ ur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al were noted .
in the majority of patients suffering from urea @-@ cycle defect or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ opathy was , according to different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , the next morning no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat in the plasma is demon@@ stra@@ ble .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three individual doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level was five times higher than the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ g@@ ated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine by the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate had no cl@@ ast@@ ogenic effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children that have not swal@@ low ) any tablets or patients with si@@ p faul@@ ts or a gar@@ nish .
according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of more than 20 kg and for growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um prot@@ eine in plasma should be held within the normal range .
in patients who suffer on a premature lack of car@@ b@@ amide phosph@@ at@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ko@@ scar@@ is bam@@ y@@ las@@ e suffer the subst@@ itution of cit@@ rul@@ ine or arg@@ in@@ ine in a dos@@ ing of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day required .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 grams ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if ra@@ ins were exposed before the birth phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat ( active met@@ abo@@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) , there came to les@@ ions in the pyram@@ idal cells of the cor@@ tex .
a likely toxic response to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tical female patient who developed severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , periph@@ eral new rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
ker@@ os@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds containing 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore used as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess .
based on exam@@ inations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the urine cycle can be assumed that for every gram the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are also hardly reversible , and in some cases further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition may occur .
after an oral individual dose of 5 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ ur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al were noted .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not more than 25 ° C .
this approach includes the small measuring spoon 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the big measuring spoon 8.6 g So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient must maintain this medicine by a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dissolved before use even in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so they can accum@@ ulate nitrogen in the body after eating proteins .
when conducted in you laboratory tests , you must inform the physician that you are using AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can affect certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or recently , if it is not prescri@@ ption medicine .
during breast@@ feeding , you should not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine may go over to breast milk and harm your baby .
confusion , head@@ ache , in@@ it@@ ory , memory problems and deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions were also observed in rare cases .
if you encounter any of these symptoms to determine , you immediately get in touch with your doctor or with the reception of your hospital for introduction of appropriate treatment .
if you forget the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in blood cells ( red blood cells , white blood cells , plat@@ el@@ iness , head@@ ache , impot@@ ence , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , const@@ ip@@ ation , rash , kidney function , weight gain and an@@ om@@ al laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the side effects you can significantly imp@@ ly or notice any side effects that are not stated in the user information .
you may no longer use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the use of the box and the container .
like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , the content of the AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whit@@ ish color and oval shape and they are provided with the &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 &quot; embos@@ sing .
30 If there are laboratory studies in you , you must inform the physician that you are using AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can affect certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or recently , if it is not prescri@@ ption medicine .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS into equal single doses or via a gast@@ ric f@@ ist@@ ula ( hose , which runs through the abdominal wall ) or a nose onde ( hose , which is caused by the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take a measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate . • St@@ range from a straight edge , e.g. a knife above the edge of the brass spoon to remove surplus gran@@ ules . • Remove the recommended amount of measuring spoon Gran@@ ules from the container .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in chest pain with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ do &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measured value at electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to the heart of patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients enrolled in the basic study of the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox is associated with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with the traditional combination treatment with hepat@@ oc@@ ytes ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
while PCI was often found a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a lock ) and they received additional medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and A@@ spir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days and one year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who under@@ went a PCI was angi@@ ox in relation to all indicators as effective as Hep@@ arin , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin .
An@@ gi@@ ox must not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to the brain against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other Hir@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other components .
moreover , it may not be applied to patients who recently had a blood flow , as well as with heavy blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for Hep@@ arin .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to provide approval for the marketing of angi@@ ox in the whole of the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina / Non@@ - ST @-@ Heb@@ do inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) ) in case of emergency or an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt of 0,1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if one PCI is performed in another result , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery .
according to the PCI can be resumed after clinical requirements the reduced inc@@ ite dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the pressure .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bolt of 0,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
safety and efficacy of a single Bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT once after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second stro@@ us of 0,3 mg / kg / body weight should be done .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ plac@@ ted and diluted drug should be carefully bl@@ ended before application and administered intraven@@ ously to the bol@@ us dosage .
once the ACT score is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restri@@ ction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which should be subjected to a PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine against ACS or not ) , a lower fusion rate of 1,4 m@@ g. / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is below 225 seconds , a second bol@@ us@@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt is to be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which led to the approval of II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , the ACT score was 5 minutes after the gift of the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine @-@ Bol@@ us without a dose adaptation of 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also di@@ aly@@ tic patients is contra@@ indicated in angi@@ ox ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous medicine of un@@ question@@ able hepat@@ oc@@ ytes or 8 hours after the termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of low @-@ molecular hepat@@ oc@@ ytes .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other components or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ ost@@ asis and / or ir@@ reversible cardi@@ ovascular disease . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ tic patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment to monitor symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is given in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even when PCI @-@ patients occur under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine most of the bleeding associated with arter@@ ial points of points can occur in patients who occur in a sub@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) during the treatment of principle everywhere .
in patients who are taken war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , there should be a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) to ensure that the value is reached after finishing the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in again prior to treatment .
starting from the knowledge about the action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ ia ( Hep@@ arin , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or dens@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ) , it can be assumed that these substances are increasing the risk of blood .
in combination with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine aggreg@@ ation or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ stimul@@ ants , clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis are to be controlled regularly in any case .
the experimental studies are in@@ adequate for the impact on the pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were randomly assigned to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine plus GP@@ I / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ question@@ ized Hep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin plus GP@@ I / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine @-@ Group as well as in patients treated with Hep@@ arin , it was more common in women and in patients over 65 years more than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for heavy bleeding like in Table 2 foot@@ notes .
both lightweight and heavy bleeding performed significantly less than in the groups with hepat@@ itis plus GP@@ I / II@@ IA @-@ inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ I / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY serious bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ ost@@ asis of ≥ 4 g / dl with no apparent bleeding eye , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( ≥ 3 g / dl ) with known blood pressure , re@@ operation because of blood circulation , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood @-@ loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which appeared in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , &quot; other &quot; pun@@ cture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gast@@ ro@@ sh@@ one , ear , nose or throat .
the following information about side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in at 6000 patients who under@@ went a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine Group as well as in patients treated with Hep@@ arin , it was more common in women and in patients over 65 years more than in male or younger patients .
both lightweight and heavy bleeding had significantly fewer than bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine in significantly less than in the compar@@ ative group under Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ I / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported in practice after complete application and are classified into table 6 in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dose the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is immediately collap@@ sed and the patient used to monitor blood flow in relation to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , a direct and specific thro@@ mb@@ in , which bin@@ ds to both the cat@@ aly@@ tic hub and an ag@@ ion region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is tied in the liquid phase or to the cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible because thro@@ mb@@ in s@@ out@@ dated the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thereby re@@ generates the function of the active center of thro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine with ser@@ um of patients , in which it had come to he@@ par@@ in@@ induced c@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ t@@ open@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , was unable to in@@ duce th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic aggreg@@ ation reaction .
in healthy subjects and in patients Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine shows a dose @-@ dependent path@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect involving the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R , and TT .
in case of the patients following a PCI , an additional Bol@@ us of 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine should be given and in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h should be increased .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ question@@ ably Hep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin was given in accordance with relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ do inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA In@@ hibit@@ or at the beginning of the angi@@ ography ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) or at the PCI .
in AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients were spread evenly over the three treatment arms within 72 hours .
about 77 % of patients had recur@@ ring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic operating changes or increased cardi@@ ovascular biom@@ ar@@ kers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients under@@ gone angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on four triple and triple end points of a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study with more than 6,000 patients who were subjected to a PCI ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , are shown in table 10 .
clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine were evaluated by patients who were subjected to a sub@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .
it is expected that Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in as Pep@@ ti@@ d is running a cat@@ abol@@ ism in its amino acid @-@ components with subsequent recovery of amino acids in the body @-@ pool .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need to treat the treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected into the abdominal wall , inj@@ ected or inj@@ ected into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm or administered in@@ fusion with a insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to the body of glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or cannot process insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from humanity , and the change means that it acts faster and a shorter mode of activity has more than a short @-@ effective human being .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin for patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body can produce no insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and a study with 5@@ 72 children between four and 17 years .
in case of type 2 diabetes , where the body can &apos;t work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the concentration of gly@@ co@@ iled hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was found compared to a lower@@ ing of 0.14 % for insulin shots .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.9 % of human normal dosage .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be applied in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to insulin or any of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adapted , if it is administered jointly with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ A@@ vent@@ is Deutschland GmbH to provide a permit for marketing A@@ pi@@ dra in the whole of the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is applied as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall , th@@ igh , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the range of abdominal muscles .
due to the reduced glucose load capacity and reduced insulin delivery , the insulin requirement for patients with a limitation of liver function can be reduced .
any change of active strength , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or production method can undergo a change of insulin delivery .
3 An in@@ sufficient dosage or termination of a treatment , particularly in patients with an ins@@ ul@@ able diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and di@@ abe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ de ; these conditions are potentially threat@@ ening .
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or a insulin dose should be carried out under strict medical supervision and can make a change in dosage .
the time of occurrence of hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active insulin profile and can therefore change in changing the treatment schem@@ as .
to the substances which increase the bleeding activity and increase the slope to hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ph@@ ics , include oral anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tics , an@@ ox@@ et@@ ine @-@ converting enzyme ( Mao ) inhibit@@ or , pent@@ ox@@ if@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ al , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ lic and sul@@ fa antibiot@@ ics .
additionally , under the effect of symp@@ a@@ oly@@ tics such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ in , gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and reserves , the symptoms of ren@@ ren@@ al oppos@@ ites may be weak@@ ened or absent .
experimental studies on re@@ productive tox@@ icity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin regarding the pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin shots occur in human breast milk , but in general , insulin is neither into breast milk , nor is it absorbed after oral application .

severe hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ch@@ ests with in@@ tram@@ us@@ el@@ ess@@ ness can be given by in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a correspon@@ d@@ ingly trained person , or treated by a doctor &apos;s intraven@@ ous gift .
after a glu@@ ing injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to identify the Ur@@ al cause of severe hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the periph@@ eral glucose levels ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing the glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous squ@@ ir@@ - take care of insulin shots faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal .
in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , T@@ US showed a dose of proportional , glucose load @-@ ranging from 0,0@@ 75 to 0.15 E / kg , and with 0,3 e / kg or more , a proportional increase in a glu@@ ing effect , exactly like the human being .
insulin @-@ insulin has a double so @-@ fast response entry such as normal human@@ ities and achieves a total of about 2 hours earlier than the human being .
from the data it was obvious that a similar post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic control in 2 minutes before the meal is achieved like with human normal dosage , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if the is@@ lan@@ l@@ ul@@ cer was ge@@ ared in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ al control was given as with human normal dosage , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if the insulin is turned around 15 minutes after the meal , it will be a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control as in human normal dosage , which is given 2 Mi@@ - gro@@ oves prior to the meal ( see figure 1 ) .
at the beginning of the meal , insulin is 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the meal was given before the meal ( figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal surgery , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - previously ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
at the beginning of the meal , insulin is 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - after the beginning of a meal , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - previously ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1C ) .
