<seg id="1">The present document is a summary of the European Public Report (EPAR) which is explained how the Committee created for Medicinal Products (CHMP) in order to obtain recommendations on the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you require further information on your sickness or treatment, please read the package deal (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you want further information regarding the CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for insertion (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. teres thinking and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and madness; • Bipolar-I-disorder, a mental disorder where patients manic episodes (periods of abnormal feeling) alternately have with normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe economic episodes and to preventive medical episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased unrest or behavioral disorders if the oral ingestion of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be applied to intake or melting tablature in patients with hatching of tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who simultaneously connect other medicines that are equally remined as Ablify should be adapted to the dose of Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this affects the signal transmission between brain cells" "" "neurotransmitter" "", "i.e. chemical substances which allow the communication of nerve cells themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Aria razol is probably used mainly as a "partial Agonist," for the receptors of the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that, as a 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, this means lower degree as the neurotransmitter, in order to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin also play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disturbance, it wears to normalize the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and their reoccurrence is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent reoccurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">In two studies, the efficacy of injection solution was compared in two studies of 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, compared to a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify became over twelve weeks at 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo, to prevent reoccurrence, to 160 patients with which the manic symptoms have been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injector was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder which were associated with increased unrest, with the Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medicine) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">All trials used to change the symptoms of patients based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies by investigating how the body absorbs the melting tablets and solution to absorb (decreases).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with injection solution, patients that Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased unrest than the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">When applying the bipolar disorder Abilify was reduced in four of the five short-term clinical symptoms effectively treated as placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented for up to 74 weeks as a placebo the reoccurrence of almond episodes with previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses have also been more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify to intake (observe with 1 to 10 of 100 patients), headache (dilapidation), headache (constipation), vomiting, Nausea (nausea), vomiting, Nausea (nausea), spittle, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia (insomnia) and anxiety (insomnia) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and a new manic episode in patients who mostly lacked manic episodes and in which the manic episodes spoke to the treatment with Aria piping, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disorders in patients with chronic episodes in bipolar-I disorder when oral therapy is not suitable to concealed against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for introducing and Abilify in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who produced mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aria razol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day a day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven although single patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, irrespective of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors may justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from Combination Therapy, the Aria pipe dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicides's behavior belongs to psychotic illnesses and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases following before or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aria pipol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotika.</seg>
<seg id="37">Arinirazol should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases, cardiac insufficiency, cardiac insufficiency, conditions for hypotonia predisponation (dehydration disease, treatment with blood pressure fever toxins) or hypertension (including acoccized and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials that followed one year or less, there were occasional reports of while treatment with arias by Aria razol.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients treated with ABILIFY patients and symptoms of late-dynineesis, should be withdrawn, reduce the dose or reduce the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient developed signs and symptoms, which indicate a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all Antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, have to be deposed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aria pipelol in patients with Krampires should be used in the history of history or with conditions related to crampires, with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old with Aria razrazol to patients associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Arinirazol were treated, an increased risk of death in comparison to the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted cerebrovascular events in treated with Aria pipelol treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with Ketoazide or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychic drugs, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no precise risk assessment for hyperglycemia related events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychic drugs treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, Polyurie, Polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly be observed in terms of worsening the glucose values.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar regimens, the use of antipsychotic membrane, with weight gain as a side effect and may lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Owing to the primary effects of Aria razol to the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aria piping is taken in combination with alcohol or other central medicines such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famagidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption of the Aria razol, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study of healthy subjects a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased its AUC by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other high-effective Inhibitors of CYP2D6, like fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore, similar dose-reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "with CYP2D6" bad "" "" (= "" "" Poor "" ""), the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentration of Aria pipelol in comparison to the CYP2D6 extensive metabolism. "" "</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should weigh potential risks for patients.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteases, might have similar effects and therefore should have similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After finishing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of ABILIFY should be raised to the dose height before beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered jointly with ABILIFY, can be used with an even increase in the Arial concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">Clinical trials showed a significant effect on the metabolism of CYP2D6 (dextrometorphan / 3-methodology of morphine morphine), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Ometiczole) and 3A4 (dextrometorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Aria razol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the inadequate data protection for the human being and because of the concerns caused by the animal protection, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit is justifies the potential risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as in other antipsychotics, patients ought to be warned not to use hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are safe that Arimerrazol has no negative impact.</seg>
<seg id="61">In more common adverse events (≥ 1 / 100) the following side effects were classified as medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The incidence of side effects specified below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks occurred in patients with a total of less incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonie and Dyninesia, compared with patients who were treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19% was treated in patients under Aria pipol treatment and 13.1% in patients under Placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated in patients treated with Aria piping, 15.1% in patients under Olanet therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Theoretical episodes with bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% was in patients under Aria pipel- treatment and 53,3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% was treated in patients under Aria pipol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">During a period of 26 weeks during a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% was treated for patients under Aria pipel- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aria razol and placebo where potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters, yielded no medical significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements of CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aria pipelol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects that could occur in connection with anti-psychotic therapy, the malignant neuroleptine syndrome, late dyatinesia and crampires, relying cerebrovascular events and increased mortality with older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">Clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate overdosiders were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg, and without death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">"" "although no information about the effectiveness of a haemulation occurs in the treatment of overdosing with Aria pipelol, it is unlikely that Hemangialysis is in the treatment of an overdose of benefits, as a high plasma micropipe connection." ""</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the effectiveness of Arinirazol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder via the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine di2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Ariilrazol in vitro showed high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor as well as an excessive affinity to the dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrengen and to histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of arithmerazol in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy subjects the Positcartridges-Tomography showed a dose-dependent decrease of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor-ligine, at the nucleus caudatus and at the turkey.</seg>

<seg id="78">In a haloperidol study was 52% of the response patients who contributed to the study medication, in both groups (Aria razol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales, which were defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression dial, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled trial of 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia a significantly higher reduction in response rate that was found in 34% in the Aria razol group and at 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanet multi-blind study with schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was observed significantly less patients with a weight gain of at least 7% (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg at an average weight of ca. 5.6 kg).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with a flexible or mixed episode of the bipolar-I-disturbance, Ariilrazol showed a versus placebo superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I-disturbance, Ariilrazol showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, Ariilrazol showed a compared to placebo covered efficiency in Week 3 and a maintenance effect, which was comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in Week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, Aria razol also showed a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania on like lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial of 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without mental stress, which partially appeared over 2 weeks, the companion therapy with Aria pipelol showed superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 in a placebo-controlled trial of 26 weeks followed by a long-term expandable phase over 74 weeks before Randomisation had achieved a remission in relation to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bipolar return, mainly in prevention of a back in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzyme CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxylasol. the N-dealkylating enzyme is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aria razrazol for a comprehensive metabolic rollers of CYP2D6 and close to 146 hours at 'bad' (= 'Poor') with CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aria pipol, there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female volunteers, and in schizophrenic investigation, schizophrenic patients showed no sex dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A simulation-specific evaluation for pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences in regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking locating the pharmacokinetics in the pharmacokineol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Ariilrazol and Dehydro-Aria razrazol were similar in patients with severe kidney disease. compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study of subjects with different grievous liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of the liver function of Aria razol and Dehydro-Aria razol, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of class C, which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on the safety harmacology, toxicity at repeated treatment, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and to the channel-balanced potential the pre-clinical data were no particular dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in doses or expressions that clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, thus they have limited or no importance for the clinical application.</seg>

<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total-paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analog to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous gift of Abraxane an patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration on multiphasic way decreased.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume amounted to 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume has an extensive precise distribution and / or soft distribution of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced positive tumors, the pharmacokinetic properties of Paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane compared to a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent-related Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearing of paclitaxel was higher according to the Abraxane-gift (43%) than after a solvent-containing paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was Abraxane higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue coating is reported that Paclitaxel is primarily metabolized - to 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller Metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-dihyoffaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean recommended dose was 4% of the total dose with less than 1% of the total dose of 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-far-renal Clearance.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed showed an organic medicine, which is already approved in the European Union (EU) and it contains the same substance (also called "reference agents").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood pressure values, in which to occur with blood transfusion complications, in case of the procedure, a blood circulation is not possible and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician, the experience in the treatment of patients with diseases, which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self-bleeding, Abseamed must be injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">Injection can be carried out also by the patient or his counsellor, if they have received an appropriate guide.</seg>
<seg id="364">Patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy are given always in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per decimal) in adults or between 9,5 and 11 g / dl of infants.</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are to be used before treatment, to ensure that no iron deficiency is, and iron complementary should be given during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who received chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems, anemia can cause an anythropoietine deficiency, or that the body is not sufficient for the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietine is also applied to surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which enables it to become the formation of epoxy.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared to an injection in a Vene in a trunk of 479 patients who were caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study were injected at least eight weeks before Eprex / Erypo was injected into a Vene before they were either deported to Abseamed or continue to received Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for efficacy was the alteration of the hemogloat values between the beginning of the study and the reference period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also put the results of a study in which the effects of Eprex / Erypo was researched with 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients who suffered from kidney problems caused by kidney problems, the hemogloids were killed in the same measure as with those patients who continue to get Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In contrast, patients who continue to get Eprex / Erypo received an increase of 0.063 g / dl of an initial value of 12,0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure that occasionally leads to symptom of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, continuous, continuous headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed must not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against epoxy or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems, as further studies are needed to ensure that there are no allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the drug has been approved for a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, which places Abseamed, will provide information on the safety of the medicine, including information on the safety of the medicine.</seg>

<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion needs in adults with solid tumors, malignant lymphoma or multiplem myeloma that consists of chemotherapy and in which the risk of transfusion is made (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia at the beginning of the chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anemoglobin (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / l. [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient (4 or more units blood for women; 5 or more units blood for men).</seg>
<seg id="383">To reduce foreign blood, Abseamed can be used in front of a major elective orthopedic procedure in adults without iron deficiencies in which a high risk of transfusion computations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml can be applied, which cannot participate in an autologous blood donor program.</seg>
<seg id="385">Hemoglobin targets are between 10 and 12 g / dl (6,2 - 7,5 mmol / l), except for paediatric patients with whom the hemogloat concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5,9 - 6.8 m / l) should be lying.</seg>
<seg id="386">Evaluation symptoms and symptoms can vary depending on age, gender and overall disease-load; therefore an assessment of individual clinical overflow and disease management is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in hemogglobins by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemogloglobin values can occasionally be observed above or below the hemoglobin.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given these hemoglobin variability a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemogloare exceeds by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month, or if the permanent hemogloam exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epic-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored in order to ensure that epoxy in the lowest approved dose, which is required for control of anaemia and angible symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">These clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb-value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) might need more coverage than patients with which initial anemia is less heavy (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl) or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">These clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb-value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) might need higher degree of maintenance (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week via an intravenous application, if necessary with a dose of 25 I.U. / kg (three times per week), until the desired target is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms and symptoms can vary, depending on age, gender and overall disease-load; therefore the assessment of individual clinical overflow and disease management is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given these hemoglobin variability a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored in order to ensure that Epoetin alfa is in the lowest approved dose, which is necessary for control of the flu symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 treatment weeks of hemogloare increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the retikulozytensnumber by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, should be maintained three times per week or 450 I.U. / kg per week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin rise &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the retikulozytends increased &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared with the initial value, the dose should be raised to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after further 4 treatment weeks with 300 I.U. / kg three times per week of hemoglobin to ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the retikulozytenscount increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, should maintain the dose of 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">By contrast, the hemogloon value of &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the retikulozytency has increased by &lt; 0,62 mmol / l) respectively, an response to the epic-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be interrupted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%), in which the preventive storage of ≥ 4 blood conservations should be needed, should be assigned to a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="403">Using the iron substitution, as early as possible - a few weeks before the start of the autologous blood-endeavor programme - a few weeks before the start of the expulsion, large iron reserves are to be available.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoxy, which should be given once weekly for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before the surgery and the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">In this case, epoxy preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg should be given in each 10 consecutive days, on the day of the surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of dialysis over the hose of a fistelnadel, followed by 10 ml of isotonic cooking-saline, to rinse the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medicine in the cycle.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who fell under the treatment of some erythropoetine on a erythroblastopenia (pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not get a faramed or another erythropoetine (see section 4.4 - Erythroblastopenia).</seg>

<seg id="411">Patients with sudden action loss, defined as reduction of hemoglobin values (1-2 g / dl per month), with increased demand of transfusions, should be investigated for non-failure (iron, follicles or vitamin B12 deficiency, infections or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis).</seg>
<seg id="412">If the refractive cyte value, taking into account the anemic cytes (i.e. the retikulocytes), and if no other reason of any ingredient is found, the anti-Erythropoetine antibodies should be determined, and an investigation into the boninal cord for diagnosis of a PRCA should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data for immunogenicity at subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk of antics induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not enough.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In cases with chronic renal insufficiency, the limit of hemoglobin-target concentration should not be exceeded in Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, increased mortality rate and risk for severe cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoese-stimulated active agents (ESA) have been given with a hemoglobin- target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical trials have no significant benefit that is attributable to the gift of epochondes, if the hemogloinkonzentration is attributable to the concentration of flu symptoms and the prevention of blood transfusions required.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobin rise should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary heart failure or congestation insufficiency should not be exceeded under section 4.2, the limit of hemoglobin-target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to present knowledge, the treatment of anaemia with epoxy in adults with renal insufficiency, which is not dialysis, is not accelerated until the insufficiency of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In cancer patients under chemotherapy, a 2-3-week delay should be considered for the assessment of therapy efficiency from epoxy-gift and the erythropoetine answer (patients who need to be transduced).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month, or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8,1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 (see section 4.2) treatment of patients with chemical therapy-related anemia - doses above 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to apply recombinant Erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk reduction in the patient's participation, which should also consider specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are envisaged for a larger elective orthopaedic procedure, if possible, before the beginning of epoxy-therapy the cause of anaemia is examined and treated appropriately.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who prefer a larger elective orthopaedic procedure should have an appropriate thrombosis propheylaxis, as they have an increased risk for thrombotic and vascularial diseases, particularly in case of underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">Additionally, it cannot be excluded that during treatment with epoxy for patients with a starting sample of &gt; 13 g / dl, an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascularious events can persist.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epochonine was not proven that they improve overall survival in tumor patients or reduce the risk of cancer progression.</seg>

<seg id="428">If epochonalfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporridge can be adjusted to rising hematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">From in-vitro studies on tumour arches there are no indications for an interaction between epoxy and G-CSF or GM-CSF for the geophysical differentiation or proliferation.</seg>

<seg id="431">The most common effect during the treatment with epochonalfa is a dose-dependent increase of blood pressure or the worsening of existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">An increased incidence of thrombovasculous events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients under the treatment of erythropoetines.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of the pathythropoetine treatment it may occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thrombotic and vasculosis complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically acquired epoxy is glycoached and contained in relation to the amino acids and the carbohydrates part identical to the endogenous human erythropoetine, which was isolated from the urine of primary patients.</seg>
<seg id="435">It could be demonstrated with the help of cultures of human bone marksum cells that epochonalfa stimulates the erythropoese and not influenced the leukopovese.</seg>

<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Zoledron acid concentration at 30% at the end of infusion, but had no effect on the area under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished Clearance of zed by cytochrome P450-Enzymatic systems is unlikely because Zoledronic is not metabolized in humans, because they are a weak or even no direct and / or irreversible ,-based inhibitor of the 450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Zoledronic acid correlated with the Kreatinine Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinine Clearance, and in the 64 investigated patients was 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function to get down to a creatinine-Clearance up to 35 ml / min. no dose adjustment of the zoledronic acid requires.</seg>

<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-inflated intravenous individual dose came in mice 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">For studies on dogs single doses have been 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC the 6quadruple of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous application was determined by administered doses of 0.6 mg / kg as 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, in a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose that corresponds to the 3-fold of the human-therapeutic exposure, relative to AUC, equals), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated treatment with repeated treatment positions that exceed the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects on other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as on the intravenous injection point.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR to the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Report (EPAR) which has been explained how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has been judged to get recommendations on the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes) in patients (especially overweight patients) in which metformin (a diabetic medication) is not shown. • It can be used together with another diabetic medication.</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin patients (especially overweight patients), metformin can not be satisfactory in the highest tolerable dose alone.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfa harp or insulin, the existing dose of sulfa drugs can be maintained, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of sulfa drugs can be reduced or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin is better exploited and the blood sugar levels fall so that type 2 diabetes can be better set.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Actos was examined in tripley patients; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfa harp, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycaemic hemoglobin, hemoglobin, hemoglobin, hemoglobin, showed how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos has resulted in a lowering of the HbA1c value which makes the blood sugar equal to the doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg were lowered.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Triplex study the effect of an additional gift from Actos to existing treatment with metformin and a sulfa harp showed a decrease of the HbA1c values by 0.94% while the additional gift conducted by Placebo to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin had been studied with 289 patients, the Actos in addition to insulin had a decrease of the HbA1c values from 0.69% to 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients who took additionally placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events associated with Actos were seclusions, infections of the upper respiratory tract (colds), weight gain and hypothesia (reduced sensitivity to irritation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be applied in patients who may react hypersensitive to pioglitazone or one of the other ingredients, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoazide (high blood pressure level - purification - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos was supposed to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients with which metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000, the European Commission granted the Office of Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited to promote Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin for type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate, and with them metformin due to contraindications or incompatibility (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the application of Pioglitazon in patients under the age of 18, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who risk a risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attacks or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the physician should begin treatment with the lowest available dose and increases the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain or eclipse, especially those with reduced cardialer reserves.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain and observer if Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular Outcome study with type 2 diabetes mellitus with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and of existing advanced mrovascular disease has been performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in excess of heart failure, which, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output of liver disease (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the norm) or with other signs of liver illness, Pioglitazon may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror increases to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver values are again to be controlled again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient has developed symptoms that point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, loessness, fatigue, appetite and / or darker pens, the liver values are to be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether treatment of the patients with Pioglitazon continues to be led by the laboratory parameters by the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitazon a dose-dependent weight gain was detected, which can stir from fat deposits and in some cases with a liquid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hematology, a minor reduction in the medium hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes have been observed in comparative controlled trials with Pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin to 3-4%) and to a lower degree in patients under Sulfonylharnent and insulin (relative reduction of hemogglobins by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin-sensitive patients, the Pioglitazon consists of oral or triple-combination therapy with a sulfonylharnent or as a dual-combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dosisdependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch was reported under the treatment of thiazolidindions, including Pioglitazon, including a occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic macular deification with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear if there is a direct connection between taking Pioglitazon and the occurrence of maculaödems, but contracting doctors should be aware of a macular procedure; an appropriate ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary of the analysis of indexed events of randomised, randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8.100 patients who were treated with Pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 trams per 100 patients with the Pioglitazon treated with Pioglitazon patients and 1.1 fractures per 100 patients years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patients years) of patients with Pioglitazon were treated with patients with 23 / 905 (0.5 fractures per 100 patients) with patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of a pregnancy or if a patient desires a pregnancy or this entry, is to suspend the treatment (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on investigation of exchange effects have shown that Pioglitazon does not have relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs, which are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, Cyclosporine, Calciumkanalblocker and HMGCoA-reducers are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazon by 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction in the AUC from Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is attributable to the treatment with Pioglitazon that reduces hyperinsuline and increased insulin-resistant insulin resistance, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for the fossil growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very commonly &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (from these data not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="791">This lead to a temporary change in the tumor and the refractive index of the lens, as they can also be observed in other hypoglyctic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, ALT-Angles stepped up on three times the upper limit of the norm range as often as placebo, but less often than in comparative groups under metformin or sulfa harp.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with existing advanced mrovascular disease was the frequency of heavy heart failure under Pioglitazon by 1.6% higher than under placebo when Pioglitazon resp.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch has been reported in case of cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazon, but more often if Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure.</seg>
<seg id="795">It was conducted in summary of the analysis of indexed events of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazon treated groups and over 7,400 patients in patients treated with comparable medical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study period of 3.5 years, fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%) of the patients treated with Pioglitazon, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in people who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day after seven days no symptoms appear.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to work on a activation of specific core receptors (Peroxic Proliferator or Receptor-γ (PPAR-g)) which results in animal model to increased insulin-sensitive liver, fat and skeleton muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose analysis in the event of insulin-resistant.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid versus Gliclazid as a monotherapy has been carried out over two years to investigate the time of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy a blood sugar (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by Pioglitazon at 69% of the treated patients (compared with 50% of the patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar were randomised with insufficient optimisation phase with insulin, to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45%, compared with the patients who continue to receive only insulin. a reduction of insulin-saliation in the group treated with Pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over one year, a statistically significant decrease in the Albumin / Kreatinine quotas compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested on type 2 diabetics in a small, spread over 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, a reduction of the entire plasma triglyceride and the free fatty acids and an increase in the HDL- cholesterol levels and an increase in the HDL- cholesterol levels were observed in the comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone was reduced in comparison to placebo, metformin or genliclazid, the entire plasmatriglyceride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo a statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed, while under Metformin and Gliclazid decreased values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon do not only reduced the sober triglyceride level, but also improved triglyceride levels, this also has an effect on triglyceride absorption, as well as a triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced mrovascular disease were randomized in groups of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular treatment either in either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazon is absorbed quickly, with the top concentration on unaltered Pioglitazon in the plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution from M-IV to the effectiveness in approximately the triples of the efficacy of Pioglitazone whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazon could not affect the relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) reduces or reduces the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive polymoglitazon in humans the marker was found mainly in the cases (55%) and to lower degree in the harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-elimination period of unaltered pioglitazon is 5-6 hours when humans are 5-6 hours and the total active Metabolites is at 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentration of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are similar in patients with reduced renal function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral Clearance of the parent form are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, mice, rats, dogs and monkeys coincide with repeated treatment with hemodilution, anemia and reversible excentric heart hypertrophies.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is attributable to the treatment with Pioglitazon which reduces hyperinsuline and increased insulin-resistant insulin, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for the flowup growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male-rats) of the uretic epithelium were induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the family-omatous polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other thiazolidindions resulted in increased frequency of collures.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patients years) of patients with Pioglitazon were treated with patients with 23 / 905 (0.5 fractures per 100 patients) with patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study of two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin each with Pioglitazon or Gliclazid were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">Clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease in the Albumin / Kreatinine quotas compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon do not only reduced the sober triglyceride level, but also improved triglyceride levels, this has an effect on the tryglyceride absorption, as well as on the hepatic trygeride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked its primary endpoints, a combination of the total mortality, non-deadly myocarbowel syndrome, leg amputation above the Knuckles, coronary reascularization and reascularisation of the leg arteries suggest that with the intake of Pioglitazon does not involve cardiovascular risks.</seg>

<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror which indicates that the blood sugar levels were lowered considerably as with another human being.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive to human (cDNA) or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, doses of Actraphane may be customized if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (the full list can be found in the package directions).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of acetylane are outweighed in the treatment of diabetes against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted the Company Novo Nordisk A / S for introducing actraphane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Premixed insulin products normally be applied once or twice daily if a fast-initial effect is desired with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients with their blood glucose levels increase substantially, for example, through a intensified insulin therapy, hypoglycemia warning symptoms can be kept and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any changes regarding strength, brand (manufacturers), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long-acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin delivery) and / or production method (through recombinant DNA from insulin origin) can lead to a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If changes to Actraphane is required in the patient during the change, it may be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycemia were reported after a change of animal on human insulin, reported that the early warning signs of hypoglycemia were less pronounced than in their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before traveling, which are over several time zones, the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his doctor, as such tours may result in taking insulin and meals at other times, or should be taken.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor therefore needs to consider possible interaction in therapy and its patients are always questioned after others.</seg>
<seg id="879">4. both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycemia, which can occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabeestherapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero.</seg>

<seg id="886">Hypoglycaemia can, however, develop gradually: • Easy hypoglychics can be treated by oral feeding of glucose and glucose or sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape varieties, sweets, biscuits or sugar fruit juice with intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven aid person or given by glucose, which is administered intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect begins within half an hour, the maximum concentration is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile is based on the fact that it is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of splits (hydrolysis) places on the human molecule molecules were withdrawn in consideration; none of the metaboites formed by the unfolding is active.</seg>

<seg id="1329">Excretion After an intravenous gift of a single dose of 14C-Alendronate, approximately 50% of the radioactive substance were eliminated within 72 hours by urine, and little or no radioactivity was found in the cases.</seg>
<seg id="1330">According to intravenous administration of a single dose of 10 mg the renal Clearance of Alendronate was 71 ml / min and the systemic Clearance is not over 200 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="1331">Alendronate is excreted in rats not over the acid or based transport system of the kidneys, and therefore it is not assumed that by humans the differentiation of other medicines is influenced by these transport systems.</seg>

<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform common inspections of the Tacrolimus levels throughout the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-levels of Tacrolimus should also be controlled even after switching from Prograf to Advagraf, Dosisadaptation, modifications of immunosusive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could be controlled (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advaginal sex is a drug with low motance, adaptations of the dose may require several days until steady state has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials should include that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the levels in the blood could not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the valley level of Tacrolimus can be used in full blood in the first time according to liver transplantation in the area of 5 - 20 ng / ml and near-transplant patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the following maintenance therapy of liver, kidney, kidney transplantation, blood concentrations in the area of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to severe adverse events including transplantation or other side effects that may occur in succession of Tacrolimus sub- or exposure.</seg>

<seg id="1444">Patients with diarrhoea is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus- concentrations in the blood that the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subjected to substantial fluctuations under such conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under Prograf performed a chamber or septum hypertrophie, which can therefore also occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disruptions are an already existing cardiac disease, a treatment with cortiosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver function, infections, fluid valuation and oil.</seg>
<seg id="1447">Like other immunosuressiva, the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of malignant skin changes by suitable clothing or using a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1455">Effect of Tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; hence, the simultaneous application of Tacrolimus can be metabolized by CYP3A4, which can impair your metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus can minimize the clearing of steroid-contraceptives and thus increase the hormonal exposure, it is particularly careful in making decisions about anxious prevention.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that Tacrolimus can potentially decrease Clearance of pentobarbital and phenazon and may prolong their half-time.</seg>

<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application form, whether Advate is applied to the treatment of bleeding or the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII-deficiency, which causes blood clots like bleeding within the joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but produced by a method called "recombinant DNA":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell which was introduced to a gene (DNA) which enables them to become the formation of the human right factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is a drug approved in the European Union called rebinate, however, it is produced differently, so that the medicine does not contain protein humaneness or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, among them a study of 53 children under six years, the use of the drug was investigated for the use of blood cells as well as surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the primary study, the efficacy of advances in the prevention of blood vessels in 86% of 510 has been awarded with "excellent" and "well".</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observe at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexie (fever) and the formation of antibodies across factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advance may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive to the human scent factor VIII, mice or hamster protein or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">From March 2004, the European Commission granted the Baxter AG company to provide an approval for the marketing of advances in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage: dosage and duration of substitution is determined according to the severity of the factor VIII-deficiency, after the place and the extent of blood and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>

<seg id="1545">During treatment, it is stimulated to control the dose and the frequency of injections an appropriate determination of the factor VIII-Plasmaspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in response to factor VIII various in vivo recovery and have various semites times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses ranging between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII-Plasmaare cannot be achieved or if bleeding is not ruled with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to prove another inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that the factor VIIItherapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The schedules should be directed according to the patient's reference, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">Formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in treating patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII and IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma of modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">Developing the risk of developing inhibitors, correlated with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII, whereby the risk depends on the first 20 expositions at the largest, and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In previously treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 expositions and anamneically-known inhibitors, after the conversion from a recombinant factor VIII, the product may appear to another, reoccurrence of (low-sighted) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A near women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs's largest number of patients (5 patients) observed in the highest number of patients who were treated previously untreated patients experienced higher risk of formation of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>

<seg id="1644">Advin would have injected directly into the tumours and thus enable the cancer cells to rebuild the normal p53-protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53-protein, which is formed from the non-defect in the human body existing p53 gene, usually carries to restoring damage DNA and to destroy the cells when the DNA can't be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When the p53 gene is defective, the p53-protein does not work properly, and the p53-protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can grow further and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company submitted data from a study involving one patient prior to the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the field of subtree, in the bones and the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">Once the CHMP has checked the questions posed by the company, some questions were still unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the initial documents prepared by the initially submitted documents, the CHMP has a list of questions which will be sent to the company by day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to CHMP opinion, the injection of Advocin was not sufficiently demonstrated in Li-Fraumeni's tumours.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee had further concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration as well as the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not adequately proven that Advocin can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company didn't inform the CHMP if the return has consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advocin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"altered Actual release" means that the tablets are so computed that one of the effective components is absorbed immediately and the other slowly over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal smual swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents 12 years old, the recommended dose of aerinaze twice daily is a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may be relieved with the blockage of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms that were reported by patients before the beginning of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Throughout the study patients carried out their symptoms all 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale as hard the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms, except the blockage of the nose, the patients who reported Aerinaze's income, over a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared with 35.9% compared to patients who pseudoephedrine in revenues alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients showed a relief of 37.4% compared to 26.7% compared to 26.7% compared to the patients receiving desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common adverse events of Aerinaze (observe at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are speediness, dizziness, dizziness, dizziness, dizziness, headache, insomnia (insomnia), somnia (insomnia), somnolence, insomnia, insomnia and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive against abloratadin, pseudoephedrine or one of the other components, against adrenchy agents or loratadin (another drug to treat allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze (hypertension), urinary or vascular diseases (hypertension), hyperthyreosis (hypertension), hyperthyreosis (hypertension), hyperthyreosis (hypertension) or hypertension (hypertension) suffered or have a haemorrhagic stroke (hypertension) or have a risk of haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted SP Europe to provide a permit for placing Aerunaze in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, it is possible to swallow in whole (i.e. without scratching them, breaking down or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be applied in children under the age of 12 because of the lack of data for inconceivable and efficacy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is to be maintained as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms sound.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as with long term application the activity of pseudoephedrine can take off at time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After slowing down the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment can be continued with desloratadin as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As Aerinaze pseudoephedrine contains, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with monogram oxidase (Mao) inhibitor within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine, pergolid, lactamine, ergotamin, ergotamin, ergotamin, phenylephrine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetacolin, naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of these combination therapy was not checked for this patient basis, and the data are not enough to discuss appropriate recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function, and the data are not enough to discuss appropriate recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">The patients need to be informed that treatment in occurrence of hypertension or a speedometer, heart rhythmia, heart rhythmia, nausea or etwaigen, other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a reinforcement of headaches).</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of following patient groups, patients suffering from heart rhythmia • patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension attacks • patients with a myocardial infarction in the history of diabetes, diabetes mellitus, bliophthalsobbin or bronchospasm in the history of history.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is present at least 48 hours prior to carrying out dermatological tests, as antihistamine can reduce positive reactions on indicators of skin reactions or reduce to the extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">As part of clinical exams with desloratadin, with which Erythromycin or ketoconazole, however, no clinically relevant interactions or changes of the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychotic tests there were no significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadin and those treated with placebo-treated patients, regardless of whether Desloratadin alone or with alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme that is responsible for the abolism of Desloratadin was not yet identified, so that interaction with other medicines cannot be excluded entirely.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4, and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibits and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotone.</seg>
<seg id="1683">However, the inconceivable application of aerobaze during pregnancy is not secured, gained experience from a large number of affected pregnancy, and no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and the vasoonstrict properties of Pseudoephedrine should not be applied to aerobaze in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be clarified, however, that it can occur in very rare cases to conduct benommenities, which may lead to impairment of the ability or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS-depression (sedation, apnea, diminished cognitive concentration, cyanosis, coma, heart rate collagen) and a CNS stimulation (sleeplessness, hallucinations, stmor, convulsions) with possible lettuals.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, scarring, muscular tension, muscle weakness, muscle insufficiency, cardiac disease, thirst, perspiration, nausea, vomiting, cervical pain, dizziness, tinnitus, respiration, tdysfunctions and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is especially likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (mouthdry, pupil solidizing, hyperthermia, hyperthermia, and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the hibition of the inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human stem cells / basophilen, as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-selector to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose of adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes including the amplification of subjective beats or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, there were no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo by the recommended dose of 5 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further likomic effects such as an increase in blood pressure, a speedometer or manifestation of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">They participated in the age between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, whereby 414 patients with Aerinaze tablets were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine protagonistic effectiveness of aerobaze tablets, determines from the overall cores for the symptom (except nasal smual swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze's tablets in relation to the swelling effect, determined by means of the nasal smual swelling capacity, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study for pharmacokinetics of aerobaze, Desloratadin is present in the plasma within 30 minutes of administration.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerobaze with healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow-weight of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached in day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the framework of a pharmacokinetic multidosistrial study, which was performed with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects, it was noted that four subjects of Desloratadin were badly damaged.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole gift of pseudoephedrine was equivalent to the gift of an aerobaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity at repeated treatment, to genotoxicity and reproductive meticity, however, the pre-clinical data with Desloratadin have no particular dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination possessed no greater toxicity than its components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproduction, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and to bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day not teratogenic.</seg>

<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup resp.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius has been studied in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (among them four trials in seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies on patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadruple, compromising the sleep and performance of days) before and after a six-week treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies were submitted to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution to intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application of children are harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius represents an average decrease of the Symptom (symptom values) by 25 to 32% compared to the acceptance of 12 to 26% in the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies in Urtikaria the decrease of the symptoms after a six-week treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared with 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive to desloratadin, lauatadin or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">January 2001, the European Commission granted SP Europe to provide a permit for the marketing of aerius in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">A tablet once daily, with or without a meal, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see under Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are restricted experience from clinical trials to effectiveness in the use of Desloratadin for juveniles from 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">Treatment of intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week, or less than 4 weeks) should be terminated according to the previous disease progression and may be resumed after the termination of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In persistent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week, and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to the patient during the entire duration of a prolonged treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with desloratadin tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole have been administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinically-pharmacological study, consuming Aerius and Alcohol does not intensify the effective effect of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be clarified, however, that it can occur in very rare cases to conduct benommenities, which can lead to impairment of the ability or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more side effects were reported in patients with Aerius, than in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events that were more common than in placebo were tiredness (1,2%), mouth dry (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 patients of 12 to 17 years the most common side effect of the headache has been treated with 5.9% of patients who were treated with desloratadin, with 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multiple-dose study involving up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (nineteen clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the hibition of the inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human stem cells / basophilen, as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-selector to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In the framework of a clinical study with multiple doses, administered in the abloratadin a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinically-pharmacological study, in the abloratadin a dose of 45 mg daily (the neunfold of the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, there was no extension of the QTc-interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose- trial with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes including the amplification of subjective beats or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as nizing, nose secretion and itching of nose, itching, trash and redness of eyes and itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in saisonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be divided in dependence on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in an intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">An intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week, or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week, and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown in the overall cores of the questionnaire to the quality of life in Rhino-junctivitis, Aerius effectively diminished the load caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urticaria was investigated as a representative of other forms of urine, because the underlying pathophysiology has been studied despite the surgical pathology in the different forms and chronic patients can be easily recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine-release is a causal factor in all urticaria diseases, in addition, Desloratadin is also confirmed in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in enhancing Pruritus and the decreasing of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose intervalls.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamine with chronic idiopathic urticaria the minority of the patients who did not react to antihistamines, were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of itching over 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with Desloratadin to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with aerius reduced the disturbance of the sleep and of the wax important, as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate this variable.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which the patient Demographs were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients had a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no clues for a clinically relevant links after a daily application of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, this enzyme was not yet identified for the metabolism of Desloratadin, so that interaction with other drugs will not be excluded entirely.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits not CYP3A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 inhibits and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotone.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dossier study with Desloratadin a dose of 7,5 mg, meals (greasy, low-oriented breakfast) was not based on the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical studies carried out with Desloratadin and Loratadin showed a comparable degree of exposure from Desloratadin, no qualitative and quantitative differences in relation to the toxicity fils of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity at repeated treatment, genotoxicity and reproductive meticity, the pre-clinical data with desloratadine have no particular dangers for human beings.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals, to alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see under Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The missing doctor should be aware that most cases of Rhinitis are caused by infection with children under the age of 2 (see section 4.4) and that no data exists, which support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">Besides the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis, physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and skin studies should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of liventized desloratadin limited and experienced a higher subgrade load (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between the ages of 2 and 11 years, which is fully metabolized - is identical to the children that have been normal.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients should not use herbicose intolerance, glucose factose-absorption or a Saccharase isinsufficiency of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinical relevant actions were not identified as part of clinical studies with Aerius tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole have been given in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="1918">The most common adverse events of Ahaase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), Nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Amonase may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive to Ambravir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Ahaase can also not be applied in patients, the currants (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines that are equally remined as vecase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who are taking Ahaase, the risk of a liqueystrophy (alterations in the distribution of body fat), an osteoporosis (severance of bone tissue) or an immunoinactivation syndroms (symptoms of an infection caused by itself).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Ageneric drug in combination with other antiretroviral drugs are used to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the Committee stated that the benefit of vecase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously no protease of protease is not proven.</seg>

<seg id="1926">Ageneric ase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -previously treated adults and children 4 years and older.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually Amonase capsules to pharmacokinetic booths are given at Amburavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amburavir should take place considering the individual viral resistance and pretreatment of patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amburavir as a solution for insertion is 14% lower than the result of Amburavir. therefore, Ageneric ase capsules and a solution are not interchangeable with milligrams per milligram basis (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for vecase capsules is 600 mg Amburavir twice daily along with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If agenerators can be applied without the enhanced addition of Ritonavir (boosted), higher doses should be applied to vecase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for vecase capsules is 20 mg of amcanavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Ambravir, which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of vecase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other proteases were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Ageneric ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the lack of data for inconceivable and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose to Ageneric drugs should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function faults to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous application should be treated in patients with mild or moderate liver function, in patients with severe liver function, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agase may not be given simultaneously with drugs, which have a small therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Isounding ms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations which contain St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may be used due to the risk reduction in plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of Ambravir during the intake of Amburavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be pointed out that Ageneric ase or any other antiretroviral therapy cannot lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with vecase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to other by sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">For usually Agenerase capsules are to be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="1945">Simultaneous use of Ageneric ase and Ritonavir with Fluticone or other glucoocortic acid, which is mistaken for CYP3A4, is not recommended that the possible use of a treatment is overweight and Suppression of the associated gland's function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Because the nutrient change of the HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor is highly dependent on CYP3A4, is not recommended for administration of an asterase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin because of the increased risk of myopia including Rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (among monitoring the International normalised Ratio), are methods to determine active concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take these medicines at the same time, Ahaase can be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of Ambravir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Because of the possibility of metabolic interaction with Amburavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives can be changed, however, the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interaction.</seg>
<seg id="1950">When methadon is given at the same time with Amburavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opiatenttorments, in particular if also low doses should also be given to Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of toxicity of toxicity as a result of the high Propyl English solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain patient groups.</seg>

<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immunotherapy (ART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or remodal opportunistic infection can develop to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial aetiology is taken (including use of cortiosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosuppression), cases of osteoneksis were reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term application of antiretroviral combined therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width of agenerators may not be given simultaneously with drugs, which have a small therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Isounding ms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width of vecase with Ritonavir may not be combined with drugs, whose agents are primarily associated with CYP2D6 which are associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in AUC from Amburavir, which can lead to a leastrological failure and lead to resistence development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">Attempting to compensate a plasma level by a dose of other protease-inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very often unwanted effects on the liver were observed.</seg>

<seg id="1970">Dosing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Ambravir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, it is recommended for a tight surveillance, as the effectiveness and incomprehensiveness of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinic study carried out in combination with didanosin, however, due to the antacid component of didanosin, it is recommended that the revenues of Didanosin and asvase are at least one hour apart. (see Antazida bottom).</seg>
<seg id="1972">This is why the gift of efavirenz is required in combination with Ambravir (600 mg twice daily) and knonavir (100 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with efavirenz in combination with Amburavir and Saquinavir is not recommended since the exposition of both protease inhibitors would drift.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other proteases and existing data suggest that Nevirapin may be sunk in the serum concentration of Ambravir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In case these medicines should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable because Delavirdin may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma level.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these medicines are used together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virology-monitoring has to be performed as a precise forecast on the effects of the combination of Ambravir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of Amburavir and Rifabutin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration of 193%, resulting in an increase in the side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, Rifabutin is administered jointly with Aifabutin to at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data exists.</seg>

<seg id="1982">"" "" "" "the patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions which are linked to these drugs if they are used in combination with vecase." ""</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteases, it is advisable that Antazida can not be taken at the same time as vecase, as it can cause resorption disturbances.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Simultaneous use of anticonvulcanva, which are known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amcanavir can lead to a lower plasma level of Ambravir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentration of calcium blockers such as Amlodipine, diltiazem, thickodipine, niodipine, niodipine, niodipine, niodipine and Verapamil can be increased by 10 through Amburavir, thus reducing the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake of vecase can increase considerably their plasma concentration and intensify PDE5 inhibitors in combination with pDE5 inhibitors, including hypotension, optic nerve and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the knonavir 100 mg capsules daily, with 50 µg flux propionate intranasal (4 times a day), the fluoroonpropionate plasma level increased significantly, while the endogenous Kortisol increased by about 86% (90% confidenzintervall 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of Agenerase with Ritonavir is not recommended that the potential benefit of a treatment is overweight (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">With HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors, such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, the nutrient varies greatly from CYP3A4, are projected to increase the plasma level with concurrent administration.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma performance increases this HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor, including a shabdomyolysis, the combined application of this medicine is not recommended with Amburavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">There is a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as recommended for stabilising the mirror, as the plasma concentration of Cyclosporine, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased at the simultaneous gift of Amburavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Ahaase cannot be applied together with orally filed Midazolam (see Section 4.3) while with the concurrent use of Agenerase with parenteric midazolam caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous use of parenteric midazolam with other lung hibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Midazolam 3 to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadon is given to Amburavir together with Amburavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opiatenttorments, in particular if also low doses should also be given to Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the minimal reliability of historic comparisons, there is currently no recommendation to be given, if Amburavir is administered at the same time with methadon at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With concurrent gift of warfarin or other oral antiglaucoma, an increased control of INR (International normalised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of a decrease or reinforcement of the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods are recommended for contraception.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended for the concurrent gift of vecase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may only be applied during pregnancy only after a careful consideration of the possible use for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lactic rats, Amburavir-related compounds were detected, however, it is not known whether Ambravir is overwhelmed in people in breast milk.</seg>

<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding relevance of certain mutations or mutations can be subject to additional data, and it is recommended to always move the current interpretational systems analysis of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">On phenomenal resistance tests, clinically validated phenotypic interpretational systems can be used in combination with genotypic data for the estimation of the activity of Amburavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease of inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies which expel diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs (divider) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to evaluate results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Amburavir associated genial patterns creates a certain crossresistance to Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and Saquinavir but generally preserved.</seg>

<seg id="2035">The proof of efficacy of vecase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, in which with PI pretreated adults (100 mg twice daily) and a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with lowest knights.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI have been included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis provided the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI Group in the plasma time (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma time (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-underlining nonthreshold of 0,4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the effectiveness of unborn veins is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In studies, Ageneric ase solution to intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg was examined three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, and 2mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low-dosed knonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously obtained at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs combined with Ahaase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cells of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74).</seg>

<seg id="2043">After oral administration the median duration (Tmax) up to the maximum serum concentration of Amburavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">A maximum of 508% increases for Cmax at 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Amburavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amburavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Ambravir 12 hours to dose (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) of food intake remained unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous intake of absorption affects the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as an unhinted penetration of Amburavir from the bloodstream flowing into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the concentration in the plasma, whereby the amount of untreated Ambravir, which is likely to remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of untreated Amburavir remains constant, the percentage of free active ingredients during the dosing intervalls in dependence of the total pharmaceutical concentration in the steady state via the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, drugs have to present or inhibit the CYP3A4 or given a substrate of CYP3A4 if they are given with caution (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Ahaase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily Amburavir exposure, such as adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amburavir is less bioavailable in the solution containing 14% less bioavailable than the capsules; so vecase solution and vecase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligrammbase.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal Clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, therefore the effect of a kidney disease is likely to be minor on the elimination of Ambravir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">This treatment schemata lead to Amburavir plasma screens comparable to that of healthy volunteers according to a dose of 1200 mg Ambravir twice daily without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study mainly the safety of the drug was studied, but it was measured also its effectiveness (by reducing its effect regarding the reduction of Gag concentrations in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years of age, Aldurazyme observed the Gag concentrations in the urine by approximately 60%, and half of the treated children had a normal liver on the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, arthrropathy (joint pain), arthralgic (joint pain), heat feeling, fever and reactions on the fusion station.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measuring size of lung function), speedometer (accelerated heart rate), fever and chandfrost.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may respond to patients who may strongly be hypersensitive to laronidase or any other components (anaphylactic reaction), can not be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will update every year all new information that may be announced, check and update this summary if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will receive patients who are obdurazyme in regard to the reactions to the infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for marketing purposes of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA-technology using Cho-mammal cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, derived from the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indexed to the long-term enzymes in patients with a mudysaccharioutlet I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should take place through a doctor, the experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other heralal metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 e / kg / h can be increased, if the patient is able to increase all 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">Safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosing scheme can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined, and no dosing scheme can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with aldurazyme may develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any side effect, which occur during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, particularly these patients should also continue to be monitored closely, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be available in an appropriate clinical environment in which revitational facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical Phase 3 study, nearly all patients IgG-antibodies against laronidase are usually formed within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when treating Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment following a longer interruption, due to the theoretically increased risk campaign must be careful after a break in treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with drugs (antihistamine and / or antibiotics) to minimize the potential occurrence infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of mild or infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction in the infusion rate to half the infusion rate, in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-conditioned reaction the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are decreased, treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction in the infusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamine and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain because there is a potential risk of interference with intracellular absorption of Laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Experimental studies are not caused by direct or indirect damage to pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns, which were exported to Laronidase via breast milk, is recommended to not satisfy during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The effects of clinical trials were classified as infusion-related reactions which were observed in 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with aldurazyme, which were observed during the phase-3- study and their extension in a total treatment duration of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table: very often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation of the upper respiratory and lungs in the past, severe reactions were carried out on, including bronchospasm, respiratory and facial (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unerdesired drug actions related to Aldurazyme, which have been reported during a phase 2 study involving a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with greater severe expiry and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a weekly (recommended dose), 200 e / kg intravenously at once a weekly, 200 e / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients this occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a Serbian version, whereby the patients aged under 5 years with a heavy digestive form came mostly within one month to a seroconversion (average after 26 days over 45 days in patients at age 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 study (or until a premature retirement from the study), there were no antibody in 13 / 45 patients (RIP) Assay, proversive antibodies, among them 3 patients who had never been too seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a failed to low antium mirror had a robust reduction in the Gag mirror in the Harn while in patients with high antibody titers had a variable decrease of Gag in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralising effect on the enzymatic Laronidase- Activity in vitro, which seemed to affect clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of Gag in the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed not to stand associated with the incidence of undesirable drug reactions, although the occurrence of unwanted drug reactions typically worrying with the formation of IgG anti-antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme is in one for hydrolysis of the cumulative substrates and the reduction of further accumulation of the enzyme.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the cycle and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, the most probable about Manni-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Safety and efficacy of aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study enrolled in 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients were reported from the mean phenotype, and only one patient had the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forcised expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the actual FEV and the absolute contents in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were recruited for an open-label extension study where they received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Aldurazyme treated a improvement in the lung function and the inability that is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study, an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects last up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as follows in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the lower percentage of FEV is clinically significant over this period clinically and the absolute lung volume increased further proportionally to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatoma class before treatment, 22 (85%) had reached a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">In the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of the Gag-mirror in the Harn (µg / mg of Kreatinine) was determined, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In regard to the heterogeneous clinical experience between patients suffering from combined end points, clinically significant changes were summarised in a 6-minute walk, which was observed in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening of 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A single-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which primarily the safety and pharmacokinetics of aldurazyme was examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age (16 patients with severe slip form and 4 with the middle slip form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased because of increased GAG- mirror in the harn in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 e / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were determined according to the Z-Score for this age group (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with a severe mental development speed had a normal mental development speed which only limited to the older patients with severe debital form only limited or no advances in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study investigations of various aldurazyme dosing schemata were carried out on the Gag-mirror in the Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a weekly (recommended dose), 200 e / kg intravenously at once a weekly, 200 e / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing scheme with 200 e / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can be seen in patients who have trouble with weekly infusions, representing an alternative alternative; however, is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemata is equivalent.</seg>

<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on Nadir of absolute Neutrophilenoid, thrombocytes and maximum non-hematological toxicity as they were observed in the preceding treatment cycles - (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 ugly and non-nithological toxicity such as Neutropenie, febrile Neutropenie and infection with Grade 3 / 4 Neutropenie was observed, if a pretreatment had taken place with folic acid and vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2393">All patients treated with Pemetreed must apply folate, folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic approach to the reduction of disease-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="2401">In patients with normal renal function (Kreatinine-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min), high doses of non-steroid antibiotic (NSAIDs, such as Ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid (≥ 1,3 g daily) can lead to a reduced Pemetreed discharge with an increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution must be exercised when patients with normal renal function (Kreatinine-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) can be applied to high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid in a high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in a high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and mindes- to be avoided 2 days after the treatment with Pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there is no data regarding the interaction potential of NSAIDs in a long marine time like Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with Pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral antiagstimulants and antineoplasty chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of INR (International normalised Ratio), when the decision was taken to treat patients with oral antiglaucoma.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Patients that take alli and cannot record weight loss after 12 weeks, should turn to their doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they can avoid some fats in the food, thus making approximately a quarter of the fats decreased to the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study, alli was compared with 391 patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In the two studies of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients that had 60 mg were recorded, after one year noticed an average weight loss of 4.8 kg, compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with alli patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no significant weight loss could be observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common adverse events of alli (observed with more than 1 of 10 patients) are oily stains at after, flatus (winds) with chair-iron, oily / oily chair, finish drinkers (winch), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It must not be applied in patients who are treated with Cicloin (to prevent the effervous exposure of transplantation patients) or with medicines such as Warfarin for preventing blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Furthermore, it may not be applied to patients suffering from a long-term malabsorption syndrome (with which not enough nutrients from the digestive tract) or in cholesterol (liver disease), and for pregnant or lactating mothers.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Alli is indexed to the weight reduction of adults with overweight (body mass index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypothetical, fat-dedicated diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be applied by children and youngsters under 18, since there is no sufficient data for efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">As orlistat is only minimal, however, the elderly and kidney function are not necessary in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any other components • Equal treatment with Ciclosporin (see Section 4.6) • Still time (see section 4.6) • Securing treatment with warfarin or other oral antibodies (see sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a low-rich single meal or fatty food.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since the weight reduction in diabetes may be involved with an improved metabolic control, patients should consult a drug against diabetes before the beginning of a therapy with alli a doctor or pharmacist if necessary to adjust the dosage of antidiabetic.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take alli as well as medicines for hypertension or higher cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage needs to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to prevent additional fluctuating measures in order to prevent the prevention of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">Both in a study on interactions of drugs as well as in several cases with the simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin was observed a reduction of Cicloin plasma plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2522">When using warfarin or other oral antiglaucoma in combination with orlistat, the Quick-values (internationally standardised ratio, INR) could be influenced (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with orlistat, concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as the beta-carotins are in normal operation.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be recommended before bedtime an additional multivitamin should be taken to ensure a sufficient amount of vitamins (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the gift of a starting dose Amiodaron was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers, who received orlistat simultaneously, a minor decrease of Amiodaron plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Experimental studies showed no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are associated with the pharmacological effects of the drug, as the absorption of an assumed fat is avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal effects were determined in clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">Number of times are defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000), very rare (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1000), not known (frequency on the basis of available data not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of known side effects that were determined after the launch of orlistat, is not known because these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">+ It is plausible for treatment with alli to keep silent in regards to possible or actual gastrointestinal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered to normal and overweight patients over a period of 15 days without any significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In majority of cases reported by orlistat overdose cases, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on research on human and animal, a quick reformation of any systemic effect can be attributed to the liveable properties of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect is placed in the lumens of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonds to the active Serin-Rest of the gastric and panniotic lid.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical trials was derived that 60 mg of orlistat taken three times a day, which blocks absorbing of about 25% of the food source.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies on adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 shows the efficacy of 60 mg of orlistat, which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypothetical, fat-proliferated diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial condition (at the time of marginal condition), has been judged as follows: as a result of the body weight in the course of study (table 1) and as percentage of those study participants who lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their weight loss (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Though in both studies the weight reduction was observed more than 12 months, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average alteration in the overall cholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% (initial booking value 5,20 mmol / l) and placebo + 2.8% (output value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (output value 3,30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (output value 3,41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">For the waist circumference, the average change was 4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting with 103,7 cm) and with placebo-3.6 cm (output value 103,5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentration of non metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg of orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, therapeutic dosages could not be metabolized in plasma only sporadic and in extreme low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of an sorulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study involving adipous patients, whom minimally systemic resorated dose could be administered, i.e. M1 (in position 4 hydrolysierter Lacton ring) and M3 (M1 after the folding of the N-Formyl-Leucin group), they identified nearly 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemical therapies which are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (like Cisplatin), as well as in chemical therapy, the excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting are (like cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased through the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a drug which can be used as antiemtics).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application of patients under the age of 18 is not recommended since the effects in this age group do not have enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was examined in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy regimens which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapy, severe triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients who were treated with Aloxi had no vomiting (132 by 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron patients (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapy, excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with Aloxi had no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (153 from 189), compared with 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 from 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">March 2005, the European Commission granted Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd, a permit for the transportation of Aloxi in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer illness.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi to prevent nausea and vomiting, induced by a highly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be enhanced by adding a Corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon dose, patients should be monitored with amnesty orylation or signs of a subacute Ileus after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable at the simultaneous gift of Palonosetron with drugs, which prolong the QT-interval or in patients with which the QT- interval is extended or that tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, alanxi is to be used in connection with chemotherapy or vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron inhibited the activity of five studied chemical therapeutics (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there were no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a unique intravenous dose of Palonosetron and an Steady-static concentration of oral Metoclopramides, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population based pharmacokinetic analysis it was shown that the simultaneous use of CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodaron, Celeconoids, chlorhexagine, paroxetine, paroxetine, seroxetine, sertrin and terbinafin) had no significant impact on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience to use Palonosetron in human pregnancies don't lie before, therefore Palonosetron should not be used during pregnancy, unless it is deemed necessary to treat the treated doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micrograms to observe observed side effects (a total of 633 patients) that were at least possibly with Aloxi in the context, headaches (9%) and orcharation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reaction and reactions on delivery (burning, hardening, complaints, and pain) were reported in post-marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar rentals were found in adverse events as in the other dosages; there were no dose policies to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were performed due to the large distribution volume, however, a dialysis is probably not effective therapy at a Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies were enrolled in a total of 1,132 patients with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of coxorubicin and 250 mcg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mcg. of ondanacron (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg of Dolasetron (half-time 7.3 hours), which was given on Day 1 without dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine and 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were obtained with patients that were given to 32 mg ondansetron, which were given on Day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with highly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters were comparable with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the Ionenkanäle into the ventricular deactivist and prolong the duration of the shareholder potentials.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The target of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the ECG-effects of i.v. administered palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Absorption After intravenous gift followed an initial elimination of the plasma concentration of a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal-time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally in the whole dose area of 0,3- 90 μ g / kg in the total dose and cancer patients dosed proportionally.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean age was measured between day 1 and day 5 (± SD) increase in the palm-onsite plasma concentration of 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">In pharmacokinetic simulations, the total figure was measured by 0.25 mg of Palonosetron on 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) with following one-time intravenous administration (AUC0- ∞) with which after one-time intravenous administration was measured at 0.75 mg. however, the Cmax was 0.75 mg higher compared to one-time intravenous administration.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative opinion in which the approval of the treatment for the treatment of hepatitis C is recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same residence, which is already approved in the EU (" "" "Reference Infirmation" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for adult patients with chronic (long-prolonged) hepatitis C (one liver disease called by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic investigation the liver tissue damage occurs as well as the values of the liver enzyme Alanin Aminotransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood standard.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was brought to the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data to prohibit the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (efficacy structure, composition and purity of the medicine, effect, safety and efficacy of hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of alpheon with the efficacy of reference tenure was compared to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">In the study it was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment to the medicine (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns were largely impacted that the data on the stability of the active substance and the drug are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients suffering from hepatitis C, which spoke to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After adjusting the treatment with Alpheon inflamed the disease to more patients than with reference agents; Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test was used in the study to study the question, as far as the drug forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine), not sufficiently reconciled.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat Impetigo (one with crust, hereditary skin infection) and small infected lazations (bite or lacunks), smear and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo shall not be used for the treatment of infections that have been proven to be caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against this kind of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but with patients under 18 years of age, the skin surface must not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment for two to three days, the physician should consult the patient once again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial giant (the parts of the bacterial cell, which proteins are produced) and reduces the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">Main indian of efficacy was in all five studies of the patients whose infection was complained after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under altargo and 37 (52,1%) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin cells, alttargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were combined with skin dogs, about 90% of the patients were treated to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, that altargo has been found in the treatment of abutches (hollow-filled cavities in body tissue) or of infections that were shown to be proven by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the Conservatory.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, with infected small infirmities, scrapeddings or wires.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for marketing from Altargo to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The patients, which shows no improvement within two to three days, are to be examined once again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of sensitization or serious local irritation by the application of Retapamulin Saline the treatment is canceled, the ointment has been carefully removed and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection has begun.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used for treatment of infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or assumed (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies on secondary infected wounds, the effectiveness of retapamulin was caused by patients with infections that were caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3-day treatment no worrying or deterioration of the infected person occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The impact of simultaneous use of Retapamulin and other topical methods of the same skin area is not studied and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma centration, which have been achieved for people after topical use on rough skin or infected-surface wounds, a clinically-relevant impairment in vivo is not expected to be expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 According to the concurrent gift of 2 times a day 200 mg Ketoconazole the middle retapamulin was increased by 1% Retapamulin next to the topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salve on the diced skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure after topical application in patients, dose adjustments are not required for patients when topical Retapamulin are applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproduction of recurrence after oral ingestion and are inadequate for a statement on the birth and the federal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is indicated clearly and the use of Retapamulin is the gift of an systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding if the breastfeeding continues / ended or the therapy with altargo continues / ended, between the benefits of a nursing for the infant and the benefits of altargo therapy for woman should be withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which Altargo had been applied, was the most common effect on the adoption of approximately 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of mode retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of turmoromper, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passecuvanus (formerly pleurotus passecuanus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The effect mechanism of retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a certain bond of the bacterial pathooms which differs from the engagement of other ribosomal interpretating antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data suggest that the binding agency ribosomales protein L3 is involved and in the region of the ribosomal P liaison office and the Peptidyltransferboard centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding at this engagement of Pleukins, the Peptidyltransferred, block partly P-binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s as secondary subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should due to the local prevalence of the resistance to the resistance of Retapamulin at least some cases of infection seem to be considered by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the In-vitro Activity of retapamulin against S.aureus, regardless of whether the insulator were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of a non-response to S.aureus treatment the presence of tribes with additional virus factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine, Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study of healthy adults was applied 1% Retapamulin Saline daily under occlusion and placed on sharpened skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% retapamulin saline twice daily for 5 days to the topical treatment of secondary infected wounds, single plasma samples were gained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling tests were carried out on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before mediation and children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic recording of man after topical application of 1% saline on 200 cm2 has been shot down on 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / h / ml) 660-times lower than the Retapamulin for the PGP inhibition.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambient rix is used for protection against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) in children between the ages of 1 and 15 who are not immune to these two illnesses.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied as part of a vaccine existing from two doses, whereby the protection against hepatitis B may be reached only after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix should only be used when Immunization is caused by a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensures that the vaccination may be brought to an end from two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a rying dose against hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given.</seg>

<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes viruses and surface antigens as" "" "alien" "" "and produces antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambience rix contains the same components as the vaccine Twinrix Adut since 1996 and the vaccine licensed vaccine Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to protect the same disease, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are given as part of an existing vaccination to be administered.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because ambient rix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix Adults are also used as proof for the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective anticoncentric month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the efficacy of the vaccine is compared with six months and a 12 month interval between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix carried out a month after the last injection to the development of protective antideconcentration against hepatitis A and B between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of the Ambirix was similar to a six-month interval between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headaches, appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, maturation (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be applied to patients who may react hypersensitive to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission granted the Company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals. an approval for the Ambirix meeting in the entire company</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the edge dimmer with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered at the appointment of the choice and the second dose is administered after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a solicitation is desired both for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B, the corresponding monovalent vaccines can be vaccinated or combined with a combination-simp.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HBsAg) anti-hepatitis C anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HAV) anti-hepatitis B anti-hepatitis C anti-hepatitis vaccines are in the same size as after the vaccination with the respective monovalers vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet secured whether immuncompetent individuals who have addressed a vaccination against vaccination against vaccination, as they may also be protected in no longer visible antibodies by the immunological memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injectionists, the rare case of anaphylactic reaction, according to the gift of the vaccine, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a faster protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization sensor is recommended with the combination of combination, which contains 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of haemalysis patients and persons with the immune system's immune system, there is no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibody being achieved, so in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could lead to an optimal importer, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">At Thrombocytopenia or blood pressure interference, Ambient may be injected from the exception of subcutaneous subcutaneous, as it can occur following intramuscular administration to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix was given in the second year of a separate injection at the same time with a combined diphatic, tetanus- and azelophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV / HIB) or with a combined Masern- mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients suffering from immunosuressive therapy or in patients with immunotherapy, there may be no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study involving 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matures, gastroenteritis, headache and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in the former Thiomerang and preservative inocative inoculation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines were administered at a total of 1027 vaccinations at the age of 1 - including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants in the age of 12 and including 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared to the 3-doses of combination-simulation.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequency periods of pain and maturing on a calculation basis per vaccine dose Ambirix, but not based on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix at 50.7% of subjects, compared to 39.1% of subjects following the gift of a dose of 3 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination, 66.4% of subjects who had been given at the Ambirix, over pain, compared to 63.8% of the subjects that had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination-simp.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maturality was comparable high (i.e. about the total vaccination cycle of 39.6% of subjects, the Ambirix was obtained, compared with 36.2% of the subjects that received 3 doses of combination-simp).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of impregnated pain and maturiness was slight and comparable to that after administration of Combination simulations was observed with the 3-cans of vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old vaccinations, the occurrence of local reaction and general reactions in the Ambient group was comparable to that which was observed with the 3-doses of combined hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, for the 6- to 11-year old, however, at the Ambient vaccination, there was a common cause of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per progam.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccinations, which reported severe side effects during the 2-doses vaccination with Ambirix or during the 3-cans inocalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen, was statistically undifferent.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials carried out in vaccinations at the age of 1 to and including 15 years, the seroconement rates for anti-HAV 99,1% were taken after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serocacy rates for anti-hbs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- and including 15-year-olds, 142 two cans of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combinating foam with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">With the 289 people whose immunity was more valuable, the seroprotective rates (SP in the table below) was significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3-dose-imitant significantly higher than at Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1- and 11-year-olds after the completion of the full vaccine series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-cans inoculations with Ambirix or a 3-cans inoculations with a combination-simulated hepatitis B virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs-antibodies of at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix was detected in the 0-6 months of vaccination at the time of the immunization.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response to both antigens was comparable to both antigens, which was established in 3 doses with a combination of combination pulp, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis B surface antigen with a dose of hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- and including 15-year olds, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs-antibodies of 24 months after immunisation is comparable to the 0-12 month vaccinscheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix was given in the second year of a combined diphthie-, tetanus- and azelluhilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps-vaccinated vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed the current formulation of similar Seroprotective and serocon- rates as for earlier formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2787">The second vaccination of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is administered usually one month after the first dose and should give you a vaccine protection prior to ending the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix starts with people who are suffering from heavy bleeding problems, under the skin and not in the muscle. if you / your child is weakened due to a condition or treatment in your / her body's defense, or if you / your child will undergo a hemalysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the response of these persons on the vaccination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be needed to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambience rix is available in packages to 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packages to 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on data, which have become known for the issuance of the first permit for the public transport, CHMP stepped up that the benefit-risk ratio of the Ambirix remained positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">As the Ambirix was brought in only one member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonium can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with encapsulated Enzymopathy (brain damage due to high ammonium concentration) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonium is - split by several single doses to meals - swallowed by the food, or via a gastrostomifier (through the abdominal wall in the gastric duct) or a nose onde (through the nose into the gastric duct).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It could not be a comparative study, since ammonium could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a placebo, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonium may also cause appetite, stomach ache, irritability, headache, stomach ache, stomach ache, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor, or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) came to the conclusion that ammonium in patients with disorders of the urine cycle to high ammoniacic values effectively avoids.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "ammonium was approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "because of the condition of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indexed to all patients with which a complete enzyme has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late enzymatic form (complete enzymatic form, which manifests itself after the first stage of life) there is an indication for the use if a hypertext is hyperaortic encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with canceless, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein tolerance and for the growth and the development of daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to the previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of more than 20 kg and for growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer on a premature lack of carbamide phosphatase or ornithinkoscaris bamylase suffer the substitution of citruline or arginine in a dosing of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day required.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an Argininosuccinatric zinc deficiency need arginine in a dose of 0.4 to 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with hatch faults as there is a risk of causing Ösophagusulcera if the tablets are not immediately going into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 grams (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">In patients with congestiver cardiac insufficiency or serious renal insufficiency, as well as with sodium retention and edeformation, must be used only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because Metabolisation and discharge of sodium phenylbutyal is carried out via the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results concerning pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous injection of phenylacetat of young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg) it came to a slowdown of neuronal refining and to a increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and reduced number of working neurons in the brain and thus a disability of brain cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be noted whether phenylacetat are divorced in human milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated throughout the lactation (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients at least had a undesirable event (AU) and 78% of these adverse events was assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A likely toxic response to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18-year-old anoretical female patient who developed severe hypokalemia, armytopenia, peripheral new ropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdosing occurred at a 5-month old toddler at a single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms vary with accumulation of phenylacetat, which showed dosed dosing of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day with dosed limiting neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetat is a limetabolically active connection, which is conjugated by acetylacetylglutamine which is excreted through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Kerosometrically, phenylacetylglutamine (both compounds containing 2 nitric atoms); Phenylacetylglutamine is therefore used as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 Patients with disorders of the urine cycle can be assumed that for every gram the sodium phenylbutyrate can be produced between 0,12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifesto of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always inffists, and the disease itself led to death with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids, or with their nitric free anala in the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By haemalysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetat) it was possible to increase the survival rate newborn at postpartal (however, within the first monmonth) companion diagnostic diseases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and that had already been treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonic endcephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it came with many intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the Ornithinkoscarcra-deficiency), which were recovered from hyperammonium Encephalopathy and then permanently treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a proteinated diet were treated, the survival rate amounted to 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are also hardly reversible and in some cases further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacetat, which is conjugated in liver and kidney, with glutamine which is produced with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were obtained after the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat and patients with liver cirrhosis, of hemostasis and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also investigated in cancer patients after intravenous haybutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetat.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral individual dose of 5 g of sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentration of phenylbutyal were noted.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients suffering from urea-cycle defect or hemoglobinopathy was, according to different doses of phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day), the next morning no phenylacetat in the plasma is demonstrable.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three individual doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma level was five times higher than the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product Phenylacetylglutamine by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrate had no clastogenic effects (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is either taken orally (infants and children that have not swallow) any tablets or patients with sip faults or a garnish.</seg>

<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteine in plasma should be held within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer on a premature lack of carbamide phosphatase or ornithinkoscaris bamylase suffer the substitution of citruline or arginine in a dosing of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day required.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 grams (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="2858">Based on examinations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urine cycle can be assumed that for every gram the sodium phenylbutyrate can be produced between 0,12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are also hardly reversible, and in some cases further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral individual dose of 5 g of sodium phenylbutyrate in granulatform 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentration of phenylbutyal were noted.</seg>

<seg id="2862">This approach includes the small measuring spoon 0,95 g, the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the big measuring spoon 8.6 g Sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient must maintain this medicine by a probe, AMMONAPS can be dissolved before use even in water (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so they can accumulate nitrogen in the body after eating proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">When conducted in you laboratory tests, you must inform the physician that you are using AMMONAPS, as sodium phenylbutyrate can affect certain laboratory studies.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat patients with acute coronarsyndromes (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example unstable angina (a form of pain in chest pain with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "ST- Hebdo" (an anomal measured value at electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to the heart of patients with angina or heart attack to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients enrolled in the basic study of the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox is associated with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIA inhibitor (GPI, another medicine to prevent blood clots) with the traditional combination treatment with hepatocytes (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While PCI was often found a stent (a short tube that remains in the artery to prevent a lock) and they received additional medicines for preventing blood clots, such as Abciximab and Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or reascularization) after 30 days and one year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI was angiox in relation to all indicators as effective as Heparin, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox must not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive to the brain against Bivalirudine, other Hirudine or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Moreover, it may not be applied to patients who recently had a blood flow, as well as with heavy blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) came to the conclusion that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Medicines Company UK Ltd to provide approval for the marketing of angiox in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronarsyndromes (instabile angina / Non- ST-Hebdo infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency or an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is a intravenous bolt of 0,1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If one PCI is performed in another result, an additional Bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI can be resumed after clinical requirements the reduced incite dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous bolt of 0,75 mg / kg body weight and an infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Safety and efficacy of a single Bolus gift from Angiox was not examined and is not recommended, even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT once after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second strous of 0,3 mg / kg / body weight should be done.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the replacted and diluted drug should be carefully blended before application and administered intravenously to the bolus dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT score is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which should be subjected to a PCI (whether with bivalirudine against ACS or not), a lower fusion rate of 1,4 mg. / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is below 225 seconds, a second bolusdose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt is to be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which led to the approval of III- PCI-study (Replace-2), the ACT score was 5 minutes after the gift of the bivalirudine-Bolus without a dose adaptation of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 For patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also dialytic patients is contraindicated in angiox (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the termination of the intravenous medicine of unquestionable hepatocytes or 8 hours after the termination of the subcutaneous injection of low-molecular hepatocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any other components or against Hirudine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a disturbance of hemostasis and / or irreversible cardiovascular disease. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialytic patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment to monitor symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if Bivalirudin is given in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even when PCI-patients occur under Bivalirudine most of the bleeding associated with arterial points of points can occur in patients who occur in a subcutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) during the treatment of principle everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taken warfarin and treated with Bivalirudine, there should be a monitoring of the INR value (International normalised Ratio) to ensure that the value is reached after finishing the treatment with Bivalirudin again prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge about the action of anticoagulania (Heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or densrombocytes), it can be assumed that these substances are increasing the risk of blood.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination with Bivalirudine aggregation or anticoagstimulants, clinical and biological hemostasis are to be controlled regularly in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental studies are inadequate for the impact on the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the binding or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomly assigned to Bivalirudine alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudine plus GPI / IIIA inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unquestionized Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPI / IIIA inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalirudine-Group as well as in patients treated with Heparin, it was more common in women and in patients over 65 years more than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding were defined according to ACUITY and Timi standards for heavy bleeding like in Table 2 footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both lightweight and heavy bleeding performed significantly less than in the groups with hepatitis plus GPI / IIIA-inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPI / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY serious bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemostasis of ≥ 4 g / dl with no apparent bleeding eye, reduction of hemoglobin (≥ 3 g / dl) with known blood pressure, reoperation because of blood circulation, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed blood-localizations, which appeared in more than 0.1% (occasionally), "other" puncture points, retroperitoneal, gastroshone, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bivalirudin at 6000 patients who underwent a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudine Group as well as in patients treated with Heparin, it was more common in women and in patients over 65 years more than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both lightweight and heavy bleeding had significantly fewer than bivalirudine in significantly less than in the comparative group under Heparin plus GPI / IIIA inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported in practice after complete application and are classified into table 6 in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdose the treatment with Bivalirudine is immediately collapsed and the patient used to monitor blood flow in relation to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudine, a direct and specific thrombin, which binds to both the catalytic hub and an agion region of Thrombin, regardless of whether Thrombin is tied in the liquid phase or to the clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin to Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible because thrombin soutdated the binding of Bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4 slowly, thereby regenerates the function of the active center of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, Bivalirudine with serum of patients, in which it had come to heparininduced crombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS), was unable to induce thrombotic aggregation reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients Bivalirudine shows a dose-dependent pathoagulatory effect involving the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR, and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In case of the patients following a PCI, an additional Bolus of 0,5mg / kg of Bivalirudine should be given and infusion for the duration of the surgery to 1.75mg / kg / h should be increased.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, unquestionably Heparin or Enoxaparin was given in accordance with relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronarsynsyndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST-Hebdo infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomised to obtain a GPIIb / IIIA Inhibitor at the beginning of the angiography (at the time of Randomization) or at the PCI.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need to treat the treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected into the abdominal wall, injected or injected into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or administered infusion with a insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to the body of glucose (sugar) in the blood or cannot process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from humanity, and the change means that it acts faster and a shorter mode of activity has more than a short-effective human being.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-effective insulin for patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body can produce no insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and a study with 572 children between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In case of type 2 diabetes, where the body can't work effectively, Apidra was examined in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the concentration of glycoiled hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was found compared to a lowering of 0.14% for insulin shots.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction in the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.9% of human normal dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be applied in patients who are possibly hypersensitive to insulin or any of the other components, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The cans of Apidra must be adapted, if it is administered jointly with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH to provide a permit for marketing Apidra in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is applied as a subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall, thigh, or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the range of abdominal muscles.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose load capacity and reduced insulin delivery, the insulin requirement for patients with a limitation of liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of active strength, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or production method can undergo a change of insulin delivery.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or termination of a treatment, particularly in patients with an insulable diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoazide; these conditions are potentially threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or a insulin dose should be carried out under strict medical supervision and can make a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the active insulin profile and can therefore change in changing the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To the substances which increase the bleeding activity and increase the slope to hypoglyphics, include oral antidiabetics, anoxetine-converting enzyme (Mao) inhibitor, pentoxifylline, propoxyphal, propoxylic and sulfa antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Additionally, under the effect of sympaolytics such as beta-blockers, Clonidin, guanethidin and reserves, the symptoms of renrenal opposites may be weakened or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and human insulin regarding the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin shots occur in human breast milk, but in general, insulin is neither into breast milk, nor is it absorbed after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Changes are listed in clinical studies that are listed in clinical studies, grouped after system subclasses and subordinated according to the frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10.000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10.000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10.000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10.000; very rare (frequency on the basis of available data not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual guarage or weakness, confusion, concentration disorders, more excessive Hun- ger, changes of eyesight, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Will silently switch to switch the injection of injector inside the injector may occur in the sequence of a liqueystrophy on the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglychests with intramuselessness can be given by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a correspondingly trained person, or treated by a doctor's intravenous gift.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a gluing injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to identify the Ural cause of severe hypoglycemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose levels (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibiting the glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous squir- take care of insulin shots faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu- manem normal.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, TUS showed a dose of proportional, glucose load-ranging from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg, and with 0,3 e / kg or more, a proportional increase in a gluing effect, exactly like the human being.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-insulin has a double so-fast response entry such as normal humanities and achieves a total of about 2 hours earlier than the human being.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was obvious that a similar postprandiglycemic control in 2 minutes before the meal is achieved like with human normal dosage, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If the islanlulcer was geared in 2 minutes before the meal, a better postpranal control was given as with human normal dosage, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If the insulin is turned around 15 minutes after the meal, it will be a comparable glycemic control as in human normal dosage, which is given 2 Mi- grooves prior to the meal (see figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">At the beginning of the meal, insulin is 2 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the meal was given before the meal (figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal surgery, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - previously) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">At the beginning of the meal, insulin is 15 minutes (GLULISIN - after the beginning of a meal, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - previously) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
