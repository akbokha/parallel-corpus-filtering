if a part of the text is selected , only this part is translated to the entire &amp; URL .
mechan@@ ically translations are only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . Bab@@ el@@ fish is in the best case a gross translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , translation of translations will not make important decisions , without checking the translation be@@ fore@@ hand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only websites on the Internet can be translated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other texts should be translated directly on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bab@@ el@@ fish page itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where you can insert texts directly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the package &amp; package includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; however , they offer some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the usage of some functions by &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or while making them easier .
for more information about using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions are available in the booklet to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Settings extensions ... Open the map card tools and select the desired modules there .
this is a list of standard configuration modules from the package k@@ de ; add @-@ ons . please note that there may be more modules installed on your system if you have any additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for crash , or the list of de@@ stor@@ k , if present , delete .
the module In@@ sight filter ( also called Fol@@ der filter ) can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ changeable Extras . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory to different types of filters .
to view the DO@@ M tree view in the Con@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and thus open a new window with the DO@@ M which is currently displayed . as pres@@ et@@ ting starts the ad with the root name of the document , example : the document@@ ar@@ ie , all other no@@ des are of this root no@@ des .
the module &amp; fs@@ view ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for a further view for objects with the M@@ IME type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbolic and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the pec@@ uli@@ arity of &amp; fs@@ view ; there is a representation of the size of objects in til@@ ted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must possess the sum of the size of the ordered objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; fs@@ view ; reflects the size of a file or a folder , whereby the size of a folder is specified as the sum of the size of the entries in it . consequently , large files , even then can easily be detected as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX operating system .
in &amp; fs@@ view ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for simpler navigation use the rect@@ angle of useful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched from view mode can be either deep for easy detection of inc@@ en@@ tive depth or the illustration of another file fig . such as name , owner , group or M@@ IME type .
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ elled with the different characteristics of the appropriate file or folder . for each property you can specify if enough space is available , or if the area is displayed by sub@@ ordin@@ ate boxes ( whereby the area errors are displayed by restrictions on the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . in addition , you can specify the relative position of the lab@@ eling in the rect@@ angle .
in case algorithms for tre@@ em@@ aps should be kept , that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; fs@@ view , this goal is not always available , and this frame will not always be available , which is less space for the frame , if the rect@@ angle is square .
as separation of the surface of a single entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries , the implementation is provided for lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space loss by setting the boxes that are possible square . the best methods in this respect are rows , columns or recur@@ sive second .
you can specify the minimal space for an entry above the menu entry in the area . instead , a space pattern in the area of the parent &apos;s entry is drawn in order to view that this area is covered by an sub@@ ordin@@ ate entry .

although digi@@ came ; simple to use , there is dozens of professional skills available . it works complete with 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion with li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G @-@ export and ICC @-@ colour management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; on the camera or lens , which can be searched for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; Programs is also &amp; digi@@ ous ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on support of the end users . they should therefore report problems and improvements .
&amp; digi@@ came ; tries to make use of problems or suggestions for it as easy as possible for it . if you are using this link , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . all required information are already registered here . please follow the instructions below to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ came ; is a project supported by a community . that means , we want to answer a regular user of &amp; digi@@ ous users ; therefore , we would like to answer any other users of &amp; digi@@ ous users ; and hopefully , we will soon answer any questions of other users . in this mailing list , however , tell us this language , you should be powerful .
you may also visit the digi@@ plug website , in order to find news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ ous ;
the best start to participate on &amp; digi@@ came ; registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for announ@@ cing in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ came ; .
if you start &amp; digi@@ ous ; for the first time , you will be asked where to specify your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , distant or remote folders . simply enter the folder icon , or select a folder to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data retri@@ eval is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ came ; in addition , you will additionally use an Al@@ ben@@ library . settings digi@@ plug .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , which contains images as the base folder . &amp; digi@@ appear ; viewed each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture is displayed on this folder . during the search of the folder you will see a progress indicator as this :
&amp; digi@@ ous ; dur@@ st recur@@ sively exp@@ el the libr@@ arian path in all its depth . you cannot enter a sub@@ folder , unless you are included in hidden folders . this can be done by inser@@ ting a point in front of the folder &apos;s name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list will not take photos as symbols . this will be used by clicking on the folder icon . this will then be used as an album icon . for more details please refer to the albums section .
once you have configured the Base Fol@@ der , you can set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My albums and My keywords in order to manage your photos in the albums .
Roh@@ dat@@ or support : in case you use the raw mode of your camera , therefore &amp; digi@@ ous ; possibly , it is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu help Roh@@ k@@ amer@@ a@@ assist .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
a simple to use camera bed is provided , so that you can connect with your digital camera and directly with your digital camera . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work together with &amp; digi@@ plug .
modern digital cameras distinguish themselves through the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for the actual transmission to the machine . the camera is then used as a disk drive . the connection can also use via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ came ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for digital cameras , which support a steadily increasing number of cameras for digital cameras , which also supports a steadily increasing number of more than 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports transm@@ itting images from digital cameras on machines and other peri@@ pher@@ als without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calcul@@ ator . since photos in general are large files and transm@@ is@@ sions over the serial port are slowly out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports those cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be copied with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support . EX@@ IF support is required from several lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to see any thumb@@ nails or creating the creation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; digi@@ came ; is how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plug @-@ ins Interface Project ( Hand@@ book ) is a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ plug ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ v@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manip@@ ulate images in virtually any way as it can be a user . your advantage is that it is considerably simpler , &amp; digi@@ came ; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ plug ; even perform .
to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either move the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or replace in full screen mode using F@@ 11 and C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drawing and storage of images works anywhere : you can place a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ma , over the horizontal separ@@ at@@ line or another application window . the only restri@@ ction is that a picture cannot be used in keywords , data list or search .
- a file list allows you to un@@ rest the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Movies and Audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . so the fil@@ tering is displayed on the file name only if this ox is displayed as a symbol view . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ ign dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ g quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums ; these albums are stored in a single album , where they are stored on the hard disk , according to the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ features or after the date that the album has been created first . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have installed a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly to an album . you can also add an album from Import pictures . you can also add a screenshot directly to an album . select your album after import@@ ing screen shot .
to copy or move an image from one album to another or move , you can select the photo with the mouse to the target album and fall there . in the appearing menu you will need to move or copy multiple photos . simply select all the photos and move it to the target album .

the album date : be used if you sort the albums by date with view albums by date .
the buttons are older , average , the latest : they put the date on the end of the album , the newest image or the average record . this will first try to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF data . if this fails , the date of the last change in this folder will be used instead .
if you first came up with an album in &amp; digi@@ ous ; Open the first picture in the album as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ad quot ; . this is probably the first picture in the album to remember . sometimes , the first picture in the album is not representative and you want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the image with the right mouse button , and in con@@ tex@@ ting quot ; select . in addition , you can drag the picture to the album in the list in order to put it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in one collection and collections cannot be dis@@ regarded .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; Supp@@ orted by Key@@ word for individual pictures in the main window . album collections have another effect . they can always use all photos of the album . you can , of course , use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images are displayed in this Album in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lu@@ pin heads in the tool@@ bar .
when you open a record the first time you will have to wait for a short while the thumb@@ nails will be generated while you can recre@@ ate all thumb@@ nails in the menu View Extras .
information on each image will appear below the associated preview pane . which information is available ; you can set up over Settings digi@@ ous ; set up the albums here and customize the area of thumb@@ nails to suit your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help you to rest at the moment . when you leave the cursor a moment over a picture . the display shows the most important features including all the tags of a photo . the screenshot above in the main window shows such a window .
photos and tags are all about it came on &amp; digi@@ ous ; albums and tags allow you to organise your pictures as you do . the image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements in the menu bar . you have the choice between the view of the pictures , a slide show or the editing of the images .
you can open the image processing with a photo , initi@@ ating either F@@ 4 image ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... select a tutorial on how to edit your photos . with the image processing you can view your photos and edit them .

you should consider that it can come to problems with other image processing programs in the image contained in the image . some programs do not save this data with , if you save the changed image . this will get this information from EX@@ IF data and IP@@ TC data such as orientation , bl@@ ending , etc .
&amp; digi@@ came ; two ways to rotate . the sim@@ pl@@ est thing is to push and spin the right button on the right button . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photos , you can click with the right mouse button on the Pre@@ view and F2 key of the context menu . note that you will retain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ ti@@ f , &amp; etc . ) .
if you have a photo from &amp; digi@@ ous ; de@@ gl@@ aze , it is moved to the tr@@ ash@@ can of &amp; k@@ de ; F8 picture del@@ etion or dec@@ f if you prefer to be really del@@ eting , you can use it by holding Shift ; unlock .
the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ p@@ quot ; organizes your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ plug ; used for either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the image view below . you can select days or weeks in the date list below to show you only the photos of the selected days .
photos with keyword provides a flexible and powerful way to organize your photos and catalogues . as soon as a keyword is assigned a photo , the photo can be found by choosing this keyword or a search .
when a keyword is selected , all photos that have been selected with this keyword will be shown .
tags can be sorted into a hier@@ arch@@ ical tree . here you can also arrange parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords ; I can assemble , so that you can find the keywords that you can find easily .
the key words are stored in a database for quick access and access keywords in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , but you can also use your keywords in other programs , as soon as digi@@ came ; the images are noticed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can add new keywords , by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My keyword &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; or click on an existing word . if you clicked on a new keyword , this will be the word word for this keyword . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and delete it . if you delete a keyword , the photograph itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photograph .
you can change the position of a tag by drawing it to the required position in the tree and place there . then a menu that gives you the option to move by . a keyword can be only once a tree .
you can change the properties of a tag by clicking with the right mouse button and edit it in context menu keyword . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ;
to select another photo as an album icon , you must select the image with the right mouse button and select in context menu as album display . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list in order to put it as a symbol .
um &amp; digi@@ ous ; s functionality provided by means of tag , you must first take your photos with keyword . this can be used on two types . as soon as you have chosen photos with a keyword , you can also pull it with the right mouse button on the thumb@@ nail to view the pictures and point out of the keyword menu item .
you can choose a photograph with any number of tags . the photo will be displayed as soon as you choose one of the keyword in a picture , one for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event in which it was made etc .
once you have signed a photo with keyword , this will appear below the preview of the picture in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can open with the right mouse button the context menu of the photos and from the keywords menu . the menu only shows the tags that were assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a tim@@ eless hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . to select a drop frame , you must just click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . thus all the corresponding images are displayed in the main window .
in the below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will then appear in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamp and in the future even more .
Neb@@ end er Search box is a small lamp that will find the green if the search is found here . if you click here the fil@@ tering is displayed and all pictures are displayed again , then the lamp is red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the rider in the left side bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you can open this , but you can search for a simple search box as the above mentioned above . after you saved it as search crit@@ erion which you have been saved as search crit@@ erion . after you have been saved , it appears in the list .
if you are satisfied with your selection , hit the head OK and the search will be performed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your search in my search list , select only the appropriate entry in my search list and select one option in his context menu .
if you select searching , the form to input the search will be returned with the previously introduced search information . if you select an extended search , the dialog for the advanced search will be available . more information is available for you in section The tool to expand your search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select the context menu .
the Advanced Search provides an extended search form with many search parameters available , which you can look for in certain fields by &amp; digi@@ ous ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to add the options for search query in the Alb@@ end@@ at@@ enb@@ ank . each option can be added to the search group or delete it . each option can be added to others about the logical operations all ... , A ... , No ... or At least ... . furthermore , you can search the type &amp; quot ; AND NO@@ TH@@ ING ;
&amp; digi@@ ous ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows images to compare and compare these signatures ; depending on the difference between two pixels , the more they correspond to them . this technique is applied in three fields .
similar entries : this is a range in which you can drop each picture to find a similar . by means of a swelling can slide the result selection , then you will open it over the symbol of un@@ precise search in the left side bar , then you can open it there .
sk@@ etch : a sk@@ etch of the sk@@ etch : draw a fast sk@@ etch and &amp; digi@@ ous sk@@ etch ; find the matching images . also here a s@@ wan can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ tool . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to drag and move it . all images within this coordinates are filtered and displayed . this process of course requires your pictures Geo @-@ data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your Geo @-@ filters . this will then be added for a later use of the list below . it works like a live Ge@@ o@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ came ; provides an LED in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . he works with all supported image files , also raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L The light table added from the context menu . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ ous window , main window is , you can easily open the light table with an L Extras table .
from the thumb@@ nail you can pick up the images that you want to compare to the left or right area of the window . if you want to sync your copy from the tool@@ bar and then perform other operations on one of the images , you will also compare the same aspect of the picture . you can also compare the same range of the two images .
another mode is better suited to navigate quickly from a picture series . if you use in combination with the tool@@ bar , the two first pictures are automatically displayed in the left side to display it in the left side . this is simplified by a number of similar pictures .
of course , normal sol@@ dering reactions work directly out of the panel , e.g. F@@ 4 file editing ....
all picture information from the right side@@ bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . for example , simply visual differences with exposure data can be linked .
in the lower end of each unit you find a built @-@ in swivel function which allows you to swing to the visible arrows . to view the visible area of the image you have to click and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both pictures show the same image area .
zoom lenses work exactly like in other views . simply use the zoom knob in the images or C@@ trl @-@ mouse to zoom in the picture and forth . this happens in both images if you are viewing in the preview mode .
what is a digital inventory management - away from the process ? digital inventory equals each part of the process after the image has been taken , sc@@ ans or digital photos will result in a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not make this in systematic and efficient way .
we &apos;ll give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to secure your pictures , find , protect , protect and use photos . we look at the procedure for digital photographs depicting the &amp; digi@@ plug . we look at the procedure for digital photographs and use , back , secure , secure , secure , keep , storing and export images files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes up , inde@@ xed , categor@@ ized , sec@@ ts , transform , conf@@ ected and exports contents to a mon@@ et@@ ary or cultural value .
metadata is defined as data to data . metadata is according to your definition data to provide information about or documentation of other data provided by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t need to find what many photos you have , then use not &amp; digi@@ ous ; . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use fast searching and secure arch@@ iving to access you with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and know before you should maintain anything in your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure . you must decide if others have access to your photos or on a network drive &amp; etc . note that you will have to change to a bigger drive .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location . if you have enough photos , you will then use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export a folder for pictures you want to print or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements like ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , arch@@ iving , work processes , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years will have 95 % archives and 5 % work files and you will not want to re @-@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes forkli@@ fts easier . split new of old files .
the separation of original and work@@ places simpli@@ fies backup strategy and migration . they will always know if you are looking for an original or derived picture .
we also recommend adding the metadata in the file page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ plug . if you forget , this ensures that EX@@ IF data and IP@@ TC data can be stored into the file , then you can subsequently select the metadata from the database to select the respective point in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what if you want to change it ; them include a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work starts because you should now select all photos , label and an evaluation . of course you can select all the images that will need the same attribute . this makes sense , as you can concentrate on the best photos .
let &apos;s now talk with references , keywords , as you are using other programs . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import Catal@@ og@@ ised images from another source of embedded boxes , then &amp; digi@@ came ; automatically build the tree to the right place . the revers@@ ed hier@@ archy in the tree is no problem and can easily be carried out by the following keywords : updates by &amp; digi@@ ous ; updated while keeping the sub@@ trees .
the graphic shows like different mer@@ g@@ einf@@ o . this is a very rough representation , since each blo@@ c of metadata in truth consists of many sections . file name and calendar data are characteristics of all images .
enough of the keyword - the next section refers to lab@@ eling or comments , the third important tool for catal@@ og@@ ing your metadata .
you want to simply let most anyone know your photos , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are certainly interested in your pictures .
check out this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look closer to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Norman@@ die 60 years after the landing . Wow ! you might even have memories , the historical period is again present , you may even listen to the silence . the lab@@ eling has changed your perception of this panorama .
for others viewing your photos , the title might be more important than the picture itself . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is transferred to the viewer to help Him to understand Him about the motive that you can understand what you understand .
in order if a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself .
with &amp; digi@@ came ; you can use any text in an internation@@ alised Alpha@@ bet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) as lab@@ eling . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE will even produce a spell chec@@ ker at the same time . K@@ DE will also tell you the label chosen for the label and / or title of the Web Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . so you have to tell the story for the opening act no second time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with images the train de@@ parts the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
the possibilities to use the ge@@ ol@@ ocation calls already become countless in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , you can repeat your travels through pictures with ge@@ ographic information . you can also export K@@ ML files using Google Earth . you can also export the images using Google Earth . you can also export the images to Google on G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word play with copyright and den@@ otes the practice the copy@@ rights to remove any restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also valid in all changed versions , also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information came in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ ; as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should add your name or the name of the photographer , for example , if it is not desired , the name of a company or organization can be used . after that , it should not be changed . this field does not support sem@@ ic@@ mas or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
Aut@@ onom@@ itel ( syn@@ onym for author ) : linked to the author . this field contains the name of the photographer , freelance photographer or independent photographer . as a note to the car field , this field must be completed .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the vend@@ or field to identify who is offered by the photo . if the photographer has been shown here , these organizations might be listed here . if the picture is shown here , the group / agency will be shown here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not have a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator , this , in the picture embedded metadata , can delete or modify the solution to this problem . for private individuals this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ plug is provided in the near future such a module for forkli@@ fts .
topics : record errors , record cut , black@@ out , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ageing of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , des@@ per@@ ation prevention , lifetime , data size , widespread super@@ st@@ ition
of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same as you can pass through traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it concerns problems with the so @-@ called new media .
Kro@@ ell On@@ track , the biggest data recovery firm in the world , has some interesting statistics which cause a loss of data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these c@@ auti@@ ous must be handled and you can no longer buy CDs and DVDs in arch@@ iving quality . there are also offers over gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself . whether you believe that lies in your mess@@ aging space .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you can use good dis@@ cos and good recording devices . the best DVD recordings are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you &apos;re getting a lot more reliable , so that &apos;s why choose the right choice .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to mistakes , even if you are just writing a control mechanism around itself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for the form@@ atting and the control sum@@ s . despite this massive protection they are required for chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for defective CDs and DVDs , there &apos;s a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that works miracles on CDs and DVDs . however , it is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disk disks , hard drives , flash drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs appear to capture the format war against HD DVD and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual player DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs , of course also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . if you like to check the media with a description , date &amp; author and then check the data on the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that may read this media .
Disk@@ manufacturers retain your statistics for themselves . their manufacturing facilities include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study about error mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ f@@ law study
shortly , Dis@@ ks stay on the longest when you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . with lower temperature figures , errors do not determine the most common cause of trouble . some of SM@@ ART fixes the most common cause . this is especially Les@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and publishing count . the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years .
this involves the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses are normally produced without big problems .
while most electrical devices do not make a lot of accounts , it looks different in devices with computer chips and high speed processes . these ab@@ normal@@ ities can cause serious damage , hardware and hardware defects . so protect the mother@@ boards and other defects . so protect themselves from the un@@ avoid@@ able which leads to loss of time and money .
the most common protection against black@@ heads is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of energy saving . it is normally compens@@ ated in the form of a plug @-@ bar . however , remember that not every plug @-@ bar also contains a sur@@ ge protection .
if you look for an over@@ voltage protection , you should consider that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this ensures a certain minimum of protection . you should also ensure that it protects the protection against lightning and protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can use to your machine , you should also ensure that all peri@@ pher@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage calls that also contain a phone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity to the co@@ axial cable of the cable modems and the TV menu .
if you have a notebook , you will need a portable sur@@ ge protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . thus , you are ideal for traveling .
while a over@@ voltage protection protects your system from smaller variations in the power lines it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of few seconds can result in the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful in an un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
besides the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically shut down battery energy if a power out@@ age occurs . some models will even allow them to work even further down to the system . if you have a US@@ V you should be sure that it fulfil@@ s the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
remember the potential risk of calcul@@ ating your computer system and compare his security in power problems with the costs to avoid them . this is only a small price difference if you &apos;re considering how good your computer is protected . at the end , you should always remember all cables to tr@@ ample before you go to holiday .
Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - Simple Storage Service . you can use this as a Drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amounts of data .
however , compared to the hard drives at home , however , very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . furthermore , you have to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow internet .
solutions are therefore only suited as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is no general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and Photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures at full resolution online , in case of Flickr dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited storage that should be checked in reality .
data protection are very secure from the point of view of data backup . transmission errors are automatically adjusted by the TCP protocols and the big companies offer a backup and a distribution memory . therefore , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ safe .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transm@@ is@@ sions are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive .
worst of this is that no one says when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you have been destroyed in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data way than that of your machine .
un@@ reliable networks are a further source of transmission lu@@ sts , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . with normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not especially affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of defects per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle and highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one of the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is available soon for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is still not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss during the notebook and 46 % with the work@@ bench systems . Not@@ ebooks already the proportion of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most vulner@@ able ones . currently , there is no harm to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been sigh@@ ted for many times .
open source file systems are less vulner@@ able to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ F@@ s , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to give the common file systems . a very good English article can be found here .
Journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden period is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file is not completely stored before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human mistakes are the main causes of data loss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 Bl@@ ending settings from the fundamental physical limits . it is meant that the technology continues to develop a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and sound characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ apixel cameras . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more or@@ ized . even DSLR cameras have their limit in 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DSLR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive is currently available for 100 &amp; Euro ; so don &apos;t make anyone used for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often referred to one plan and test this backup before you might be any dangerous like the re@@ installation of your OS , the exchange of boards or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash hit you if the drive was not connected to the moment .
a disaster closes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget plane gap : fire , water , electricity , children and rob@@ ber@@ y are dangerous enough for your data . they normally concern a whole room or the whole house .
therefore , des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs to the neighboring house , in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as above already mentioned is a common reason for a loss of data despite backup the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that should be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without histor@@ ies and represents a complete copy at one time .
differenti@@ ation : a backup of files that have been changed since the last complete backup . provides a complete snap@@ shot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differenti@@ ation .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup . creates original status at any time again which such a backup was made . this backup is the next one with the exception that it just sli@@ pped and not going continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily setup your machine . in contrast to script controlled FTP sites or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only the difference between files that really changed . this happens and if you want to enhance the security of ssh .
backup important images directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or other visual media .
this approach will be enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review .
topics : metadata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC data , affiliate , memory , scal@@ ability , media , reproduction of images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , viewing devices , ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable images will survive the next 40 year , that is approximately the time span in which you are really interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predic@@ table because of your nature , you must consider all that today is going to be treated with caution and evaluate during the time . unfortunately , there are no other way to ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible . the less variations you have in the past are so much easier to evaluate the issues of the future .
this question should actually be answered with the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is currently available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , then keep it on and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : each time you change your machine architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should review your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the expert pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with you and you want to enlarge the area you want . if nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new record :
check the d@@ mes@@ g command , if your new record was detected by the system , but hang it in .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / S@@ DC &amp; dollar ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in M@@ B@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and reis@@ er@@ fs &amp; dollar ; resident / dev / sad@@ min # change the size of departure if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task becomes easier by year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format dis@@ appears slowly from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG has been designed as an open source standard which should replace the GIF . however , there can be much more . it &apos;s more fun , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata and full transparency . P@@ NG can use Gam@@ ma@@ - and Chrom@@ atic data for an improved colour configuration , but not as many as TIFF and we would like to recommend this format to save your images .
TIFF was widely used as an image format . TIFF can store images in un@@ compressed format or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression salt . a problem is , however , that this format is adapted to many people . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types of cameras .
DN@@ G The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a license @-@ free and open format format developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G is now based on the need to use metadata . a hand@@ ful camera controller is now available to DN@@ G and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon even sometime .
this may be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe its XML based X@@ MP technology introduced to c@@ ot the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is allowed with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored that for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers prefer to archive a copy of your photo , mostly in the shell format , as it stores the metadata separately from the image file and as seen before . therefore , you should consider whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put everything there together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of applications and business models . in the D@@ C@@ MI activities , work groups and workshops , standard conferences and workshops , standard services and educational efforts to achieve extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the pictures on the camera are designed to use this as temporary f@@ use .
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save them in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a complex editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images with &amp; digi@@ plug , then you should add the metadata again . these were cut off by the other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . then export them into MPEG , use in MPEG , use in contact page , print &amp; etc .
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ous ; in the Add a Photos to an album you will find a description as you have already on your hard drive , but the camera @-@ interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your album tank .
for your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; in order to use , connect the camera to the display mode and turn on it . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you launch the camera @-@ interface , this will take a while with your camera . if the connection is made , a Fer@@ tig indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will display . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to any entry . with the lateral bars and metadata in the camera @-@ interface you can see the properties of a single entry or metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and the photographic information that internally are stored by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that on some digital cameras not all information is available .
the tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer instructions , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as in the metadata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ ous ; or the image processing . note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is clicking on the button download and then download the selection from all photos . this download the photos from your camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ ous ; and we suggest you to check if the pictures are securely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , please select the desired with the default selection methods of &amp; k@@ de . once you chose the photos , use the button selected to be selected until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option new to download is available . these images have been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ ous ; in this case the new images are displayed with a star at the front window . if you select this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
if you use the buttons you can download all or selected files , a dialog with which you can select the target album will be displayed in which the photos can be stored in the section My albums are displayed in the section My Albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ came ; downloads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photographs you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all of them by clicking the button del@@ eting all . if you want to delete only some , then you must first select it and then delete the chosen Del@@ ete .
please note that there are no way that you have deleted from the camera , you &apos;ll be sure to delete the photos . if you want to delete the camera from the camera , you should carefully check if you want to delete the camera target , as this is much faster .
cameras are used as a fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos often not particularly meaningful name . this can normally rever@@ t after the photos from the camera . this can be useful to double fil@@ en@@ ames in the same album . so it can be useful , the date and time when the image is done to integrate in the file name .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and flip the image and for date bas@@ kets . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created per day .
the options during the transfer will open three further options , which are stored before the photos on the record are stored . if you select , the respective entries are copied from the EX@@ IF data into IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , for example , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % % m@@ - % d % H : % M : to do this option add date &amp; time . for more adjustments you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the camera file name , you will have the option to change the file names in lower@@ case letters . or in upper@@ case letters , if you prefer .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ plug ; used for a picture , will display the camera in preview . your settings are stored and automatically used when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; can use all the information on the orientation of the camera to the time point of admission . not all cameras make this information ready . in section page bar metadata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally turned on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information ; the photo in the original orient@@ ated . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the automatic rotation in the lower range of the window .
if your camera provides information on the date when the photo was made available , you can use this information in the target album . all pictures with the same date are based on image data . in the section page bar Meta @-@ data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally off , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ ous ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , use the button Advanced and then select the dates based under the window at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to their camera is the button downloading . then choose up@@ loading . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de appears where you can select the files you want to upload . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ plug ; you , where the pictures will be loaded high . select the folder selection dialog for the camera . choose OK to launch the upload . the pictures are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Pos@@ iti@@ oning System ) is used as a general term in this document , which can be displayed in length and lat@@ itude and which can be displayed on a map . the determination of the data can be performed by the US GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photograph@@ ers it can be interested in combining a picture with a precise ge@@ ographic site . not everyone uses an aircraft to photograph an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental , police , police , architectural offices and real estate mak@@ ler can use this ability .
if you have forgotten that , where exactly the photo was taken , you can click with a click to open the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ous user ; if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ous user , if you want to document the location of the photos , it is good to save the position data of a photos .
the question is , how come the GPS data in the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 is supported in these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , via a re@@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic information ( manual ) and lastly via manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has a GPS unit integrated . but there are a few working with GPS receivers working together . either as a card module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR ri@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading of GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or G@@ PS@@ Babel . you must save these data in the GP@@ X format , as this is the only format supported by the module to ge@@ ographic mapping .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same as &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lat@@ itud@@ inal or other data , then you can use this script using the Ex@@ if@@ Tool of Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs of hair@@ styl@@ ed coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street species . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish that show all navigation data for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ came ; tries to set so much control over his work processes as possible . in order to access these settings , you need to change the settings dialog . you can switch between these settings . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left page .
select Action can be set to view or start image processing . thereby , you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ ous ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , displayed standards and copyright . these data will automatically be written into the respective IP@@ TC data fields . also , with a database synchron@@ isation , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
aut@@ ology is a syn@@ onym for author : this field should be the professional name of the photographer . this can be names like e.g. a photographer , freelance photographer or independent photographer . as this is a closer description to the car field , this must be also filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for vend@@ ors : use this field to specify the photo . this must be registered here , if this is a message agency e.g. a Reuters , or Associated Press . if the picture is a storage picture , the group or agency should be included here .
the IP@@ TC counter@@ s save the data into the respective IP@@ TC counter@@ s . thereby , the metadata remains permanently contained in the picture and are not only available in the database of &amp; digi@@ ous ; these metadata also contains other programs and may be imported into &amp; digi@@ ous ; imported without getting lost .
image descri@@ bing as embedded labels ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures ; this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can add to your photos , with the text embedded in the images . this can be inscri@@ bed on images that have already inscri@@ bed ; over@@ written by the &amp; digi@@ plug .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information appearing on the main window in the main window . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ came ; display file extensions , which has no such expan@@ sions , has been ignored by &amp; digi@@ ous ; ignored .
the default settings can be restored , by pressing the button on the right of each category .
the settings of the illuminated by &amp; digi@@ plug ; can be switched on this page on the standard values . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have a look at the entire image , you can only get better viewing results .
by default the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can switch them here . you can switch the tool@@ bar when you use image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing this view@@ point can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images are coded in higher resolution than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia about the previous explanation .
with Set@@ P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not decrease the image quality , as P@@ NG is used for a quick calcul@@ ator . if you have a quick calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 high compression .
with the option to comp@@ ress TIFF @-@ files , you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate compression sal@@ ms for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF image . it has no effect on the image quality as the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is freely working .
with setting los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you have written the los@@ sy setting , the ratio of quality loss and file size is far better than at the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ came , image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , the image processing is very fast to manip@@ ulate your photos . with this dialog you can change the image processing settings .
the default value is that all green pixels are equal in sensitive to sensitive to ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option a little bit soft , this option is drawing a little bit soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 image patterns with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white powder is used immediately , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard it is set to set a solid colour balance , which was photograph@@ ed on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . in four steps , this option is ignored for more details . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the sh@@ lich@@ ter , so the parts of your camera are burned as transparent and white in the settings . simply use the setting @-@ in white in the settings . this setting color produces some unusual results as it shows the sh@@ lich@@ ter in various ro@@ at@@ ars . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the sh@@ lich@@ ens .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not so fast glu@@ ed like green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares in the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question how much colour or white you want .
if you select the option , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted individually for each image .
put the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ as according to your taste . you probably have to put it somewhat higher than the standard 1 . this can also be done later in the picture options of &amp; digi@@ ous ; order to keep the time for the demo board , so you should be conservative .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ Cap algorithm is a digital image process to draw a complete picture from the particles @-@ filtered image sensor that provides many cameras and that a matrix of color@@ less pixels is available . this algorithm is also known as CFA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction .
&amp; digi@@ came ; and D@@ c@@ u came with you three alternatives : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for adap@@ tive homogen@@ e@@ ity Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm for me and that of me used . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue @-@ correction values here . this is certainly the best method for one color correction , since you are done during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates colour information and provides instructions as it should be given back . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ ous ; information how to translate the colour information from a colour space in the other , so that colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior questions when a picture is opened in image processing / color administration module with raw files .
color Profile folder Put here the folder , such as / us@@ r / share / color / ICC / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ plug ; examine these files during the start .
settings of ICC profiles you have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the pipe file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here only your pictures color manages not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera operator and model you are using . not all profiles are contained in the same way . there are some , like Canon , which do not have a color mapping or gene structure . currently , the cra@@ b gamma doesn &apos;t correc@@ ts for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to carry out the dy@@ t@@ apping itself .
there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile which you can em@@ ulate how to print your image from one device again . this is very useful before you can print a smaller colour space than your camera and some colors , therefore you could manually adjust it to the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is fairly obviously what color profile is intended for what is intended for . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official :
the Canon pro@@ filing extension makes the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Ne@@ ut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plug@@ in interface . it is an interface that is supported by a range of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and imaging procedures ; many modules support , which were written to support with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules that you want to use , and they are then loaded by &amp; digi@@ ous ; here you will find some new entries in the menu of the main window and beyond .
Short@@ commands for tasks assigned by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Short@@ cuts .
for more information ( in English ) over K@@ IP@@ I modules you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project via htt@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the Manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adjust@@ s the time between the image passes , normally , 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check@@ boxes switch on the metadata one or from , which are displayed at the bottom end of the pictures during display .
the camera features show on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right hand , there is a camera that is connected to the computer . if you want to use it , you will see that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the picture display mode . currently , there are Ser@@ ielle , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass memory .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage camera . this field is only active when you choose a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera . you must specify here the path , / m@@ nt / Camera or / m@@ nt / you , specify when you mount your camera .
to use &amp; digi@@ ous digital camera , you need to connect and turn the camera to the display mode using your computer .
try out whether &amp; digi@@ came ; the camera will automatically detect your camera . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it will display the window of the main window in the menu . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option Con@@ vers@@ ation dialog for the move of &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ can display , you can set the talk of &amp; digi@@ pack ; when del@@ eting a photos in an album you will find further details on del@@ etion of photos and del@@ eting an album .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be used tac@@ tically through &amp; digi@@ ous ; if you use the option to apply changes to the right side@@ bar without any re@@ questions . otherwise , you have to apply changes to the button changes .
you can also display the display of the &amp; digi@@ ous screen display ; when starting , this will be accelerated under certain circumstances .
the setting at Bei@@ m Start search for new photos &amp; digi@@ plug &amp; digi@@ came ; if something from the base folder was deleted , ask &amp; digi@@ plug , ask , if it should delete it from the database .
several color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ plug , in order to adapt the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool bar . a preview of available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ plug , you will find further information on this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ came ; contains quick picture processing with some basic tools . you can use it to preview and improve your photos . image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the entry and selection of the single entry / editing menu .
the image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ ous ; therefore , some of them are not part of your distribution . for further information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules you will find in the image processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , the file number , and the current image size indicates .
a menu bar on the upper border and among them the tool bar for quick access to the most required functions .
editing functions of image processing change your photos . however , no the functions will change the original photo before you use the Save or the button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can not recover the original photo after you have saved the picture .
so you may need to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can save you with file saving as well .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can re @-@ produce the original image by using the image Edit@@ ing or Rest@@ ore the button Rec@@ over to the tool@@ bar . you will lose any change that you have done at the photo since last store .
almost any action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting the edit and rest@@ oring your editing from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should attach the key@@ hole , C@@ trl ; -@@ z for revers@@ ing and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; on the tool@@ bar a moment longer , you get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions will be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started the image processing , you can move between photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes to the current picture , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can add in the picture and zoom in to you c@@ trl ; click or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the request menu .
to suit a photograph to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . usually , you will come to the normal view where you enter the Es@@ c key . usually , you can change this at the Settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can also modify this in the Settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ ous ; You can view this from the &amp; digi@@ ous window ; see the section for setting up image processing .
if you want to print the actual picture , select the image file and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or entire phr@@ ases . entire image preview can select from your selection . you only need to select the images from your selection and select Export Wizard . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you only need to make your choice .
&amp; digi@@ came ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and promotions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is also available in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked .
multiple Click on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again in the rim .
in the label view you can input or paste lab@@ eling with unlimited size . this text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters you are allowed to be used in EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data so you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data support only ASCII @-@ characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut according to 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC @-@ labelling field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you have commented it , use either the button Apply or change to the next picture , the inscri@@ ptions are then stored .
in addition to the user button there is a button more . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . this will always be done if you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the section review shows the evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . the rating from the side@@ bar is always applied to a picture at the same time , select it and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field directive . encoding follows the schema in the following table :
the keyword shows a search box for fil@@ tering of the keyword , the keyword tree and a selection box with the previously applied in this &amp; digi@@ ous box ; session applied .
the keyword tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the entered keyword . you can limit the number of ways in search of a keyword quickly . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is another relief when typ@@ ing stit@@ ches in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed various keywords , they are stored for the quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the respective check boxes in the tree . all keywords are stored into the keyword in the IP@@ TC field .
if multiple images are selected in the main screen , and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this only applies to the highlighted image , if you want to apply a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter section .
the side@@ bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , data , keyword and search inten@@ tions . if additionally , one or more keyword filter from the right side are used , only the cut quantity of these two will be displayed . all created keyword will be available .
you can also pull and off . suppose you have chosen several images in the main view , you can simply drag it out from the right side@@ bar and place them on the selection . then there &apos;s a dialog that you asks if you wish to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window shows the images on one calendar tag . the keyword filter stands on no keywords that were reduced to three images . they were drawn with Str@@ g + a , and afterwards a keyword out of the right keyword tree has been drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialog is asking whether this keyword will be set .
this search for changes takes place in every start of the program . it can also be switched off under settings .
if you have a rule with and created , and find that it should be one or not , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control range .
( 1 ) : the entry to which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already in the database .
you can define a Extended search on all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , only use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options see as follows :

this article / Tut@@ orial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this job . I mainly bought it on &amp; digi@@ came ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason why one sets a color @-@ managed workflow , which is the colors produced by your camera or scanner , you can reach that the colors on your monitor or scanner can also display them from your camera or scanner which are the colors you want to print or publish in the web from your digital dar@@ k@@ room .
if the theme comes to colour management , you want to know which buttons he wants to press for the results he wants . in addition , you should provide adequate background information about colour management at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , links with deeper information allow you to make your own inform@@ ational decisions that you receive the desired results .
if your image workflow meets all of the six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color administration .
you are working on a monitor which is calibr@@ ated onto the s@@ RGB colour space . ( further information please see below )
your only other picture spending is available by e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life for everyone so simple , why should one use another color space and so that thoughts on color managed to make ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colours we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colors that we can see the hu@@ fe@@ z region , and the colours in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB using some larger colour spaces , please visit Bruce Lind@@ block &apos;s excell@@ ente page and click on info and then on information About RGB Working spaces .
do I have to calibr@@ ate my monitor when I decided to work in a s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB color space or do not , you &apos;ll need to work your monitor as s@@ RGB format . if you are working as a color space of s@@ RGB , you must either use your monitor on s@@ RGB @-@ standard k@@ alli@@ bri@@ eren , a suitable monitor profile or do both .

this tool presents five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before trying to proceed further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , ab@@ ject , autom@@ atical and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ating Automatic correction will automatically try out of your colors the best . they will experiment with these effects to see what works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled down the entire picture , so the dark spot is black and the bri@@ ghtest spot as bright as possible without its color lat@@ ting to change . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed .
off : this method is adjusted to the lumin@@ ous factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity curve is the same number of pixels . sometimes it has a very powerful operation , which causes either wonders in an image , or it destro@@ ys it .
automatic ab@@ al@@ ers : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and the light intensity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the wid@@ est possible range and a re@@ group of all values in between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the Weiß@@ k@@ ale of &amp; digi@@ came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white comparison of a photo .
the Weiß@@ punkt @-@ correction is somewhat limited because you can work with a color space with 8 @-@ bits per color . so if you can perform the white @-@ equal in the raw mode , so that you can perform the white @-@ equal in raw mode , so your possibilities will fail to correct the correction .
this tool is based on a white noise level protected by the copy@@ rights of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it via the menu entry , white @-@ equal to the image processing .
the preview window can be adapted in the size . on the left hand , both the original image can be seen as well as the preview of the tool . if you want to see the original welded structure again , it &apos;s enough to click on the bottom window .
the preview of the target photos provides a red mar@@ ker . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els under this mar@@ ker is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right up , there is shown a hist@@ ogram that will change dynam@@ ically as soon as you have given a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful as you can decide whether one of the three pixels is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ancy .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gamma . the shade adjustment lets you enhance or down the shadow of your photos .
by using the above controls , you should use the colour temperature pip@@ ette . press on this button and then click on the picture preview to select selected color for calcul@@ ating the colour temperature of the white comparison . in this way , also the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white comparison with the list of pre@@ ferences . the following settings are available :
the coating indicator will increase the colours when more than a color channel of the pixels are over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in the white comparison . this is displayed in preview as pure indicator and does not have an effect on the final image .
the buttons save as and store just do this . each adjustment of the white comparison you have set can be stored into a text file and re@@ load later .
the button def@@ aults rever@@ ts all filter values back on its default values and the corresponding neutral white comparison . note that also neutral settings will result in another photo than your original . if you save it , your original image will be changed .
here you can adjust the code depth per colour channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high quality images . however , this coding needs more record field , calcul@@ ating time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and DN@@ G .
this tool opens the same dialog as to the editing of raw images . it uses the change and as@@ signing of color profiles . a detailed guide can be made for the usage of color profiles . detailed instructions for using colour profiles can be drawn to the chapter color administration .
another important tool is to find in the menu under colours sound correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously , so you can also use this for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner will always need the same error and therefore you will always find the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you will find under colours gra@@ dation in the menu .
the digi@@ plug has four color effects , a solar thermal effect , a Vel@@ via filter , an Neon Eff@@ ect and an edge filter available .
in times of the chemical processing , the term of the process was developed , even Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect of the developed pressure of a short flash@@ light and subsequently completed the development of the picture . the result was a partial neg@@ atively of the picture . the result was a partial neg@@ atively of the picture . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
the intensity controls the Solar@@ isation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically feas@@ ible . an additional increase is finally produced by a negative image that is not to produce on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of solar power supply . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation so he does a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . simply try it , he beauti@@ fies many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an un@@ altered rich color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contra@@ sts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for natural photograph@@ ers . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colors are , but also some pictures , especially those who barely distinguish between landscapes .
the Neo @-@ filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on light to the contrast ratio . parameters level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeat the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . in large images , the filter can relie@@ ve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras have often problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual to correct the colour contrast and the lumin@@ osity of your photos with the tools in the menu under colours . once you are satisfied with the results you are using the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo of bad lighting conditions you can get the opposite problem . also in this case , you can reduce the satur@@ ation instead of satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . all the changes you can see in pre@@ viewing . if you like the results you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple leu@@ ch@@ strength / contrast / gamma is the tool a key correction for improving the exposure . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you need only the range of the slide . in concrete the three shooting below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three fir@@ ing are clicked into which to be moved , to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to learn the operation is to move the knob and take care of it as the image changes .
on the right hand , the original and preview of the picture can be seen . the preview is dynamic , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this sel@@ ector can be adjusted , if the hist@@ ogram is displayed using a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y @-@ axis . in pictures the large areas of a constant colour is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic division is more useful .
three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle frequencies , frequently gam@@ ma@@ sts .
the three colour p@@ ushes can be used in preview of the original image , in order to adjust the input values of the shade , medium and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls which can be used to evaluate the output values as well as with the input values , for example , the compression of the output values can be used for example as a background to be seen in the background .
automatically : with this knob the image values are automatically set in dependence on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons the set values in the file system are stored and later loaded again . in addition , the Gimp level format is used .
when you use this mode and the three colour pip@@ ettes , the input files will automatically be adjusted for all shades , means and solar panels . select the colour pip@@ ette that you want to use and click on viewing the original image to set the axis program for red , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ channels .
the Att@@ ach@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to view over@@ exposed pixels and view the combined result of all channels . this means you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you can see an example of the alignment of the input rates applied on the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha Canal , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side the half of the original and the target picture will appear . the preview can dynam@@ ically be updated depending on your settings . the following options are available on the right @-@ hand side :
modi@@ fier channel : this sel@@ ector allows to specify the channel which is altered by the module :
beside this box there are two symbols to switch between linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . in this case , linear mode is the most meaningful one . for pictures with large areas of a constant colour the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode is used .
for example , if you move a short valves to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can look that these bright tones will correspond to a dar@@ ker outfit and the associated image pixels are dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red mark to see . if you want to change this markings on the curve , which is a matching line on the curve , which is the original value . create a point on this line and move it up , until the value is adjusted for your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every curve which you can create can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . the file format is the Gimp short format .
when you use this method and the three color pipe buttons automatically create the control points of the curve , medium and solar panels . activate the color pipe you want to use and click on the original image to set control points for the rotor , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to preview over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel , you &apos;ll get the combined result . this means you will get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ esc@@ ale canal . the colour pip@@ ette has been placed and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and this corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of &amp; digi@@ came ; image processing is a tool to enhance the colour channel or change the color @-@ sh@@ orts of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors Channel Mixer .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint as you can correct the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left corner of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with its own riders .
the preview of the target image has a red mar@@ ker . if you position this in the picture a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
checks for the module are right below : control knob for red , green and construction allow you to quickly change these channels . this is particularly convenient if you tick the respective color components . this is particularly convenient if you can select the color mixer then DAS Tool for creating great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . please try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of color becomes a visible noise , which looks from color @-@ space . if that &apos;s the case you can reduce your Mon@@ och@@ rome conversion as a result in which you can reduce the color of color .
saving as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can be stored for later and then load them . the used file format is the Gimp @-@ mixer format .
the Att@@ ach@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to view over@@ exposed pixels and view the combined result of all channels . this means you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re @-@ reset . the flag can be preserved . the original image is visible under ( 1 ) and the processed picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photograph has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photographs is black / white one step , because color images can easily be converted onto the computer . also with a set of film roller profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / W film exposure with a green l@@ entil filter . this looks good for all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so much like the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ te : sim@@ ulates a black / W film exposure with an orange lin@@ ter filter . this enhances landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) or@@ anger@@ ed .
Rot@@ ix : sim@@ ulates a black / W film exposure with a red line filter . this creates dramatic asc@@ effects and can sim@@ ulate moon light to the time of the day . thus , similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) rot@@ ic filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / W film frame with a yellow line filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) j@@ aun@@ dice .
Sep@@ col@@ on : creates warm bright and medium sounds while he adds a little of cold in the no@@ p@@ ia . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and the recovery in a se@@ p@@ ia . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and with it similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool texture apply , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
by adding a texture to your picture , regardless of whether it &apos;s a color image , or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu entry texture can be used for it .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the semb@@ lan@@ ce of depth and triple @-@ dimensional texture on the image .
a paper of tex@@ tual work has been applied on the picture below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) . the relief is set to 200 .
the digi@@ plug wall came ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of an viewer in the limits of a photo is not a slight task . a possibility of keeping his attention is to make the image an decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the moving eye . under picture frames , the module can be rest@@ art@@ ed from the image processing .
type : with this parameter you set the required design type for your image . surround it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , ring@@ ed it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a push of a button and decorative adds a z@@ ier@@ frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is 1 % to 50 % .
this with the scope of decorated target image will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into a picture of any place . this also passes several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . use the character set , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties like you need . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . already , the picture is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the digi@@ plug &amp; digi@@ plug tu@@ sten@@ cil tools you can apply a template on a picture .
the menu sten@@ cil template uses in the image processing can be used to place templates through a picture .
for the template there is no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . you need to use the P@@ NG file format and you should add to the maximum compression of the file size ; if you want to add a template to &amp; digi@@ ous sten@@ cil , please send an e @-@ mail in english to the &amp; digi@@ plug ; mailing list digi@@ came @-@ user @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your templates with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied templates . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder is set for templates , a tree view appears , which reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cils . the selection of a folder will update the templates automatically .
among the pre@@ viewing are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this knob increases the displayed picture . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
resi@@ ding : this knob sc@@ ates the underlying image below . it is cent@@ ered around the position of mouse . if you want to apply the template onto the whole picture , please check the image correspon@@ d@@ ingly . please check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the picture lying under the template . take the picture and place it in the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply template to your image . the image is then adapted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ came ; provides three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but produces especially in dark areas , gra@@ ined pictures .
the sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharp@@ ly . actually , it does not work to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
focus is perhaps the best of the three , as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjusting .
photos without focus and most digital pictures require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is where sharp edges can be summar@@ ized as a colour . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras do normally need more retro@@ actively counter@@ acts as normal cameras for private users .
with JPEG image , a camera has had applied internal sharp@@ ness . images in the shell format must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed in during processing .
some scanners turn a hot air already while reading the image . if you disable this , you get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing value . this allows you to exit with the menu entry .
but you should use carefully , since the results do not work very naturally : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , you can focus on the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ating Re@@ focus . you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw a bit soft to shar@@ pen@@ ed . use the tool to sof@@ ten with the menu entry and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ shar@@ per mask is a very good tool for removing veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview help you to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should first try out . if you make the sharp@@ ness mask too strong , noise and impression of gr@@ ats will produce in the proximity of sharp edges .
the radius is a how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter . high resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , they should be sharp@@ est pictures of the best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the recorded picture which is added to the original . thereby , the thickness of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the swelling is a breach of the maximum RGB value and the use of the difference . this way you can use a minimum difference to prevent a can@@ opy of filters . in this way , areas with a soft change between the sounds from shar@@ pen@@ ing off and therefore disease errors are avoided in faces , hi@@ des and water surfaces .
this is an example of un@@ sharp@@ ly mas@@ ked filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp@@ ly mas@@ ked was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0 .
the digi@@ came ; tool Re@@ foc@@ sciss@@ ors focus on a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ er@@ quot ; in which the de@@ focus is used . this is better to use a technique called F@@ IR Wiener fil@@ tering . the traditional technology used to shar@@ pen images is the use of a sharp@@ ness mask . you can start it from the menu by pressing colors re@@ foc@@ als in image processing .
in practice , the circular blo@@ c works much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung has a very long tail , which is far from the original bou@@ levard , which is far from the original qu@@ ills of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s fl@@ ushing is affected in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels .
spher@@ ical sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should be good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very un@@ sharp@@ ly but on Hei@@ ligen@@ sch@@ eine .
correlation : the correlation of correlation can help to reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation is reduced to the sharp@@ est effect of module .
noise filter : an increase in the room filter can help you reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0.1 . however , values are higher than 0.1 . however , values are very poor . a useful value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value is not getting dirty .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your un@@ sharp@@ ness is used . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the r@@ ushing filter .
Mat@@ ri@@ zen@@ man : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results especially if you choose large values for the circular shar@@ pen@@ ing or the g@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
saving as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any interface parameters which you have set will be saved for later and then be loaded .
try to perform all the cutting , colour and intensity colors on the image before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes are not immediately visible , which left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts later .
to read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp@@ ly produces better results than sharp@@ ness . this could cause the un@@ sharp@@ ly mas@@ king a bigger neighborhood used as shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically , inev@@ it@@ ably , inev@@ it@@ ably create ar@@ te@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ess filter . basically , the result of the F@@ IR Wiener filter is always at least as good as the un@@ sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Wiener Filter is often better when processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small , focused image :
the original resulting color image has to be corrected . this image has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is attri@@ but@@ able to in@@ sufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for further information on the shar@@ pen@@ ing structure in digital images , you can consult a technical comparison in English under this address .
the knob smoo@@ th@@ ed the sharp@@ ness of the range of the dar@@ kened , to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the color tin@@ te allows a customized color for the pupils . if you want blue eyes rather than dark , you can set it here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools in order to remove the arti@@ facts with an un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented speed .
the in@@ ert algorithm was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains several pre@@ ferences as Star@@ points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you wish to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail post@@ ure p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a small value leads to an even smoo@@ thing over the image . the value of 0,@@ 9 should preserve more homogen@@ ous regions of smooth and details . a value of 0.9 should not be subsequently necessary . please note that the detail in detail should always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated to the accuracy of accuracy .
accuracy @-@ dependent alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ ths evenly throughout the directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film bearing or CCD noise , a high value of waves can produce similar pattern . JPEG Arte@@ facts will be picked up at a value near 1 .
smooth finish &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all es@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , set this value matching the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it becomes difficult , as it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; tur@@ mo@@ ist effect , it needs to be set higher than 3 .
repeat : specifies how often the algorithm is gone through . usually , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
el@@ bows &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is chosen , it should also be selected small . note that small angles are to be selected a long runtime . you should choose this value as much as possible and un@@ acceptable for your needs .
integrated stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated stri@@ de length in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel pitch , and never greater than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more of quality you get by selecting this option is low . however , it doubles the runtime . we therefore recommend it to it .
the buttons save as and store just do this . every setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and be loaded again later .
image error correction is compar@@ atively fast at work . however , it can last very long and still take a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button departure .
below you can see how image errors are taken with minor arti@@ facts . the module is taken on a picture taken in Guatemala City with a analogue camera . as you see , there is a unique black arti@@ fact in the foreground to see through a bad film location during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) and this corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the digi@@ plug is a very powerful tool to reduce the noise . it uses an un@@ protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tool is available for selectable viewing angles , to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screenshot above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise which can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you will only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings menu can remain in default settings .
radius controlled the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filter is required per pixel and can make the image affected by the radius and the color in it is smoo@@ th@@ ed and therefore smaller faul@@ ts .
sharp@@ ness : determines the sharp@@ ness underneath the filter distance the filter looks forward to see light turns . if it is increased you will need to adjust the edges of the filter . if the value is too high , adap@@ tive filter details can no longer receive and noise , or lubric@@ ate it again .
edges : monitors the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong can &apos;t appear the whole worm or boot@@ leg , put it on a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that controls the details dialog .
color : controls color tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that controls the details dialog .
gamma : control the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ anz of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker parts , which typically are stronger than the shadow zones .
shock absorption : determines the alignment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ ic shock absorption . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius is respon@@ ding to the edges . if it is increased , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter may appear on the edges . it can remove noise points and is the recommended method for it .
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters of the pre@@ condition that you have set can be saved in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how space reducing your life can change . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected word ( 2 ) . the pre@@ condition is used with standard settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , this solution is to shar@@ pen a bit soft and experiment with the menu entry to shar@@ pen and experiment with the glasses . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to reduce photo ar@@ te@@ facts .
this filter for rest@@ oring gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very good adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s smo@@ ked , scrat@@ ches , compression ar@@ te@@ facts and local errors that make the content of the image con@@ tours and thereby receives the content as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for colour and tex@@ turing . the texture rendering is done with another tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ kre@@ i and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Arte@@ facts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ sy compression g@@ lass@@ ot ; - small standards that are shown in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons save as and store just do this . every setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file later and loaded again later .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively fast at work . however , it can last very long and still take a high CPU load . you can therefore inter@@ rupt the calculation at any time using the button .
below you can reduce your photo with equ@@ alis@@ ing noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera onto a Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film bearing on the faces . the original image is visible under ( 1 ) and this corrected ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures reduced to an old colour photo taken with a scanner . you can see the scan ar@@ te@@ facts that were caused by sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the photo paper . the original image is visible under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&amp; digi@@ plug &amp; digi@@ plug ) captures hot@@ pixels of photos that were taken with a CCD camera . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project protected by copyright Martin Dick@@ ass .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem associated with high quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression by a built @-@ in re@@ pression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; light pixel quot ; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the button dark . the tool will automatically recognise the hot and bright pixels . these will be highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can connect the dark picture directly to a new hot or light pixel by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark picture to the correct image . note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the latest dark image and re@@ charges it automatically in the next session .
the image area and preview can help you correct the outcome . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all areas of sight .
select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ation : an average of the neighboring board is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ec@@ tives in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for horizontal and vertical line .
lin@@ early : all pixels that have a distance of 1 of the pixel block are moved to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a gap of 2 or less to the pixel block are pulled to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a gap of 3 or less are moved to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ ter correction on a color photo , from a broken digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long expos@@ ures . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and this corrected image is visible under ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ plug is provided ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool for the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. exposed corners , to correct an image .
wide angle lens , especially those in the medium and large photo format , frequently illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( shaded ) they will reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light the sensor there . Tel@@ e@@ objects also show this behavior .
but it also has draw@@ backs . many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should also use the center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise un@@ intended effects are caused by movement .
with the large expos@@ ing areas of today &apos;s fil@@ ament and the pain@@ t- or grey @-@ gra@@ fts from digital cameras and film scanners , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a c@@ enter@@ filter that is used without these filters . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies to a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of beam d@@ amping at the point of the largest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , elimin@@ ating an optical filter with a lens adjustment of 2 , or acci@@ dentally offset the density to compens@@ ate a bigger degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate a little degree .
Leu@@ ch@@ strength , contrast and gamma @-@ settings : the editing of an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the layer thickness of the pixels . you must adjust the expos@@ ing of the target image with these options , as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fine re @-@ adjustment of exposure of the target image , so leave the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero , and use the gra@@ dation of the &amp; digi@@ plug function ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the correct picture in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a layer of a layer and contra@@ ction structure was also performed with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ plug is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses in photos . it uses a copyright algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geometric dist@@ or@@ tions . colour dist@@ or@@ tions can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric dist@@ ortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ vex shape of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s off the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth engraving correc@@ ts the removed corners to the second degree . when you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical dist@@ ortion is almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the thickness of dist@@ ortion @-@ second Gra@@ des . with negative values , tons of glob@@ ular dist@@ or@@ tions can be corrected and positive values con@@ scienti@@ ous dist@@ ortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of dist@@ ortion . this value affects more strongly than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner Parameter has the reverse order of the parameter tab .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus leads the correction to the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image increases .
bright : this value adjust@@ s the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview of dist@@ ortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used for the next start as standard values .
the tons or con@@ scienti@@ ous correction should be carried out before all cutting or size changes . in the best result , do this correction as all of them . if you have a new picture of the picture , the effect of the effect would be apparent .
to help you find the best correction for you to view this tool a vertical and horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . in the connection you can correct the tons / cap inter@@ lock with the help of the lines .
if you adjust a con@@ scienti@@ ous dist@@ ortion , the resulting image will have black edges . you can edit them with the cutting tool in the menu editing or using the zoom knob of this dialog .
for most images the tons @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some motives like photos from the front , frame and paintings are the perspective so to correct this when you keep the camera with the hand you will always have a slight dist@@ ortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the tons @-@ shaped correction to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of Gimp &apos;s mobile devices which can be reached under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this movie has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red right angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview , you can adjust two parameters set of film bearing and film sensitivity to you if you want to sim@@ ulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO knob changes the amount of film bearing and domin@@ ance of green green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter channel mi@@ xes to re@@ produce inf@@ ra film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter applied mainly to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the image has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights .
the digi@@ plug section is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool for re@@ produce film bearing on your images , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers great p@@ em@@ ulsion by the manufacturer .
the film body effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets rid of daily lives . in case you want this special , gallery @-@ like , road photographic , cor@@ pus sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ ms photos , so you have to use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the default value is , although frequently higher values are needed , if you need more grains , so you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film adaptation to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the used movie sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the oil painting came ; filter oil paintings created the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ plug &amp; digi@@ plug filters make your digital pictures a nice look like oil painting . natural pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two controllers to influence this effect . the top cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five out . th@@ icker brushes are better suited for large images . smooth , smooth or , viewed from the other side , the smoo@@ th@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the working is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smoo@@ th@@ te 17 .
the digi@@ plug &amp; filter used ; filter charcoal drawing uses colour and intensity gra@@ dient to produce an carbon@@ ic acid . therefore , images of whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you choose which scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch . this would be good pictures to start .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob cho@@ oses the pin size and the lower adjust@@ s the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the coal label filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter engraving is shaped your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it was used by copyright protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter engraving is a fast tool for converting your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where colour is not the most important at the content . the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ tory landscape .
the depth allows to set the contrast of fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by dist@@ ortion @-@ effects . it is used by copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and lets it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the wavelength 1 , the image is dist@@ orted with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can stop these effects at any time using the button .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of acu@@ ity effects . it uses protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom in sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ping the image along stone @-@ shaped lines starting from a center . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in the sport photography .
radi@@ ale un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing : wi@@ ping the image by turning the pixel to a center . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a turning camera .
distance sharp@@ ness : get the image to produce the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lenses . the object seems to be back in the background .
movement of motion : get the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a linear movement , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera .
soft@@ ness : make the image soft into the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or add a warm and subtle glow .
Schüt@@ ting : bl@@ ends the image by random post@@ pon@@ ing of the pixels and thus sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a completely moving camera .
intelligent in@@ acu@@ ity : find the colour b@@ ins in the image and get it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the picture in rectangular cells and then created it by col@@ t with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the button .
shel@@ ters are a nice small tool to make re@@ ent@@ rop@@ ing on your image . this gives it natural your images a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected by copyright .
the drop size allows the size of the drop to change . since the drop @-@ size is not altered automatically with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce size for small images . number changes the number and the density of the drop . fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drop@@ let on the image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also have a section free from shelves . to do this , please use a range of tools in order to select the area , e.g. a face which will remain free . if you start checking the filter , the area will remain free from shel@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the rainy filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a peaceful sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or turning to the right orientation . you will find tools in the menu , turning la@@ under@@ ing or create mirrors .
photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to increase a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture of shr@@ inking is easy . the big question is , how can you zoom in and out the details ? how can you invent the missing information ? how can you invent the missing information ? how can you see the missing information again ? how can you see the missing data ? try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select the size of change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is below to see .
the tool to size is using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the infl@@ atable .
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ came ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool like you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New size and are listed below :
if this setting is enabled , the new size is retained in the original size of the original size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it becomes difficult , as it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; tur@@ mo@@ ist effect , it needs to be set higher than 3 .
the buttons save as and load are used exactly to this . each setting for photo can be saved as text file and re@@ loaded again later .
photo infl@@ atable is very quick at what it does , but it can still last very long and take a high CPU load . you can stop the calculation at any time using the button .
you can see below an example of the photo above , by increasing a little color image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication .
the cutting of a photo is not only a commonly performed surgery , but also a common under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . to cut a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pull the rect@@ angle , then you &apos;ll see this rect@@ angle in while you move the mouse .
if you release the mouse button again the area of the photos is cut out . this will make a good overview of your photo after cutting , by pulling at the corners of the rect@@ angle , simply create a new rect@@ angle with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button &quot; button &quot; button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo will be cut properly ( C@@ trl + + X ) . to store the entries and save file under the menu , in order to save the newly added photo .
in the viewing area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you have defined in the dialog .
in the tool Fol@@ lowing aspect ratio you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or landscape . in the high format , the larger value of the height and in the scale format is assigned .
the tool Fol@@ ding aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means it is always the same whether you can use cen@@ timet@@ res , inch or any other physical size . for example , you can see a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist to automatically center a horizontal or vertical .
in the dialog box , you can set the max . ratio button to set the area to the maximum possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool appears according to the aspect ratio ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as standard values in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the EX@@ IF data and not the original image .
the help of alignment aid allows you to bl@@ end help , so that you merge your images better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmonious particles are based on the principle of re@@ semb@@ lan@@ ce . as the third party ails , harmon@@ ic triangles are possible to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles in the diagonal .
golden center : the golden center is a division which covers various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Naut@@ il@@ us mus@@ sel or the flower leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things we feel beautiful .
the golden pitch is the ir@@ ration@@ ale number 1.@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used by ancient Egyptians and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you sum@@ med up your images , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divider is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that this rule will follow as a visual harmon@@ ic .
the golden center provides smoo@@ ther relief lines when you put together a picture . these help are listed below :
golden Spir@@ al will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third party the golden Spir@@ al creates a liquid line of the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the look of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
another rule is the rect@@ angle of the golden Spir@@ al , also known as gold rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rect@@ angle is used to produce the golden spiral . this can be a line its or different objects . this can be one line his or without the eye , it &apos;s going to fulfill its task .
the Golden triangles are also sli@@ pped from the top discussed golden Spir@@ als . on the side , these ver@@ tices are the center points of the golden rect@@ angle . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are no equivalent to place . diagonal to position these lines can be place more dynamic .
when you use golden triangles to place your frame , you will create a effect of place by professional photograph@@ ers dynamic symmet@@ ry . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach any other .
the options Horizont@@ al mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic divisions .
using the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of lines to your current image .
the Free rotation is a tool for turning a picture to any angle .
if you make a photo , then it happens easily to fix the camera or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things are turned around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ ous rotation . simply select rotation and adjust the rotation angle of rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this slide are stated in degrees . by default , you can reset the sli@@ der again to 0 degree . a preview of rotation is displayed on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be shown in the upper right .
at your help , the module offers horizontal and vertical line at your disposal . move the cursor in the picture preview to position the two lines . once you have moved him over an important point of the image you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now , adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted dirty holes in the corners . one way to repair this is the function transformation into use from the image processing .
an elegant way to crop the image is Automatic crop . choose one of the options below :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing to@@ ken the image a bit after rotation . however , note the above warning .
all output transform@@ ations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is displayed in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
in order to change the perspective , you need to re @-@ use the red squares at the corners of your image . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information which help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including empty areas that were created by transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including empty areas that were created by transformation , in pixels .
angle left at the top : shows the current angle in degrees along the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle left at the top : shows the current angle in degrees along the upper right corner of the transformed surface .
angle left at the bottom : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed countryside .
after adjusting the perspective , the image gets somewhat dirty . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adap@@ t@@ ations create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective , you get un@@ pleasant dirty holes at the corners . a way to clean it is the image with transformation cut from the image processing .
the sound tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is no rotation , the image is dist@@ orted to the right and lower part to the left . with other words , a rect@@ angle is transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
she@@ er your image by using the Horizont@@ al angle and vertical angles . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the thumb@@ nail .
to your help a vertical and horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the check@@ box to adjust your image .
after you have done the calibration , the image will wi@@ pe a bit . for a single shift this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two shots are generated twice as much of the wounded and therefore you should avoid this .
after the etching , the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to eliminate these is the image with cutting cutting from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ came ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the type like this libraries comp@@ art@@ ed . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to process a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ plug .
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on its system , but you will always find JPEG and TIFF below .
&amp; digi@@ came ; shows only files in formats to the same . this happens according to the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can modify this list of file extensions published by &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can change this list of file extensions ; please refer to the configuration section .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to find the most used format . a more detailed description of these file formats could be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression processes on digital images . redundant information is reduced to this way to save the image data to an efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results as JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also store los@@ s@@ less when this is specified in the settings .
in case you want to learn more about the raw aspect ratio , so you can read from Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour . you can convert rough files to JPEG or TIFF with the Roh@@ ing@@ kon@@ verter of &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can find more information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ plug .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; also supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is contained in &amp; digi@@ ous formats . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that came from &amp; digi@@ plug ; supported :
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often stored in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . therefore , these formats and therefore are not compatible for films . if you click on a movie file , &amp; digi@@ plug ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback of movies use to play the program to play .

if you swap the steps 4 and 5 , which you can do well if the initial contrast was very good , then you can perform the first four alignment with the module white .
many tools you need for image processing are included in &amp; digi@@ ous ; included . your description will follow here .
all picture processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft@@ ness , noise reduction , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp@@ ly mask , &amp; etc ; use a uniform dialogue that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the actual picture . below you see &amp; quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar indicates the status of the filter on the current image . on the left of it five buttons allow the compar@@ ative mode of the demonstration . these modes are :
vertically split without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied on the right of the selected thumb@@ nail .
horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected fo@@ undry .
vertically left . the left area shows the original and the right to comparison the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the upper part shows the original and lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; style : displays the preview when mouse is not in the screen and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can switch on to show over@@ - and exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse inside the picture and place it on the part of the picture you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noted .
the page bar features the essential information on the selected image and is largely in@@ explic@@ able . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters while shooting the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data , if they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ tool . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to drag and move it . all images within this coordinates are filtered and displayed . this process of course requires your pictures Geo @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for p@@ all@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to elect colors .
the Pal@@ etten files containing from &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or just one user . in the latter case you are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot custom color and Zul@@ u used colors .
in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of the installed pallet and browse the folder according to files .
the cursor is displayed in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color . colour is described under the pallet view . here , the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor there . afterwards , move the mouse when pressed left mouse button .
if the check box is inserted under the button color , the color will be inserted from the color plate at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes a different ; depending on whether the mode has been selected , you can adjust the cursor over the cursor under the cursor .
a selection which is produced as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copying , slic@@ ing and inser@@ ting .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; used the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name , if another color follows . if there are three numerical values in the clip@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ;
colors in the palette and the colors of the color palette can be drawn with the mouse .
select a color anywhere on the screen and then you will find in the shade on the left .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ ically ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . these programs are used in science , especially in the computer science , especially in the computer &apos;s software . previously , there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; Project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs by a modern , user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ ically ; -@@ dot ; the &amp; graph@@ ically ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; Kate ; graph@@ it calcul@@ ates and representing the graph in &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; Kate ; open the graph in &amp; graph@@ s ; open in a &amp; Kate ; component
loading large graphics ( currently there are problems with about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than these knots )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that requires the &amp; graph@@ ically ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for presentation of the graph . needed in detail :
the main window shows the opened graphics , each in a separate window . at first , if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; without an argument , the tool@@ bar will only open the file symbol and the ( empty ) list of last open files . click on the first icon to view the dialog .
after having selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window will look like in the lower screenshot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this list using the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse ( high and down without special keys , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
zoom in both directions is limited by a factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file is currently in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; loaded file from another program is displayed , the following window will appear :
you can choose whether the graph will be re@@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change , if you want to change the change , you may later change your decision later . if you decide to change your decision later , please use the menu item settings .
if you open a graph archive outside a current &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; file opening , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; or specify the instance at a sub @-@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change this with the setup dialog .
when starting the program , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice both and later .
you can also set how the graph will be split to multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
if you are using multiple pages , you can select whether the parts of the graph , which are to be entered into one page . if you retain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled from the respective parts of the graph .
preview with one page displayed on several pages with no head@@ line and with a different font
the page again gives the ability to specify the behavior when a file is changed on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can re@@ load a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or update the program every time .
the page opening gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; graphic viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside the current session . you can specify a default behavior for this case ( can open the graph in a new window or in a window of the already running session ) or determine that every time it is asked .
the seat management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; specify a default behavior ( open the files at the last session or do not ) , or determine when start@@ up .
the context menu , usually with a click in the main window with the &amp; RM@@ B@@ n ; appears , opens additional possibilities :
here you can choose among various &amp; graph@@ ically ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ algorithm , the standard for coated graphics . he produces hier@@ arch@@ ical or lay@@ ered images of directed graph@@ s . the algorithm domin@@ ates the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and possible few cant@@ ons .
&amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ coated graphics . he produces represent@@ ations according to the jump spring model . thereby , the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm created for un@@ coated graphics a jump spring model layout . it uses the Fru@@ eh@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istik , and includes a multi @-@ s@@ litter for the treatment of large and clu@@ ster@@ ed graph@@ s .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm calcul@@ ates the no@@ des circular in accordance with the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese in 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multi @-@ cycli@@ c structures .
open a dialog in which you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should give the graphic command to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can use &amp; eg ; to modify the &amp; graph@@ s ; or modify the graph with a filter , before it is drawn .

the K@@ IP@@ I module images make tools available to capture new images and save these images .
this module can be used to capture and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : using the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner which is supported by the san@@ e project or any other source such as video streams . so , you must have K@@ oo@@ ka and san@@ e installed .
if you can scan the menu entry images , a dialog that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears that you can replace the default value duc@@ tors to select your image accordingly . the estimated file size will be displayed in the lower , lower corner . the estimated file size will be displayed in the lower , lower corner .
note that the window will be fully displayed , since some settings might not be displayed .
after pressing the button scanning , you must wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image appears . here , you can select the compression and type of the image file . you will also need to select or create very large files . you must also choose the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image files .
from screen shots you can generate after you have selected in the menu of Imp@@ or@@ tier@@ a- &gt; screen shot ... a window appears in which you can adjust the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop individually , to insert a single window under the mouse .
when selecting your own program window , the calling program will disappear so that you can view other screens and windows . otherwise , you will read , after a brief delay , read the currently visible workplace . if you read the complete desktop , only the window is read under the mouse .
the delay is intended for a long screen shot , before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ spaces , you should select this delay high enough to navigate the time to navigate .
after the screenshot of the screenshot comes the dialog Options of the target picture with the options described above .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows it to add and process GPS coordinates into the images of an image . the ge@@ ographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF data and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images of geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordin@@ ate system , which is used by GPS and Galileo , to locate . height , long@@ itude and lat@@ itud@@ inal degrees are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with ge@@ ographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in the GP@@ X format . G@@ PS@@ Babel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . to run a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you must download a file file with GP@@ X file , of course , data taken at the same time at the same places as the images of your camera .
when the file is loaded an automatic correlation which shows the coordinates in red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ dates are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera @-@ time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . this will be done with the time zone .
the adjustment for maximum time vari@@ ance indicates a upper devi@@ ation for the GPS @-@ time and camera @-@ time . if the devi@@ ation from among them is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have any track data from a location for pictures you can edit the GP@@ X file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have a suitable data . if you know that in reality a location in a great time difference between camera and GPS is , you can place it here and then make the button cor@@ related .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have a set of photos on the same place . as the coordinates change to the next place you just have to use the button OK to put the data in the current picture .
the location can also be found with the displayed map and be placed . select the relevant region and enlarge it . the amount must always be selected manually . the card can always be selected manually . the card can always be selected manually from the card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside of the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are options to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ if@@ tool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Collection Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for HTML pages . the character set will be encoded with UTF @-@ 8 encoding .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be customized . the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . with the three buttons on the right hand you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below is shown the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that will appear in the head of the HTML page .
the rider App@@ ear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely in@@ explic@@ able . the option for each image is created itself . if you click on a picture a new page is shown in the picture , otherwise the image will be shown directly with your standard screen , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed .
the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated images . choose a folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything there will be created there .
if you chose the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures will also be stored in the new images .
with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . it also affects the file size . all other settings are explic@@ able .
the rider screen@@ shots allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album riders for the thumb@@ nails which are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user as far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore see if errors appear during the generation . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press Close to connect the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations like spins , zo@@ oming or shifts . the viewer can be used with short commands and folders . it has been designed for fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start a picture is shown as default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG los@@ s@@ less module is a tool to change images without aff@@ ecting your quality .
this module allows to store images in JPEG format , without storing the usual losses on quality and metadata .
the consequence of the los@@ s@@ less storage is the size of the file size , since there is no compression of the color information . this can be found e.g. at P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ d. please Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Metad@@ ata Editor currently has no documentation . if you wish to change this situation please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from a picture to another . then choose the image file dialog with which you want to copy the target picture , so the image to which you want to copy the metadata . the data will be copied after that you have pushed the button OK .
this function does not work in all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please refer to ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected pictures into a MPEG @-@ video , with a defined length to convert . this module uses the packages of M@@ jp@@ eg@@ tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add a base image to the slideshow . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow .
all images are automatically synchron@@ ized to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can choose a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . finally , you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the pictures that are packed into the MPEG slide show . then you can launch the module about ex@@ tras easily .
the images selected by you are then monitored under picture files in the Portfolio , where you can also change the images or content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your listing , you should select the video format from various formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and VCD . PAL is pre@@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds which will display a picture . a low value generates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in case you should leave them black . the name and path of the generated file can be set to you under the name of the MPEG output file . if possible , please keep the extension mp@@ g if possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , then you can start the production of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can now enjoy the generation of your computer . depending on the speed of your computer you can now enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow , if you are back .
if a note appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages to adjust the settings right below .
the printer driver allows to print multiple images on one sheet of paper along in standard Photo@@ sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp . this is for example : useful to improve or using the Gimp module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in the RA@@ W format in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . a original format from Him is : don &apos;t expect it from d@@ cra@@ b to make the same results as the software from your camera player . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ b better results ! .
first , select the RA@@ W file that will be converted and launch the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window appears in mode for a single image . with the button Pre@@ view you can view the effect of your current settings .
now you can adjust the values to optimi@@ zing the conversion process . the first option decides to adjust the camera values for the white @-@ equal . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later .
a four @-@ color R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are happy with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the tagged image format , TIFF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
in case you often have to edit your images or later , you should not use the JPEG format , as it allows only a limited number of operations before the image quality deteri@@ or@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG format , the metadata that contain in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF file .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start converting the conversion process . if you want to break down this process , you can inter@@ rupt it .
the pile @-@ processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , for example , by testing on a single picture , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . here , however , you have the possibility to automatically over@@ write files . this is helpful if it has been created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview can be seen on how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the time@@ stamp .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can add or enlarge the image size from the image change :
proportional ( 1 den@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the image will be selected automatically , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 den@@ im . ) : resi@@ zing change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adapt your image to the screen format .
not proportional : no proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
print preparation : prepare the image for the photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target picture , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected pictures using your preferred email program . it is also possible to preview the size of the larger images in advance . you can also drag and store other images on the list of images .
after you have launched the module , the pictures window will display the images you want . with a file selection dialog you can add more pictures . for the last selected image you will see a preview on the right .
you can also draw pictures on the picture list and to add them to the list of images added to you .
with the knob pictures you will remove the selected pictures from the list of larger images .
after you have selected all pictures you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you will only need to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures selected by you are already attached as attachment .
do not mind too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations regarding the size of the E @-@ mails . there is possibly a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and any time used until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field .
if you are using the Google Mail service you have to install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer before . you can download it here .
after the selection of comments in a suspended file the comments added to the pictures added to a text file .
P@@ NG format under the menu image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the los@@ s@@ less formats , such as TIFF . therefore , you should therefore use P@@ NG , if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be modified . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG image files and the original files in JPEG format , then the original version data will be added to the previous images .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed so you can view the status messages when searching for errors . your e @-@ mail program will automatically end up at the end . with the button closing , you can shut down this window ? EN .
after starting the Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au module , a window with issues such as you wish to have shown your slideshow . you can choose between you selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL passes in the presentation use very elegant image files using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card , because otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the option fil@@ en@@ ames indicates that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images in the left corner will be shown during the presentation .
this option loop makes it possible for your presentation in an infinite loop . you can manually start it with Es@@ c .
the option images are randomly chosen , that the pictures are displayed in random sequence . so the order of the pictures will not be used in the album .
in delay between pictures can be set the temp@@ oral distance between the individual pictures . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . you should test this from your computer and the chosen transition effect . you should test this before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen trans@@ itional effects between which you can choose . randomly chosen every transition between images and another effect .
during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left side of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn off .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show .
on the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; Date is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ d. please Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the work surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the sub@@ menu option , as background for your K@@ DE work surface .
once you have signed your pictures and videos with notes , you can go with &amp; photo album ; by these brow@@ sen , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , so in persons , places and in group keywords are present .
in the browser window you can see the categories you have entered when you have entered the images and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look at the EX@@ IF data , viewing the folder structure on your hard disk and naturally see the actual viewing images .
when you press the mouse to the entry , the browser &apos;s view changes . see picture .
if you select another person only the images are displayed on which both individuals can be seen . by this selection method , you can restri@@ ct the number of images displayed on a few thousand images onto a few individual pictures .
if you have selected all the persons , locations and other settings , you can view images to view the images of your device .
in the picture each person has the same icon in front of its name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own painting , which is of course also for locations , keywords and other categories you have defined . see the picture .
to preview images next to the name , select the button , which is to the right outside on the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu you can select the view that you can display for example icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords can display ( if you have no suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
however , you must select the image files for each individual person to display the image files . here you can select the image editor ( in closer ) and select the image files for the respective person . in the request window you can select the magni@@ fication factor according to your desires and select which part of the picture should be shown or cut off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you search the entry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the main window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for the set of image properties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can view this dialog again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you type a string into the lab@@ eling or description , you can also enter the description and descriptions of the images according to this text , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all pictures by certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; a photo album ; if you do not like to read manu@@ als , but rather like to try features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage from &amp; to photo@@ album ; and take a look at the high speed , the screen photos and introduction videos .
launch &amp; photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog box , if you start &amp; get a photo album ; start the first time , or select the menu entry into a photo album ; -@@ Demo video files and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try it out .
if you prefer to print this manual , please refer to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a linked HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; a photo album ; see the time bar . a picture of this strip you see here : as the name already says , this strip shows you data statistics on the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several units of time . each strip displays a different unit . you can change between units plus , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you see a part of a database by showing the body only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used in the following ways : you can change the displayed items preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the time line will always show you the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button pressed and drag the mouse over the ruler of the time line , thus the time information will appear to you in the preview view only images of this period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the time bar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; photo album Book ; introduces you two ways to create HTML websites with your images . one is integrated into &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as a module ( see ) . in the following part of the user book , the following is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version described in the menu HTML ... call .
before HTML pages you need to make some settings , these are divided into three areas of content , layout and target . in the following , every area is described more closely .
first you enter the title of the review and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on a photo album ; HTML sample pages look for an example of this settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; next , select whether a &amp; photo album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ Export Project &quot; &quot; &quot; ; -@@ Export File is to be seen on the reviews page . se@@ w informations about the export @-@ files you will find in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lastly , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to see that all images from a party are obvious . for example , all pictures from a party are . for example , you can &apos;t use this setting . currently , you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain pictures from certain consider@@ ations .
in this area , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clear , which is why they are not received .
below the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures . therefore , those who have viewing your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800x600 , no more pictures download , for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the be@@ holder of your site can change the resolution at any time , so he can search your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if it wants to appear a larger image he changes to higher resolution .
in this setting area you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
best , select a base folder for all of your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for any subsequent set .
first , you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be stored and automatically select for all future images . here you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if they are all displayed for the viewer . if you select for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created , this folder should be displayed here . otherwise , the web browser should start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files have not yet been created in the final destination folder , you must manually copy it to the final destination of the file . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the options described here are based on bas@@ folders or URLs . in this , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you specify in output folders .
if you are looking for a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can , of course , take a lot of time to view the images on images , capture , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . these can be combined with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in that the images are stored in the file or if there is only one link to the file in the file that you have all pictures contained in the file . the obvious draw@@ back is the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File Station ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that you have given in the .@@ k@@ im file . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML @-@ Export menu .
in the following , the dialog for export images is described , which you can export via the Export menu ... call .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available to you :
to manually copy the Manu@@ ally to the .@@ k@@ im file , you will need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automatic to copy the Automatic to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; drop your photo album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . as most pictures already have been compressed using JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , if you want to comp@@ ress this too , just select the export file .
the last option of this page is maximum size limit . if you want to send your friends pictures , you would like to send the pictures in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can say that each picture should be at the maximum 800 pixel wide and wide .
if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file import@@ ing ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the assistant to Import has four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , after , in which folders they should be copied .
it may be that you are named the category people of the implic@@ ated file that means ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is called for your database . therefore , you will be imported into the third dialog box which are to be imported into your database and what Categories are listed in your database .
in the fourth step you can remove the categories of the present file with the categories of your current database . an example for this is shown on the image .
it must be easy to browse and watch images : if you look at pictures , you would often like to see images within various picture groups and see a picture with your friend , perhaps you would like to see all images on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual you will learn the various steps from ( 1 ) Set the information about your images , via ( 2 ) the brows@@ ing and watching , through ( 3 ) advanced issues and adap@@ t@@ ations .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it was expanded and today also takes care of your videos . many places in this manual will talk about images , but often these videos are often conclu@@ sive as well .
&amp; photo graphics album ; saves all of its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the upper@@ most folder of your pictures . here is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice , e.g. Normal backup tools , to back on a disk@@ ette or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want .
&amp; photo graphics album ; re@@ members the folder where your images are stored and used for future Star@@ ts . if you want to read a different folder in &amp; photo albums , you can start page -@@ c . as an example : photo album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
above the menu entry menu theme photo album ; set up to a window , with which you can change the settings of your photo album ; in the following section of the user book you will discuss the various settings .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can preview the settings and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call on the F1 key and click on the desired option .
in it you describe what you can define for each picture of different properties , e.g. persons , places and tags . you can also create your own groups , such as objects , animals or albums .
on the dialog box which is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group you can select an inscription and a symbol .
in the section Sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set up complete list of members , i.e. all members of one group at once in a group instead of all groups of a group as stated .
in view of the list of settings you can choose to set up the member groups . with the select list box you can choose the category you want to configure . in the left window of the page you find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; photo graphics album ; shares its modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ plug and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plug@@ in Interface . se@@ w information on this page you find on the K@@ ip@@ i homepage .
the modules can be called via the module . the modules can and are not described in this manual , as they are not sold separately . however , most modules have a help page which you can call on the module yourself .
since the modules can be used together from multiple applications together , you can test new modules first with the demo database . therefore , you should ever test new modules with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . don &apos;t say , I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , so that it can be some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not functioning . this is the down@@ side if you share functions with various applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are simply using a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order is not supported , it sim@@ ulates the order for some modules , so that you can use the features with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
the current album , this sim@@ ulates the current album , so all images that show you the picture preview is now displayed .
next to the current album I have to book a photo album ; the modules also displays a list of albums . here are the photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , e.g. all persons , then every entry in this category is an album for the module .
or it will be the category which you have specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums , so if you are using the category people , so whether you choose people to view the view and share this .
since some modules are equipped with a photo album ; not compatible you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog , and select modules which are to be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen when you start &amp; get a photo album ; start your own pictures .
as you are familiar with any other K@@ DE application , look at the top of a menu and a tool bar . at the moment , you will not have a lot of information , since you don &apos;t yet have any information about your imag@@ ery . in the section , we will display on this window , now you can click on the entry images that shows you an overview with all existing pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any picture with notes , where the image has been recorded , so you can set any picture individually or for a larger number of images . if for example on all images Jes@@ per is pictured and all pictures in Copenhagen have been recorded .
all these notes can be used for searching and Brow@@ se as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
in seeing three lists with a text box by setting up persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea lies the shift of images within the list . if you have a family celebration , and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people can be m@@ apped , so you can move the names used up , which can be found faster and assign them .
if you prefer to appear a alphabetical list , click on the icon for sort by date under the list .
if you have selected notes for each image , you may wish to edit all the selected pictures and add them . click in this case simply click on the front and back buttons that are located below the preview of the picture on the right .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and add the menu item several entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as a group . to show you , a special symbol is displayed .
in context menu of the Association dial@@ ogs it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also submit an entry to this entry in order to sort this sub@@ category this entry . watch out that you can sort your categories alpha@@ be@@ tically .
you can move the individual elements of the configuration dialog by moving the l@@ aces , which form the top of the frame , click and move your own window by moving it outside the window zone .
if you have adjusted the look of the window so adapted to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... which offers you the opportunity to save the current structure and look of the window .
you can also display a frame even fully . if you want to see this window later again , use the button options ... and click here window to show up . this process is shown in the picture .
if you select the entry images in your browser , you will receive an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or all images in case you do not have a filter here . for example , you can view the size of the thumb@@ nails by simply drag the mouse with the middle button of mouse , configure . just try it .
if you make an image on the background of your desktop , this picture will be set as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this is displayed in the picture viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can also delete pictures in the image preview . simply select the respective images you want and select either the Remove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button or select Edit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit menu &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; now you will see the window that you can see in the picture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; photo graphics album ; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use the images anywhere , without having saved on the hard disk . you must , of course , be able to store the images anywhere , so you can see the pictures from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures from the hard disk can be loaded .
images of which the upper right corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard drive . for example , the thumb@@ nails are present in the pictures 1 @-@ 9 . for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 you can view the thumb@@ nails ; however , you can view these pictures with the image viewer .
as you see , this function is required to copy files from the folders and copy it again . if you don &apos;t want to avoid the inser@@ ting of the CD@@ ROM , please buy a bigger hard drive to store all pictures on it .
in the menu you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to add a little more privacy , you can filter the images that you want to see for others and click on the current view . alternatively , you can also check all images that your small sister may check , control and select the menu entry all except the current view .
with this you have set what images are to be hidden in the case of your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , which allows you to get blocked . if you want to see the pictures you want to see , click Lock .
it is also possible to specify a password , which must be entered to unlock the images . to set this password , simply select your password in the menu of privacy .
please remember that this image protection is not very secure . at one you can read or delete all images on your hard drive , or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text , only those who are familiar to the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml ; those that are familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to have a look at private pictures .
the reason why you want to spend all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ album ; of course , and hours over hours to describe it , of course , that you want to look at them sometime . this is why you have a picture _ and video viewer . this allows you to preview , as described in .
the viewer you can see in . it shows of course the picture , but additional information you can enter on the picture , like e.g. who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ Box is based on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can just pull it out and elsewhere . all these options are displayed on the viewer . all these options are displayed on the viewer . all these options are displayed below .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here to click here . if you click here to click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you chose people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene selected .
in case you have loaded several pictures of the viewer , you can switch between them and jump by using the buttons picture and jump down . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also available from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer you can run it as a slide show , then you can launch a new picture after a few seconds . as often , a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and Plus or minus . the slide is stopped by pressing C@@ trl ; S .
a very useful ability to look at &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it used in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you can use the viewer you can zoom into the image and zoom out . with the mouse , you can easily pull a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button you can zoom in to the middle of the image . shows how a zoom @-@ angle is marked and shows the result of zo@@ oming .
with the dot button you can reset your zoom , which the image is not drawn up , so that the image matches the zo@@ oming , so that each pixel is on the screen of a pixel image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work with videos that are in the inside and out with the plus and drop @-@ down .
with the script functions from the context menu you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can make remarks about the actual picture with the menu item comments from the context menu .
if you look at images , you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can open the view and configuration dialog of the picture to mark this name . but maybe we &apos;ll pull only the picture to mark and see further images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures on a printer to see the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you see one after another .
for the two examples above the be@@ holder gives you the opportunity to see pictures with features , while you are viewing them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature so that you are using the corresponding characters . in view , see a picture which features A , B and C features .
once you have set features on your images , you can see them in your browser . so , if you have selected all the images you can edit , print or whatever selected , so you can use one module to copy the selected images onto a CD , or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can display in the preview pane . if you display categories in D@@ re Vor@@ thumb@@ view , then you can press features to the images by pressing the characters for the feature after the picture was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you will allow you to paint your photo album ; on the image .
the most common is not stored with the image , but in the database . on the way you can und@@ o your old later .
in case you can see a picture on the painting window . to turn on the painting from &amp; to@@ photo@@ album ; click on the image to finish the mouse . just click the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you must not completely rule the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; but you should not have read and understand the documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , as all objects are already selected using the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the location where you want to insert the object and either select the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed , so that you can choose the right position :
with del@@ etion either from the menu bar , or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed features , click Apply to Apply these changes . if you have invalid values , a message will be displayed using an error description . then you can click on the input errors and click on users or reject the changes .
when you type the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution please download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or texture part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the landscape view .
press the option to preview the properties side and a small example of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture . if you want to have selected the entire texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross locally .
screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag this control points with the mouse button , thereby changing the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points and it displays a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by pulling the mouse inside the window .
each object has as a wire model . you can specify this value relatively to the level of the over@@ arch@@ ed object or as an absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected or their visibility level smaller or equal to the scene chosen in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window structure as the default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the Standard Window System or if you need any other arrangement , you can easily save them . you can also store multiple window orders and easily switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or under any side view , pull the beginner to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle indicates the new position .
in order to create a new column , you pull the beginner to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then ancho@@ red at the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to review multiple views , pull the beginner in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map tab@@ s up in the views .
the last possible window response are suspended opinions , opinions that are not ancho@@ red in the main window . to view a view from the anchor , drag the base on the desktop or click the little arrow pointing left in the side@@ bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the starting bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the menu view you will find entries for any type of views . new views are suspended , you can anchor them at any location .
the current window view can store you with view window response ... save it . it will display a dialog in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program has to be installed properly . when this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 actually . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click on the symbol Ren@@ dering the symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry scene .
a R@@ ender mode is equivalent to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . he determines the image size and quality of the rendering . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can freely insert many different slides , from a quick preview of up to full @-@ quality images .
if you click on the The R@@ ender - in the tool@@ bar or in the View menu view mode , the following dialog is opened :
each player mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is useful to recognize the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the donated images . if you want to render only a small area of the image , choose the check box bottom and enter the image section to the rendering in the input fields .
in combination quality you can select the properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for rendering , this is from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in user manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
if a picture is ri@@ ver@@ ted with only one ray per pixel , these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è sample or stepped effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally look better with this feature .
when you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive , because each pixel is further divided and adap@@ tive , because each pixel is further divided and adap@@ tive by the calculated colour values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a beam . if the difference between the colour values for the adjacent pixels is t@@ apping the given threshold of 4 , then a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated using a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , the pixel will be followed by 4 sub @-@ pixels which are individually followed and further for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the records can be adjusted using the depth value .
another way of reducing the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch J@@ itter@@ ing , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it means very long to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this map card you can adjust whether the alpha channels are calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have no object .
opens a new window for viewing the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; select the scene file , select the menu entry ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; yet not the full command set of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if import@@ ing error messages or al@@ erts , a dialog window lists a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import and write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ end .
you can extract objects from the object tree in the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray . this adds to the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor . just select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can also insert the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene is ren@@ ounced . usually , this is PO@@ V@@ RAY or x @-@ PO@@ V@@ RAY .
if you click on Help in the Own view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User Doc@@ umentation for the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example elev@@ ation data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; when you enter files , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first connected file will be used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for viewing in the camera view and in the window type identi@@ fier .
you can set the points of object on the grid in context menu of the wire model views . you can set the ring separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and turns .
larger values result in an accurate wire model and thus a better way for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects like e.g. the ball you can set the detailed stage for two directions separately .
if you cross the high detailed map for advanced projec@@ tions , all wire @-@ track views are further sub@@ divided , if the camera are using an extended projection . advanced projec@@ tions are all projec@@ tions with exceptions of the perspective and the vertical projec@@ tions . this property gives a better approach to projec@@ tions , but requires more time to render .
when you tick the wall , a wall is scra@@ pped behind the objects . the wall is displayed in two adjustable colours .
when you cross ground , a floor underneath the objects is rendered . the floor is displayed in two adjustable colours .
if you tick ch@@ urch@@ ase , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be adjusted . more precise information about parameters can be found in section R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section window orders shall be explained how to create and save window orders .
the drop @-@ down window classification : shows all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen windows of the program at the start of the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . you can add a new arrangement using the button and remove a selected arrangement using the button .
each window structure is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name displays all views for the selected window directions . new views can add and delete selected views using the button .
the position of the new window . with new column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ ancho@@ red the window under the existing window , with map card , you can &apos;t get a map view in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to begin with no more accurate knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should make the ultimate but very popular scene under beginners : a ball on a plane .
but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings , before you notice only a black screen . if you are using a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set any camera , no rules for rendering should be applied , as a result , you get a black image .
if you have no light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you &apos;ll get only a black image .
if you have installed all error free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window rules :
take a little time to know the menus and the existing icons of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , giving you an appropriate performance of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols of the same application as well .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . then select the scene and then select the menu entry . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wireless model view shows how the camera looked at the whole scene , which you can generate . in particular , this is the view of the scene from the camera &apos;s view@@ point . this shows you the scene of the scene .
the object tree has a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you can see the content of the object properties , in which the different parameters of the camera are found . in the user documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , please see further details .
do not change anything about the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but note that the camera in the view control points you can change with the left mouse button on a control point and draw it to the desired place .
when you press the button Apply or the input button , the wire @-@ size views and the object tree immediately change these settings . as a result , you see here the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could adjust for example a Qu@@ ader ( inser@@ tion body Qu@@ ader ) and size at x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 but this is a frag@@ ile method for solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite level as a base :
a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and press the button Apply or the integration . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view also shows the plane , even at the moment only a limited fin@@ ite layer . if you render the scene , the level extends to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree accurately , you will notice the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , turn rotation and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the stress line , just to get some of these parameters . choose a shift and set the values as follows :
first choose the floor to hire its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something depending on the moment .
in both cases , a dialog where you can select how the object is to be inserted . the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . you can preview the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button to look how the pigment looks now .
of course shows the preview of pig@@ ments only a matt black material because you have to set the settings for the pigment . here you can always think the colors of materials at any time with a click on pre@@ viewing . also , there are many options , but take the easiest way .
if you don &apos;t want to preview color on qu@@ ads and ball , click on the button Apply and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is right now set . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color . you &apos;ll need to enter two new attributes here . in the color list you have to do two new attributes twice . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this also more frequently , but the chess board color column can only be used with two colors ) :
choose in the object sag@@ ique every time and change colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already work out this step , as you have understood the basics of working of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should have understood the ball as simple as the ground :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the button or the button Apply button ) , so the ball will float above the ground because you moved the floor around one unit down .
of course , the rendering now makes a strange result : as seen before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , set a suitable material .
when you chose the ball , you can now assign a material to it . like already at the bottom , enter the ball a pigment as colour :
select Pre@@ par@@ se Ob@@ jects and change the name for example in Sphere Pig@@ ment . click on ball Pig@@ ment , then select inser@@ ts and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
change the values as in the following screen photos and click on users or press the input button .
the settings shine effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : still not selected :
you should now have a good impression of which possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers . hopefully you have lear@@ nt so much lear@@ nt that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is an easy @-@ to @-@ use method to create a two @-@ dimensional photo of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera , which reflects scenes ) through any pixel in the scene and how atmospheric effects will work like fog . so the scene is processed for pixels .
as you can imagine you won &apos;t see any camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you see nothing , the picture is simple black . apparently , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
you can select your file in the usual file dialog . PO@@ V@@ RAY files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens up a file . you can select a file in the default file dialog , which you have made with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaced the oldest entry in the list .
if you already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space .
rest@@ ores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage has been saved .
this menu entry can only select if you still have not stored changes in the scene .
repeat the last updated command . you can only select this menu entry , if you use editing .
stores the current window structure and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or re@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the appearance , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog for changing the keyboard short@@ cut . you can modify or add commands to this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; commands or adding new commands .
opens up a dialog to create the tool bar . you can add and remove commands with this option tool@@ symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to pre@@ dict rough surfaces without changing any b@@ ump on the surface and without changing the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file both for a b@@ ump @-@ map as well as for a texture map .
basic body are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens of or even hundreds of these objects . these models will then continue to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base , by using an image file as a color map .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display with clicking on the &amp; LM@@ B@@ n ; or key Return key .
you can adjust whether any image will be shown in a separate window , or if all pictures always use the same window .
if you are searching for a specific file , simply type the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field is found in the lower right corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame appears , the file will be highlighted by pushing up Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in dialog box - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five learning flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can adjust the working mode of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the two others , Short@@ cuts for the display window and Short@@ cuts for the browser , can set the short@@ cut for the windows .
if this is selected , the images are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display surface is filled with the background color that you can continue further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is activated , downloads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already see the next picture in the folder while you still see the actual picture . this reduces the delay when you select the next picture , and is especially suitable for a slideshow .
this option stores &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when moving the last open folder . next to Start &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click the colored bar to select a background color . it is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the picture , also here the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; enabling you to view only some of the file types that can also display the program .
with this option the display window is displayed on the full screen . this option is enabled by default .

&amp; show@@ y ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developer will help each other . if you want to answer a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; you can then ask you questions to other users of &amp; show@@ room ; however , we hope you will soon answer any questions of other users . in this mailing list , however , you should definitely be powerful .
the best start to join in &amp; show@@ room ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list . instructions for joining the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ room ; .
&amp; show@@ room ; tries to give you so much control over its work processes as possible . there are many options to change the behavior of the show@@ room , you need to set up in the menu setup photo ; you can switch between these settings by pressing on the icons of the left side .
in the field of exposure inde@@ xes you can select the color that is displayed if the under@@ - or over@@ exposure @-@ indicated indi@@ k@@ ator is chosen . it should display the colors with what you should display , in contrast . exposure of colour should display a dark colour and exposure of dark colour .
the main window of &amp; show@@ piece ; has a side bar on the right edge , which provides you important information and actions to the selected pictures . you can also find this page bar in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images , which no longer power to scan and save images .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an easy application to scan images and save images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can store a dialog for saving and save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display images before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner on the san@@ e project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ lev@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .p@@ l .
a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in terminal . if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog to select the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . break off , stop &amp; end .
other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options .
to insert a picture , the user can start a pre @-@ speed and then scan the scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the Pre@@ view button .
to select the image better , the user can zoom out into the image and zo@@ oming out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom , so that the complete preview can fit in the window .
if the picture was selected , the final picture can be read with the scan button .
if before saving a preview display is selected in the settings , the image will be shown in a preview window , as shown below , then the picture is stored and Sch@@ lie ? EN leads to a departure and you will return to the main window .
by using the Settings menu , the nam@@ es@@ ake dialog will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
users can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must display a preview before saving a preview . if such a preview of the user is not desired , the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the way as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images can select . dialog to store for each image opens the dialog in front of any scanned picture . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , you must save it automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the pictures are saved without asking for an file name . if the pictures are stored after each scan , this folder will be used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this by using the button ....
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is furthermore the proposed name for the image in the dialog to store . the automatically stored picture gets numbered if a picture is stored . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to store . this value also changes the compression value when choosing . if select the image quality , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button On starts the K@@ DE about dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the knob adjust@@ s the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to stop &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ;

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other programs keyboard short@@ cut . below you can set up a list of this symbol and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cut can set up , by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select Glob@@ ale button dressing ( select the right mouse button in the Player window and select Short@@ cuts ... ) .
you can probably set up existing multimedia keys so that it work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ sh@@ commands . this will make you your keyboard at &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that can be found mostly in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ CO@@ P functionality of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists browsers and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ CO@@ P function blu@@ ep@@ rint could look &amp; b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; also Amar@@ ok has some specific command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all the necessary modules are available and use dialog for the user to know why a script does not run .
Beg@@ in the &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE binding for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ binding V@@ 3.4 is RE@@ QU@@ IRE@@ D for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit exit
in the scripts / template you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply complete the required functions . you will soon find that writing of scripts relatively simple .
using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can be exchanged with Amar@@ o@@ ok and using Amar@@ o@@ ok . the sim@@ pl@@ est way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should accompany all K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the run of external programs and commands . in this way , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; send messages to all ongoing scripts . this is why they should monitor their default input scripts and respond according to events . of course , a script should also ignore their default events if there is no use of it .
configure We@@ ar the script to display the setup dialog . to store the store data , every script must take care of . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work@@ load into the folder , where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script might now be &amp; c@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions further information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume signal to change the volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ iz@@ able Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu em@@ em@@ Tit@@ le created the path to the selected files in the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu entry can also be used to select the script to remove d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu pop@@ ok ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ends ; or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to execute , for example , saving data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which may optionally also be compressed using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally be retri@@ eved using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ tar ) .@@ mp@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 , so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept the script packages with the expansion amar@@ ca script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining load load should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and hang the link to the wi@@ ki script page from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features , but is surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; you can simply drag and drop the playlist using endless menu . maybe you can also find only a certain title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s Collec@@ ting browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then if the decision is still hard for you , choose the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically choose the right music for certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used to listen to the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right thing to re@@ discover your music !
typically you need to enter and install Amar@@ ok sources in the base folder of Amar@@ ok sources :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and automatic use , you should have no difficulty when you compile problems . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; as most of the uses , has several options to enable or disable the compile time@@ point using the configure script . this is a list of available options .
certain depen@@ dencies have to be met for some of the comp@@ iling options , so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements section .
activ@@ ating de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you wish to help using &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without trouble on the setup dialog . the setup dialog has multiple maps for setting up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
player window displays the player window in addition to the playlist , or off . if the option is disabled , only the play@@ lists will be displayed .
note : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this option switches the experimental function of the mood .
in atmospheric : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this creates the color scheme for the mood of the mood .
file files are stored in the music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , .@@ mood files are stored on the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; normally ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should start when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
playlist by moving , saves the current playlist automatically while preparing &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . check this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the playlist when moving .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : if you tick this setting , use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of the music files is stored .
actual piece of action can be seen visible , that the playlist window opens / off to keep the current piece always in the visible window range .
when changing the context @-@ browser , automatically switch to the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the App@@ ear@@ ance section you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is part of three parts .
in the Fon@@ ts section you can use the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; otherwise select the fonts for the following area : playlist window , player window and context @-@ browser . if you select ... , then you can select a font from the selection dialog .
with the choice of custom color scheme you have the source of choice and can define your own color scheme . to do so , use the activated color selection for the front and background color .
play at the start continues , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after starting the program , playback will automatically continue with the piece on the spot , with which it has been stopped at the last finish .
the sub @-@ screen on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display , you will preview the O@@ SD and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first option is to select the font . click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to select the font for the O@@ SD . the check @-@ box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ ady in the O@@ SD . &quot; &quot; &quot;
own colors apply to you the opportunity to match the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on the color surfaces opens the dialog to color choices . if your own colors are not activated , the default &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used .
the input field display text provides the text displayed in the O@@ SD . through the input of wild@@ card the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of the available space holder and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen a multi @-@ monitor environment will display the O@@ SD .
the Audio output audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop down box . some drivers are able to activate additional possibilities in this map .
the map collection will be used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folders and type of database for collection .
here you can select the folder , select &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box beside its name . this section also includes boxes for setting up , as with the selected folders .
browse other sub@@ folders : this causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folder will be searched for music .
monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) , in addition , an incre@@ mental search takes place in order to make the necessary changes to your collection .
lists play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found lists in your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will be added later in the play@@ lists browser .
part of the Collec@@ ting database is used to select a database for the collection . the Combin@@ ation Field Driver : lets you select between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , additional device in the window of MySQL is necessary .
the MySQL configuration section will be used to set the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on which the MySQL database is entered , where the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is made .
use user name : and password : to enter the data you need to connect to the database .
the card last@@ .@@ f@@ m is aimed at the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and when needed add music @-@ recommendations on demand .
here you enter your username and password for your load .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register any on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m Website .
sending off pieces and update so the profile : this setting allows you &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar to vo@@ iced : after activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar inter@@ ventions turned to the played piece . note : you do not need to use a .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of functions and gallery with screen shots .
Amar@@ o@@ ok needs only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs so you need some of them to find e.g. Mod@@ ules or scripts ) . we have written a small tutorial on how to minim@@ ize k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as O@@ SD is pres@@ umed that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org , for example , we try to make amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they are ready to use an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will bring a mistake in the Tag@@ li@@ b library for days . you can find the file fin@@ d@@ ently by using in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / apps / Amar@@ ok / apps / Amar@@ an@@ .@@ log . then you can also delete the deleted file that crash@@ es the crash . then you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly this is the thing that Tag@@ li@@ bit@@ map contains while reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file crashing . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you are using MySQL as a database , just try SQ@@ Lite . the support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is something mature .
make sure all of you are compiled by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same compiler version . if such as &amp; Amar@@ ok , but with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x was compiled , then leads to Ab@@ le to edit the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use art@@ s@@ d if you use art@@ s@@ d then disable it if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or do not use at least a value of 1 second .
you can also send us back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will automatically open to a crash ) . if it is a common crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as UTF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ info , but do not sign it as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / us@@ r / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; errors while writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; v@@ 2@@ tag , set _ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ ad . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ ad
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols are always active in the status bar ( random mode / restart / Dynamic playlist ) in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is sometimes a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this can be seen in the control center under visual symbols . note that in some cases you can click on a symbol , until this setting shows its effect .
if you receive this error : amar@@ an error : amar@@ an app : unknown icon : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map . please check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ an app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you might need to remove any col@@ li@@ ar Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf such that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems clari@@ fy on the easiest way by using an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for any other users or for developers . use the Forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ sch@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please use only one error , if something is located on the correction of a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist appears . how do songs come in there now ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the launch window has been converted into the statist@@ ic window . you will find it under ex@@ tras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for the evaluation by the user , while the points are automatically calculated .
to rate the pieces , you must display in the playlist document , and select column review . click anywhere in the new application column , to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the Short@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ o@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select playlist from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with your mouse to the playlist and let them fall there , just as you would do it with other files . that &apos;s how simple it is : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , directly next to the Add @-@ button , the button can be stored . click on it .
probably the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config is probably missing . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look after lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) , and also find it via the menu bar under ex@@ tras .
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; it must be used by a backup independent approach , therefore the real question must be which media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support even text and P@@ NG !

if you use the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must be used to provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and be simultaneously connected to the d@@ mix module ( e.g. S@@ B@@ live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . please consult the D@@ mix for AL@@ SA .
the output of this command should help you in search for the problem of problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you might need to specify another sink ( e.g. a sink ) .
that &apos;s done &amp; Amar@@ ok , already . do not forget that media must first be de@@ coded . you can only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file only if you want to use one or with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file , de@@ code it and send the PCM data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can equi@@ p directly to AL@@ SA , as well as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of the Arts . open control center sound &amp; multimedia sound system . select Sound@@ server with the highest possible priority ( warning , see next point of FAQ ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :

either you do not use the Arts drivers , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts drivers . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was optimized for analy@@ zers ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . yes , this is a bug , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crash@@ es &amp; Amar@@ ok ; why ?
after the installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . perform register @-@ register to record all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask at the IR@@ C Channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( exit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg files , compile and install it as your normal user . then delete the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ p files ( you will find the module folder with drag @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . open &amp; Amar@@ ok .

thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and leave with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be awak@@ ened from the soft sounds of the music that you have stopped before bed@@ time .
how to find the current name at &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles if you are on another computer ?
if a working SSH environment exists , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you Inter@@ pre@@ t and Tit@@ le of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA @-@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user your@@ name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Play@@ ing

opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them will be described about what is it ? -@@ help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful to record files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful for you to use files for a multi @-@ seat CD . it &apos;s useful for you to see the files that are already existing in the medium , so that you can see the files existing already existing files and folders .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function is set up &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . all other files are missing in the project . this function removes no files from the medium , they only bl@@ ends the previously imported files .
opens the CD copying dialog . this also allows copying a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also make a copy of a CD which you can burn then later . also , you should also prefer to copy issues when you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copying dialog . this also allows you to burn a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also burn a copy of a DVD to another medium . in addition , you can also burn a copy of a DVD with the help of copying them . furthermore , the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medi@@ ums in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW disk . thus , you can delete the whole content or parts of a CD @-@ RW disk .
opens the dialog to the form@@ atting of a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , making the content completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes and incre@@ ment@@ ing .
burn a previously produced CD @-@ image . the dialog box asks you to burn after an * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data which is then currently not supported by pressing the burning button . ( N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so you will need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously generated DVD image . the dialog box asks you to use an * .@@ iso file as a source of data which can be burned immediately after pressing the burning button .
a previously read DVD @-@ Video can be converted . this dialog appears usually after reading a DVD in the contents view , but can also be used as well . it contains information about the read video , coding settings , and even options for changing the size and for cutting black edges .
displays information about the requested medium . this information is displayed in the table view and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
displays a list of the tool@@ bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small strip at the bottom of the window is displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if that is not checked , the stat@@ us@@ bar is hidden .
the folder view includes a list of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is activated , their content is displayed in the table view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and locking of the drive or failure of the medium .
on the contents view a or off . the content view allows selecting and drag files into the projec@@ tors . the content view is also the interface to read audi@@ o- or video CDs , if a drive with an appropriate CD / DVD is selected in the folder view .
on the head view is a narrow range , which is only visible , is a narrow area that contains only visible projects . the head strip has no real function , it looks only nicely and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog box to modify the keyboard arrangements for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after you have selected one of the commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard layout down below .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; set @-@ up assist@@ ants . thus , the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator at the start of the wiz@@ ard ( root ) .
the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b will open . here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions by &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should be used to person@@ alize and for the fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled using a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you can use either the d@@ co@@ p command line program , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functional range , therefore rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial to which of the bit@@ ing programs you specify .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . in order to take advantage of the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you must first ensure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , which have all &amp; k@@ de ; program painted , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two additional parts described below .
the Standard D@@ CO@@ P interface between &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; offers functions such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other features for creating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ V@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ V@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ V@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ V@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ V@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ V@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ V@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ V@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ V@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ V@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ V@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ V@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ V@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ .com ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ V@@ ine ( ) void copy@@ C@@ d ( ) void copy@@ C@@ d ( ) void , D@@ v@@ d ( ) void , D@@ v@@ d ( ) void , D@@ v@@ d ( ) void .
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one receives a D@@ CO@@ P reference on the newly created project : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project via # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference , it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above @-@ listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ interface , which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :

this allows you to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders , and add files to the new folder :

&amp; k@@ audio files ; is an audio CD ; CD @-@ reader for &amp; k@@ de ; can be read with it simply audio CD ; s read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the machine .
&amp; k@@ audio files ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in WAV files on hard disk ) and supported by many enco@@ ders , which are currently supported for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) . other enco@@ ders can still be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the tracks of the &amp; CD are read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step such wav files ( usually one per title ) comp@@ resses in the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or even in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cd ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this has not yet been installed , this must now be done .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ suggest ( for OGG ) or other enco@@ ders already exist , so it is probably not necessary to compile anything yourself . however , if FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is not required .
which coding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer is a small introduction to Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and comp@@ elling factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already mentioned , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ dy ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; it &apos;s not possible to avoid any copy of copying them . in any case it is possible to avoid &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Disk ; it is not possible to avoid the copying of copying audio CDs ; it simply avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once must be done ( the setup dialog , but can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily use of a user interface will lead to the comprehen@@ sion of the slim approach of the user interface that will stum@@ ble across the very beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
may &amp; CD ; get information from Free@@ D@@ b from the Internet , or works without a network , whereby everything is detected manually .
this is just a short list of commands of the main window . on the side by step , further information , such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program &apos;s configuration .
if the CD@@ DB will release your CD data in the CD@@ DB tab , which can be installed locally or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be made . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; start reading and - when an encoder has been configured in the tab card settings in the set @-@ up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; encoding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available encoder , so that the selection with an other encoder can be read as the standard . it is too aware that the Encoder has been configured in the tab settings dialog in the Settings dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already chosen file will be selected instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to specify the type of messages ( such as protocols , pie@@ pe@@ as ) for program events ( as read out the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main set dialog by &amp; k@@ audio files ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as Encoder , to set the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , coding and compression rati@@ os and helps you with choosing the right code .
if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also others such as &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information by data compression according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG can today have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit rate the differences become less important because both co@@ di@@ ers produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ n &apos;t that &apos; free , but still delivered with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rate ) , but compared to OGG easily deeper quality with deeper Bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from one computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG devices is present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning 2009 - these tools mostly support the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rati@@ os for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting provides good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting is usually offered for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires ever 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex songs of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR , joint stereo , compression rate approx . 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music by you@@ ths , portable devices and car studio plants . but not good enough for better hi@@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments if you want absolutely su@@ preme quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information , which is manually entered or fet@@ ched by the program from Free@@ D@@ b , are available in the program as a list of parameters . they can be delivered / used with &amp; k@@ audio files ; and the code name for creating the folder and file name as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with coding programs there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; tracks to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3s are encoded with l@@ ame , the switches must be added by l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audio files ; the result looks like this : &apos; -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ds ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
this is what the Free@@ D@@ b is : a free database , in which persons can read / enter the audio CDs instead of being able to download it by yourself in the calcul@@ ator . it is to note that here only the text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal but I ( note of the author ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent the information from the &amp; CD ; however , the information without the artist nor the music business can be added to the music business . all information can be obtained anyway with a bum@@ ble@@ bee by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtu@@ ell .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ .net ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of Free@@ D@@ b can not be used with another ( f@@ ake ) address when retri@@ ev@@ ing the data from the server ( but it can only know the programmer that has checked the code . )
there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Disk ; for using Free@@ D@@ b , the ge@@ ographic is to be used on the next mirror server . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between computers .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ w@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online check @-@ up and CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD . alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which e@@ cho@@ ing program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that it will be used to treat cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; if you want to read more precisely in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed first if this has not yet happened .
to store the read WAV files , the enco@@ ders and therefore select the desired file format . during the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) are displayed on the tab for setting up the code . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the required Linux distribution before the co@@ ders may be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined co@@ ders . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a code reader , further information about his switches can be obtained through the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed factor .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive system , the write and reading files of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) . try to susp@@ end both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could indicate what is wrong .
check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check out the case of the CD . this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with one step for example . even if you are using other settings , this can give tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still un@@ certain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example and you will get enough information to set up those areas to make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will restart the program for the first time and read our first &amp; CD . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sample .
it must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . for example , it can be found as non @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files that you can always do .
please ensure that the directory / us@@ r / share / cd contains and that you have write permission to have this ( eg ; you attempt to copy it to the counter @-@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers basic setting up &amp; k@@ audio files ; something that is likely to be done once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what to be repeated for each read &amp; CD .
here we determine the commonly used co@@ di@@ ers for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program to use the Free@@ D@@ b to download the &amp; CD and download data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them on any reading &amp; CD , if the matching settings are found .
the job title is delivered to the le@@ aching program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
frequently / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link based on the real device number of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can also be used with existing entries of the device drawings for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map card General Settings . here there is no much to do . here an additional conversion will be defined . in our example , everything is shown and typ@@ ed as shown in the screenshot .
please , select only for incomplete information , so you will be informed when data are missing to the sample of stit@@ ching ( tags ) .
the CD / Settings card ; simply select both entries . we are convenient and leave the &amp; CD to download the Internet from a Free@@ D@@ b computer .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD on the Internet to access the Free@@ D@@ b server .
the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD entry is found , if you are later un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag messages , they can easily changed with kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; reverse and the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , please note : if you want to manually enter the drop @-@ in mode , if you want to download the database before . however , this is worth to use Free@@ D@@ b locally . however , this will be used twice . to use Free@@ D@@ b in the open mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first one . this mode is set up on the following map card .
CD@@ DB is for us Free@@ D@@ b . these are settings for the data en@@ quiry for calling the &amp; CD ; information from Free@@ D@@ b server on the Internet . how does the system tell which data the CD is to be received ? read the section on Free@@ D@@ b . put everything as shown in the screenshot .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look after a mirror server in your area . on this way the load is distributed between the computers . however , this setting will work as first attempt .
both work equal to the server , as though many fire@@ walls are bo@@ oting the protocol 88@@ 80 according to the protocol , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to transmit any &amp; CD data to the Free@@ D@@ b server . the first check box should be sufficient .
simply take over the settings of your screen shot . ( make sure the folder / t@@ mp is on your computer )
number of simultaneously lo@@ oting pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? rip reading and code ? the author does not know , therefore simply try it yourself .
CD ; e@@ ject the last piece : cross this around the &amp; CD ; throw at the end of the process .
custom folders for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be saved to the path / folders in which the WAV files must be saved . if only space is done on a other drive , the files will not be stored in the private folder , if you want to make something yourself with WAV files .
all of that type as it is on the screenshot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances a thing must be chi@@ pped to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage usage .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of tags on version 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be deleted also in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screenshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously encoded WAV files : if a Du@@ al@@ Core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to code more than one WAV file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic set of &amp; k@@ audio files ; this configuration is used as standard for any reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section is described , as is the process of reading the &amp; CD ; we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the type like the music on the hard disk , is described in the previous section , since we are convenient and the &amp; CD is described in this section , must be repeated for each read &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD which is not included in Free@@ D@@ b , you will see a little different from Free@@ D@@ b . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD from Free@@ D@@ b , you will learn how to retrieve the data manually from Free@@ D@@ b . comments will be displayed manually from the Internet . comments are drawn to the differences .
don &apos;t try to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this has not yet happened , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screenshot . this only if the &amp; CD can be identified as audio CD ; and it could be read from cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , search in the questions and answers following the help or go back to the previous section concerning basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD was picked up and fet@@ ched from Free@@ D@@ b , all titles are already filled in and furthermore the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; gives a window appears , and you can select the database entry that &apos;s your opinion best to your &amp; CD .
if you do not select the check box for the automatic query from Free@@ D@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for Settings ) , if you do not have a local database , but take the data from the Internet , you need access to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - input of CD data and title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Update &apos; title &apos; , the remainder of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist does not have to be entered in the input field &apos; actu@@ ator title &apos; unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lower comment field can be used for individual comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The comment field of the album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attention : after the successful recall of the data from the Free@@ D@@ b , the CD editor is not blank , but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor ( e.g. if all words begin with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment area . if you are using ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have set an unlimited field length . this option is set up on the tab card settings . to do this , take a look at the section &apos; Basic Settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see for help to receive more information .
simply select an entry , which is obviously not related to the style of the read CD ; for example , this is not important because we will not transmit the &amp; CD . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are under sk@@ irt .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the CD Edit@@ ors window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece . simply type the entries for the boxes of the actual piece . the titles of the piece are displayed in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and put the same way until you &apos;ve entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
caution : this window doesn &apos;t appear if you have downloaded the data from the Free@@ D@@ b . it is already sorted in one of these categories of database .
it is the third button of the tool bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the list .
note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles which are selected so are selected . a simple click on the line switches on the selection of the piece or then press the button all pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at one time .
when clicking on the button select select the read process , this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what runs out .
click on the tab orders to turn on to the window window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the commis@@ sions . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message you see if you are trying to work with a co@@ er you still have not installed . pieces which have not been successfully encoded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folders are not what we have entered here . have you checked if you have writing access to the folders for temporary files and target folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error has occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this will start reading and coding parallel . note the status review in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has found no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior , the number of parallel processes to read and code . with powerful machines , the result is un@@ clear . the used computer with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous interpre@@ ting and coding ( of course two different tracks ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queu@@ e of the body . after the last piece is coded , a small window will be displayed in the top left of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio files ; , you will need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x / 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the encoding of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audio files ; will maintain today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CVS as part of the iconic box p@@ act . if you &apos;re familiar with CVS , you can already download an anonymous copy of it . most distri@@ butions include a pre @-@ compiled package from your distribution . if you read it , you probably already have done it ...
this section is directed to people who compile of source files , and not for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs , then the following is true for you :
a program that calls for many different programs , has many variants of settings . at best read the step for step example to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the different map slots of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading still ? even if only the help menu was clicked on after the first time schedule , without any of the program , no audio CD ; inside the drive ) , or from un@@ usually short menu ?
what &apos;s it ? who reads this , has probably already started the program . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot think this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual &amp; k@@ audio files ; may it do . at least following the contact with the author . and if you read it , he has left this section with this suggestion .
strange when it succeeded you to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t have this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and caravan player of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he has also some features of real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ aoke @-@ liz@@ ers of lyrics as well as other features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound projec@@ tors which is needed for G@@ US cards once it supports a sequ@@ enz@@ er .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing colour so that it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical display of the activity of each MIDI channel by pressing the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to KM@@ id .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( lyrics or text events ) . KM@@ id automatically det@@ ects the procedures used .
seat support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; during playing a song finish , KM@@ id starts again next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with which you can choose the desired song .
you can also download a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drop windows into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the button to play in the tool bar , select the entry to play from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts as soon as you pull it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces it will be added to a collection and then ab@@ orted afterwards . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump to any position by using the middle button of the mouse and go by the regulator .
if you find that a song becomes too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and on the right of the speed dial , and thus change the recording speed . to return the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two functions : if a piece is played , a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts . press the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics are stored on two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use lyrics , others use lyrics event and again other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better : the event of the event will be selected automatically if you choose to manually set the Karaoke text file . you still have the option to change this automatically when you want to see the other way .
if you want to set a event of event you select from the menu Settings menu entries , or song events . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summar@@ ize . this will be played by the series . in this section stands how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the collection under the item .... click New and specify the name for the collection .
you can also copy the existing collection by clicking on copying and select the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones .
if you have more than a collection , you can set the v@@ aults in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when you leave your application , this collection is not saved . remember what you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be chosen in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button . it appears again in the file dialog , with which you can choose the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic add to the collection .
if automation is activated for the collection , an item is automatically added to the active collection ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) .
if Autom@@ atically add to the collection , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a unit . this collection will then continue to be opened .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removing .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu of the menu game collections , the songs in the order are played as they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random sequence in the menu , the order will be defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the sel@@ ective list on the Karaoke text .
to jump on a song , select the Next song , the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to navigate back to the reverse a song , select the button previous piece , the entry previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection there , and click on the button del@@ etion .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this doesn &apos;t matter if they are stored on leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General MIDI events are translated into events that under@@ stands syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers .
for example , you can create a MIDI map which converts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always plays an trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you have only a sound@@ card , you do not need MIDI map because all sound@@ cards are GM compatible ( including AW@@ E and G@@ US cards , FM radio and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite name ) .
a MIDI map is a text file which stores all necessary settings for the play of a piece .
every section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section which may appear as often as desired . but , for this , each occurrence is a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; An additional key@@ map ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a portion starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is achieved .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so I can provide support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
in this section , as the patches of General MIDI as shown on your specific keyboard , the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equal mark is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds that will need to set the sound with the number M . if your keyboard supports no gun shot ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a gun shot . to do this , bear the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( the gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which audio is in the MIDI file .
please note that here , with the term Drum @-@ Patch of Patch , is a different percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is used to display how sounds are m@@ apped on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
as in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section the sequence of lines is very important , as their presence . they must create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are mainly used to map tones on the per@@ k@@ est @-@ channel . look at the provided key@@ maps .
this section can be used to map a few channels to others . if you wish to replace the first and second channel , you can simply do it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others will need 16 or 9 channels ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 rows , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is shown on the channel N , the key@@ map is used with the name name for this canal . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events are ignored , which will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is always used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ Patch on the per@@ k@@ est @-@ channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio , in which ratio of Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der events are multiplied with the value n , this will be converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used therefore in the map file no dec@@ imal comic .
this setting is used because GM pre @-@ indicates a keyboard that will play a Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der Event with the value 40@@ 96 , a sound higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards will try to play two sounds up to one oct@@ ave up . to try the correct value on your keyboard , you must try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use an MIDI map simply open the MIDI settings dialog . these can be found in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole set of keyboard ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on this keyboard you see which sounds are currently being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . if you have changed an instrument , the button does not display any more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has two different views to display the played tones . the view select in the Settings menu under the point channel view : settings
the pace @-@ LCD display the speed which will play a song . the higher the number , the larger the speed .
you can change the temp@@ o of a song . so , for example , find a song to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that has to be played like a piece of music . it contains the music , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . so the same MIDI file can result in two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB , while a mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have compiled a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( e.g. from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t have any desire to add all the files individually .
agreed , that &apos;s why &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
in advance , check the setting of automatic adding to the collection . otherwise , files are added to the temporary collection .
use the arrow keys on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD panel to slow down playback . to restore the default temp@@ o you can double on the LCD .
I &apos;ve been on a &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or to@@ g@@ gled ( if I want to play a file of MIDI files ) or I want to play a file only in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drag and drop the file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you want to listen to a file only once , without adding them to a collection , turn off the setting of automatic adding to the collection and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . supplement you only want to play the first file . so adjust the setting of automatic adding to the collection and open exactly this one MIDI file .
then join also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid to create and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you so much ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard , encourage me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Anton@@ i@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . in the moment I &apos;m not much spare time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect a bit of time for my hob@@ bies . as a Hob@@ bies , I tried to collect MIDI files , make music and prove phr@@ ases .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write an e @-@ mail : lar@@ ch @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you will really make me a lot of joyful anticip@@ ation , if you send me a postcard from your residence or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group I will include a postcard or a MIDI file , but if you want to send me a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might already have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my free time and I don &apos;t want anybody to get money . I want therefore to complain about when I get back feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Main@@ taining the bug that the pitch of AW@@ E cards was too high .

and of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians in the net which give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ mid ; can also be found on his homepage , which is located under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can see information , search and look at pictures . you can also find links to pages with other Karaoke songs , &amp; etc .
a sound@@ card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality depends greatly on your sound card . it is not the same whether you are using a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you do not have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ D@@ EM@@ O _ ON@@ LY@@ VI@@ SU@@ AL . it then runs as if you could have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear music .
if problems occur , please contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error not@@ ion directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on supported formats , as well as playback of DVD &apos;s , VCD , or TV and camera .

for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Mail@@ ing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the playlist . and finally , there is a window window that is displayed only when you are talking about it .
it is possible to save the preferred connections under the menu bookmark , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries , which should be played after each other , you should use the category of permanent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hier@@ archy level . if you have an entry , its group will copy and all its sub@@ groups to the current category and playback starts with the associated entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do the files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player , but also by using a category . simply click on a name of a category . simply click on a name for a sub@@ group . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML contents of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you must select the same with playlist , and select either the editor mode , or select a different category .
all changes are lost when processing mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation of starting and running can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ lige option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ ver@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at starting does not need to be short , it will automatically termin@@ ate by opening any other source . this would be distur@@ bing if the user can stop the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite photos ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / h ; / h ; / h ; / h ; / h ; / h ; / h ; / h ; / h ; / h ; / h ; / h ; / h ; / h ; / h ; / h ; / h ; / h ; / h ; / h ; / h ; / h ; / h ; / h ; / h ; / h ; / body@@ work ; &amp; gt ; / h ; / body@@ work ; &amp; gt ; / body@@ work ;
there is a tab for configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bl@@ es@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player visi@@ bly .
there is no tab for this playback dialog for this playback dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ mate . here is a sample like a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa game played :
&apos; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be used to insert the special field of Emb@@ ed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
with that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can be used in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as service provider for the M@@ ime Type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog of K@@ DE must be specified .
the Con@@ quer@@ or &amp; &amp; Multi@@ player ; is stored in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding loading of the browser module library . if there is no error , the backup output is inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console or console from the context menu ) .
this should always be a pre@@ emp@@ tive back@@ end for a particular M@@ ime Type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual change of file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on all files will be used :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play on TV cards , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ Player ) . before TV can be watched , the scanner must be used with the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( video data rec@@ orders ) settings in k@@ m@@ player is the dialog in the settings dialog - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ video port to be detected , from which one is selected ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has contained a DVB @-@ in .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ video ( probably this kind of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is why the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be work . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must therefore contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally , from KM@@ Player are used for the sources different names . at the time of development of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , the source @-@ time , pip@@ ette source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if enabled , they begin playing the playlist .
are there evidence how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is run as user root after installing the device . it is absolutely sure to display / dev / c@@ drom on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine is only starting slowly , why must my CPU be tested for performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ l@@ t. k@@ x@@ ine@@ player needs the last stored value automatically , only the first time will check the CPU .

encoding : this is set to use the character encoding . it should use modern systems increasingly using the UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . if applicable , UTF @-@ 8x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; latex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the additional packages used for &amp; latex ; for the integration they contain only to be selected in the check box .
articles ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used in the creation of German texts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; new users are now not worried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only a short description of the functions and further information on this will be given in the section . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - exactly like other source code editors - the pre@@ diction of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by means of a big problem , you should notice that any mathematical environment has not been closed . however , you could recover through the modest appearance of the output file . however , you will save you through the emphasis of time and time .
when setting a new command ( e.g. \ \ \ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates an empty line for input of the text ( e.g. \ \ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and the one @-@ pin line to specify the command ( e.g. \ \ using { command } ) . this function can be disabled in menu settings .. La@@ Te@@ X commands disabled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all documents are normally sub@@ divided into several elements . &amp; latex ; obtaining the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most important and sub@@ divided element ) :
at the view of the document in structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a single click on the respective device .
when creating the own &amp; latex ; files can be very helpful if a DVI ; file &#91; Ger@@ a &#93; file , retri@@ eved &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the relevant line in the &amp; latex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format document and other information such as the font , and is in addition to PDF the technical output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; there are many tools to view , conversion and printing from DVI ; files for various systems and devices .
when used for the inside of the file , the elements of the DVI ; file containing the editor would be connected with the editor of the DVI ; file , and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file , which is clicked on an element in the / latex ; source code clicked , is used for the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer .
Master @-@ Document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document the work is simplified with others . when using a project , a project @-@ wide Master Document can be set to project Project Properties .
fast making : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no error occur in the source code ) .
file watch : in this mode the DVI ; file will be mounted on anywhere , and there is no appeal by &amp; Ok@@ ular ; after the high @-@ speed .
in viewing the editing tool@@ bar , the three gro@@ w@@ ls should be reserved for quick connections in the document . the first selection panel is designed for the quick breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... which are available for the sub@@ division :
the selection panel for further information is such as keywords , foot@@ notes , or references to the selection of articles , such as :
name : with this command a name for a section , a picture or other element is created .
reference : is used for reference to a specified description ( for a selection of a selection box ) .
when using quote is displayed a selection list with literary entries . for &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are necessary only if the file is required to have a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ sockets will be used for defin@@ ing the font . it can be specified for the main text , the foot@@ notes , etc . there are the following fonts for disposal :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection criteria are available : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and set of settings . 2 . the document can be written down by hand .
the cl@@ amps of the \ \ &apos; document@@ a class include the settings for the command . the settings &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font . if the font is set to the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the above source code has been entered the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way to this is the use of the volume of building or of a button .
the source code must be stored before the compile . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
due to the compile of the document , should be searched in the protocol according to the errors . when using quick installation , &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the protocol should also be considered .
a environment ( engl@@ . environment ) is a text that is treated differently than the rest document . for example , a few characters should have a fine font . the \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ &apos; apply a few words . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; \ \ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the changes will only be c@@ auti@@ ous within the environment ( from \ \ \ ) { environment } to \ \ &quot; { environment } ) . there is no coverage ( amount ) for the changes within a environment .
there are many aspects of getting the read@@ ability and us@@ ability of the document . for example , there are certain fonts , grease pressure , cur@@ sive im@@ prints , under@@ lines , etc . these commands end either with the \ \ &apos; s command or automatically at the end of the area .
\ \ &quot; { empi@@ h } : this command is for the ital@@ ic and is long as long as you are closed with a \ \ &apos; { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be illustrated with \ \ &quot; previous { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ \ &quot; { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ &quot; { Qu@@ ote } .
in the background to the writing of the source text with the &amp; latex ; -@@ mark@@ up language was presented , then a step @-@ by @-@ step instruction for the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; .
once a bit text was entered in the wiz@@ ard , a few adjustments were needed for the better read@@ ability of the document . you should need a quote from a few positions in the fat and cur@@ sive and a poem to the application to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , the Editor &apos;s Editor or Str@@ g E can be returned to the editor ( internal viewer ) . at an external viewer , its window needs to be closed .
once the DVI files file is created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and fun .
DVI ; is a device independent file format ( engl . D e V ice I n ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for the legi@@ bility of several drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as you want to create a document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can be printed ( as far as the printer is configured correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar enables the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file generated from the &amp; latex ; source code may begin to capture different formats by means of the P@@ FE standards in the tool@@ bar .
the forward @-@ looking process allows direct move from the editor to the open position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding adjustment for all &amp; latex ; -@@ bin@@ ge files . for this , only modern under Settings K@@ ile needs to set up tools building .
in order to eradi@@ c@@ ate the preferred search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be clicked on a line of the source code . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; the viewer is then sent .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; provided with a click of the middle button of the key in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; latex ; - Document of &amp; k@@ ile ; Ge@@ ar and to the corresponding line ; must be set out in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; set out as text editor ( Settings ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ... editor )
if using quick assembly of the &amp; DVI ; viewer cannot be connected to the viewer , an error may occur . if an error is occurring , it will be displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the protocol file er@@ ings the source code in the source code . in the editor you can always view the string of the La@@ Te@@ X errors and ne@@ b@@ bin of the La@@ Te@@ X errors . to view the defective line , it must be clicked on the error in the logging and &amp; k@@ ile ; jumps to the error line .
once the button is clicked on the tool@@ bar , a window appears for selecting the template used for the document . the default settings are :
when selecting an empty document , a document may be re @-@ written or used to create a new document for the quick preparation of a new document .
Home users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates are created in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file may be opened or create a new file . you can create a new template using your existing document and selection of file templates .
when creating a new document , a new document will be replaced by other data strings ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in settings dialog .
when creating your own template it is necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ON@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by typ@@ ing in document class . typically , it will be used as a : \ \ &apos; CU@@ E &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ON@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard and the instructions of the instructions in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , subsequent steps must be accomplished :
when creating a new document , then you can create your own template instead of the standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files are created . if a simple way is used to create a template , it should be searched in the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for Kate ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many edit@@ ings to be made directly from &amp; k@@ ile .
to learn more about Kate and Kate ; and its kind of mapping is to be used to explore the book of Kate . users by &amp; k@@ ile ; you can start reading right there with reading the chapter works with the editor of Kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; latex ; command line , which can be called for the men@@ tioning of the La@@ Te@@ X reference . you reveal a detailed description of almost all commands , which can be used in &amp; latex ; use can be used as well as their syntax .
a double click with a button closure to specify the &amp; tex ; that means that in this way , click the \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par .
when drawing the text with cooled left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with penet@@ rated switch , can be selected parts of the source text in the Edit@@ or@@ Window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the ability to search and emphas@@ ize the most diverse types of source texts and emphas@@ ize these . for example , the &amp; latex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas can be highlighted by another color .
many Assist@@ ants to be able to apply spring@@ time marks . this is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . the men@@ tioning are highlighted . this jump stamp is highlighted even so that they are automatically included in the first input of a character .
the Edit is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; already excellent mapping so many environments and groups and therefore emphas@@ izes many environments and groups and therefore emphas@@ izes the following commands to select the text of the text :
holds a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing on both sides an empty line ) . this extended meaning does not include tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only bent thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is therefore the only bending of two empty lines separated .
the word sets the word beneath the current cur@@ ial position . this choice also has an extended importance since this command is also &amp; latex ; commands with a flush area ( * ) at the end of all .
to view a part of the document , Nat@@ Ã ¼ r@@ lich will be selected first and selected by pressing key C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers its own commands to make a faster result . under editing the following commands are contained to the following commands :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of editing AUS@@ T@@ Ã ¼ h@@ len paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments such as a central role in &amp; latex ; play . therefore &amp; k@@ ile ; for more commands under editing environment for an easy work with &amp; latex ; .
with this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to reach the surrounding area .
with this command will jump to the end of the current area ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the surroundings .
if the cursor is located before or within the instruction \ \ \ &apos; s { environment } , will be spra@@ yed towards the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many til@@ ted ambient conditions , the change has to be lost quickly . this command re@@ sem@@ bling the last environment , so the til@@ ting environment structure is not dismant@@ led .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special instructions for the &amp; latex ; groups , which are determined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X groups are some important commands to meet those from the editing environment .
with this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the welded flush .
with this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the welded shut@@ ters .
when the cursor is present or behind the welded lum@@ ber of a &amp; tex ; -@@ Group # is , the other end of the group jump ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many welded groups @-@ stap@@ les can be lost quickly the change view . this command re@@ sem@@ bling the last group , so the ha@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups cannot be dismant@@ led .
in &amp; latex ; two simple beginners are used to be used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign is used for two simple beginners . also for the end of the first time the sign &apos; is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for two sleeping entry signs for &amp; latex ; one .
this automatic comes of double beginners can be set up and set off under Settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X .
you can also have specific settings ( e.g. native or French ) , and thus German or French initial signs can be used . there are also many other languages available .
in the shift of shift ; input clay paste for an intelligent line breaks . if the current position is located inside a lists area ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , for example , not only a line breaks , but also the \ \ item command .
in a tables surrounding the current line , \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to emphas@@ ize pre@@ set &amp; latex ; - or custom @-@ defined environments . these can be added under settings ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
some users can view the columns in tables environments and thus all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) and all E@@ t characters ; if this tab@@ ulator is not one of the recommended tab@@ ulator in the underlying column . even though this tab@@ ulator is not the one part , add up &amp; k@@ ile ; add the columns for the columns to the current tab@@ ulator .
though &amp; Kate ; already a good source code accompl@@ ishment has been built in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special orders ( mostly available for &amp; latex ; ) three different modes are fitted . all these modes can be set up for automatic transm@@ itting . all these modes can be set up for different ways of work .
when comm@@ itting a new environment by means of the \ \ \ &apos; s \ \ &apos; s instruction , &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically added to the \ \ &apos; s instruction to an empty line ( for the text ) .
when filling the space bar , the last letter of the input is removed and allows you to change the ful@@ fill@@ ment list . on the other hand , the list may also shr@@ ink by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are attached to the selection of a command . alternatively , a simple jump to these positions is possible to reach these positions by means of Edit Ho@@ wever , and the desired parameters can be frozen .
under Settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; ful@@ ler settings to these lists can be performed . there can be different thick@@ ets for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; orders , as well as broad@@ casts of the general language used .
the command mode is not subject to the complete compensation of environments . in the other hand , a large list with ambient applications will always be specified . on the other hand , the environment is used as often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode is used for simpli@@ fication of environments .
when calling the event mode , the Men@@ Ã ¼ editing area or the CTR@@ L + Shift key , the command will be automatically tran@@ scri@@ bed to the environment , and it appears to be carried out on the way \ \ \ &quot; s environment . afterwards , the ambient can be carried out in the sim@@ pl@@ est way by pressing the input key .
after this is done , the environment will be closed again automatically . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognise that it is a Listen environment , will even have a first \ \ item order .
set up to@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; ful@@ ler settings to these lists can be performed . this mode uses the complete list of termination mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; under@@ lines custom@@ iz@@ able user defined lists of devi@@ ations that are replaced immediately by more aci@@ dic string chains . as an example of a replacement parts list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l is used , for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the result is contained L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
for example , the letter L entered and the word of full termination by the menu or the CTR@@ L + Alt + Alt + Alt + Alt + Alt + Alt + Alt + Alt + Alt + by the string is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large open wa@@ ist@@ ers are not helpful for automatic transm@@ itting in a document . however , there are many years to be written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ile ; the accompl@@ ishment of all already written powers .
this mode can be set up in the settings dialog ... K@@ ile swallowed . here also the swelling of the order can be specified .
the ful@@ fill@@ ment files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / c@@ ile / lin@@ k@@ ile / lin@@ ux / lin@@ ux / c / etc / c / lin@@ ux . mode is available for lev@@ elling ( waste ) , Dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dialog graphics are designed for graphics as simple as possible . to view the fundament@@ als of the basics on the graphics formats , the sections should be considered and considered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PS files are not as familiar as PDF files , but offer a excellent basis for the changes and new orders of pages . will be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script , tools , and then with ps@@ 2@@ pdf will be converted to a PDF file .
in order to view the outcome of the work , the source code must be compiled . all building tools are group@@ ed in the form creating comp@@ iling , creating converting and creating view .
for the compile of the source code for the viewer as &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; or the further conversion can be used by the CTR@@ L ; 2 by the default , via Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file and can be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the instruction manual , a viewer will normally be called after the compile . no incoming viewer should be used , each time a new window appears .
a new project will be asked about the project Project .... See the following information for the project :
when selecting the file name window , the relative path must be given from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function from &amp; k@@ ile ; allows you to in@@ corporate EC@@ C and code scripts . the scripts can be administ@@ rated in vertical bars .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be found in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile .
first you have to say that the installation environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a wide object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&amp; latex ; is a very pronounced system in which the basic functions are extended by a multitude of multiple packages to be enlarged . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ as ; they are supplied with many documents . included are a documentation for the contained packages and a further &amp; latex ; reference .
a fully integrated Re@@ friger@@ ator for &amp; tex ; and its e@@ â ¬ ces of fri@@ gates ( but a few important pack@@ ets are described ) but rather a complete manual for a specific form . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; listed in three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ as ; delivered live , finding the correct document is not always easy ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which is a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; supplied documents and this for a graphic upper area .
all documents are divided into categories and the scanned advantage is the search for par@@ cel names or percussion . by &amp; k@@ ile ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ click with your mouse or the space of the space bar to the viewer for the document .

&amp; Fast ; is a graphic editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . by using the command @-@ line interface , you can create random signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the signatures for external e @-@ mail programmes like &amp; K@@ Mail .
for random Sig@@ nat@@ ures , any signature is made of the signature file by &amp; co@@ sig ; read by many signatures with different quotes , styles and informations you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for daily sig@@ natur will be read by the same signature for the whole day . for each day you can use different signatures , such as the random Sig@@ nat@@ ures , create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N file New . this will receive an empty signature ; in the lower section Sig@@ nat@@ ures ; click on the Sig@@ nat@@ ures section ; add it with C@@ trl ; S file , or click on the floppy symbol Save .

version 3.2 of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all these tools are used as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ l as a base . the combination provides fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
anyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has been working on it , pro@@ c and how over@@ hanging it is . if we are still looking for a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer clicked on a terminal ; simply click on the icon for the XML processor and finished !
this application is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is located in a ge@@ ared field file , then remove the current running folder and specify the selection of current working folders and specify it in the folder of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time if Not@@ pro@@ c is started .
as I said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical interface .
when the opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , then they just leave the current running folder , if not , then select the current folder and specify the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to a output on screen , their file is fla@@ wed . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file checking file is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then they release the current file simply . if not , you delete the check @-@ file in the current file using other file - file selection .
if you just want to know if the well @-@ level file is , click the well @-@ to check menu .
for use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file specified , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( internal ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by Defin@@ itions for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG review , the specification of the definition @-@ UR@@ I ; in the file selection are required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file output file should be marked in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then you let the current file simply be selected . if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file .
enter the name of the file , as the result is to have named , . the file is normally saved in its home folder .
the plug @-@ in , the &amp; quantum @-@ l@@ us ; even might have little to do . this means that the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and you don &apos;t have to wait until someone can use the cables in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements can be used below .
to install a plug@@ in or a part , we start with the menu plug @-@ in . so the following dialogue will be opened :
this dialog allows you to manage all of the plug@@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI element :
here you can input the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a storage location uses &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to find the plug@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; often people work together in a project several people in a type of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Supp@@ orting team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nickname and is used for unique identi@@ fying .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team manager and Sub@@ project Manager .
the user can look for himself from the list of the members of the team who is looking for . this happens by selecting the Team Member from the list and pressing the S@@ etz@@ e button . the currently selected member ( its identification ) appears fat after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the attitude of their own identity are important regarding news and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to the overview of your team , there is another advantage by recording the members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team manager if something specific is happening . see for further information .
event promotions are actions which are executed when something specific in the project is happening . an example would be the recording of the opening and shut@@ ting of the project , if a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file into CVS soon as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the side event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties Find out events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ sources selected in the receiver list . the mailing can be a team or Sub@@ project Manager . see in , we@@ i such ladder to be established .
comments are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
note : it is easy to select either the Note -@@ entry from the editor @-@ context menu or text @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by typ@@ ing text .
note : note : the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( top name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( Role ) , the nickname of the introduced nickname for the team member , is a role in the project from the following possibilities : team@@ leader , Sub@@ project leader , should be given the appropriate range or sub@@ project names , as in the examples below .
nick@@ names and roles are independent of bulk or small prescri@@ ption , but spaces are invalid for the cl@@ amps and the following : make the note invalid .
&amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ atting , which is supported by DT@@ D @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic and web @-@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are dealt , a short description for others can be found in .
the settings can be set up with a quantum ... Find dialog box extends over a few pages that are treated over each other .
the behaviour of &amp; quantitative ap@@ us ; regarding tags of a car order can thus be changed . the entries are :
large / small write of tags : large / small prescri@@ ption of tags : normal mine / lower@@ case signi@@ fies the tags , as they are described in the day XML files .
large / small write of attributes : large / small prescri@@ ption of an automatically added attributes . normal wholesale / lower@@ case signi@@ fies , the attributes are inserted as described in the tag@@ on XML files .
optional tags : if requested , is optional for tags , for which the closing tag is optional , this is immediately inserted after the &amp; gt ;
not optional tags : as above for all other tags , except for simple tags .
start and closing tag automatically : if enabled , the closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic acc@@ ent of acc@@ ent characters : ste@@ ers the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters in appropriate coding during typ@@ ing .
M@@ IME types : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ s for detect different types of files . by using button standard , the default values can be restored .
default coding : the coding of newly created or in other ways than opened open files ( where the encoding of the file may be passed ) . this setting here will be exp@@ elled from the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . this setting here is produced by the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; creates regular backup copies , so that for a power failure or crash when the program can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . again , a backup is regularly created , according to the set time , created .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Edit@@ or@@ field or its own view ( or documentation on a tab ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and the code simultaneously .
set the window settings to the standard back at the next start is useful if the user interface by changing the MDI modes and inter@@ locks / depends on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning domain allows you to control the display of war@@ nings by no longer in@@ quire .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can change the display of symbols as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ S and source code view in divided mode .
here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which shows the figure of the Par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des in the document , can be adjusted in detail .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to am@@ end the action by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the field of structural tree settings the visibility of no@@ des in the tree can be opened automatically while in a change in structure tree . empty knots are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such , in which no element found in the current document .
the area to set short@@ cuts ( a type of templates ) which are developed in the editing of more extensive text . abst@@ rac@@ tions are valid in groups , each can be valid for several &amp; DT@@ EP . this means that there can be a valid group for PHP , which means that there is something different means in a group valid for Javascript .
plug@@ ins can be administ@@ rated here . plug@@ ins are K@@ part applications from third side , which can be re @-@ used by each of the K@@ part @-@ capable application , at the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be given :
address : the path to the plug@@ in , if it is not at a standard resort such as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information will be opened to the plug @-@ in , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folders ( path of current file ) or to the project folder .
component in the &quot; Only @-@ read &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in ref@@ uses the charging . only @-@ read @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse the load when this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is activated , then checks &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; whether the entered information is correct . if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , it will be installed later .
for &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bl@@ es@@ hooting has been developed completely new . the support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Debug@@ ger was used , as well as the support for the d@@ b@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ in concept was implemented , which enables various implementation of plug@@ ins .
currently only a plug @-@ in is available which adds support to the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; add .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the use of a de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a matching de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in . with the options next to the de@@ bug@@ ging plug @-@ in box , the specific settings can be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view that is displayed in the content of monitored variables is usually in the left dock .
a View that lists all holding points , with line numbers and conditions . appears normally in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) is normally displayed in the lower dock .
depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything is available or part of the following functionality .
with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or she shares the plug@@ in with , on Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ ean claims to listen . this action is used as default , which is a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that the normal case does not have to be considered .
the counter@@ part of de@@ bug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to a de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements .
sends a HTTP requirement to the server to enter a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the view de@@ bug@@ ging issue .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , to start the execution of the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently issued line , the execution is carried out . if this is done , the execution starts with the requirement .
points the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the design of the script without sending information about monitored variables and the current c@@ il@@ en@@ code . if this happens while a script is given , the execution proceeds as soon as a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or includes features .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script , where possible when it is possible in functions and includes features .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , to skip the directive and to go to the next one , there would be the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the super@@ vised value appears in the variation view .
with this dialog , a variable may be entered or a new value of a variable will be set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale like this part of the documentary . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; Front @-@ end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that they can find on htt@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter explains how you can adjust &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; adapt to your needs and how you can &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help you get better .
document type editing packages ( DT@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to provide support for marketing and scrip@@ ting languages as well as to CSS ; your simplicity and flexibility makes us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s are available in two ways , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script language and / CSS ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ .@@ Tool@@ bar , the text and instructions are inser@@ ting faster into a document than one user might have .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see details for the conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , a &amp; DT@@ EP .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the properties dial@@ og@@ es , the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; even . tool bars offer a quick inser@@ tion of tags in a document without any risk of writing .
tag folders are not a folder . they contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders include the name of the descri@@ bing language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declare whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible to give other users a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits will be presented in a simple manner .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but does not contain only one element type about himself .
type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the day of booking class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type Method Method . gives the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
set a text in the dialog . this text is determined by &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an only element type element .
describes an attribute of an tags . this element can only occur once for each attribute . additionally , it contains other tags that will describe as this attribute is to be shown &amp; etc ; This is an only element type element .
releases the source code used for filling the attributes in the tag editor and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quantum @-@ l@@ us ; is used to reach source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; quantum @-@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and method@@ ology . the arguments that will be handed over to the method . can be empty or % day , that means the name of the current tags .
a container day that contains the elements of a list together . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is a merely element type element .
specifies the position of an attribute of an tags within a dialog . this day can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( for example for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in the dialog . this day should be available for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
indicates a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is a only element type .
lists a list of elements that end a tag . this element is an only element type .
all the Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; -@@ declar@@ ations start : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces affect nothing , but look on &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; code &gt; will not cause a leg breaks , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is to start in the &amp; Qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and review Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . currently , verification is performed only during charging the Tag@@ XML @-@ files in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; Element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; file name . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this conference XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this conference XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &apos; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &apos; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; -- &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is a editor that can be edited via DT@@ D . thus di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP . should be edited for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it should be a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries are created :
&#91; general &#93; Version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D information . ( - / / W@@ 3C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nickname .
an action can be set up with Settings .... click on New action leads to the same dialog :
this action assigned to this action . with clicking the User button a short@@ cut can be assigned , with K@@ einer is the current short@@ cut .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered in the Det@@ ect settings and when exec@@ uting this text , this text is inserted in the document on the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action of action . with the help of this action you can use external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to use the document or as input ( or parts of the document ) ; even the quick@@ start @-@ dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EPs .
first the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be given . example : S@@ H / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % script@@ dir variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Quant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line :
% f : we will be replaced using the current document URL . in case of a local document it will be deleted from the document &apos;s name .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the running &amp; quantum le@@ us ; only one instance is running , the text unique is added to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; quantum @-@ l@@ us ; from the external script .
parameter for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the indicated methods there can be a script input from &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; at default input can be specified , which can be sent to the default input . options are :
select text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful .
according to the input , the output of the issued application can also be di@@ ver@@ ted . there are two kinds of issue : normal edition , on the standard output ; error messages which is to be done with the default output format , given the value the selection field output is set to :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create tags in logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create one &apos;s own tool@@ bar . in the given case it &apos;s not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings promotions .
the parts of this window are quite self explan@@ atory . press the new action at the bottom of the window starts Edit mode .
fill in all the required fields and add them to the matching tool bar .
complete everything and , if the tag has Attri@@ butes , and you can plan their use , activate dialog &quot; Tag , &quot; when available to entering the use of the action is possible .
ignor@@ ing ! is it a ugly symbol . who should notice the action in conjunction with this symbol ? will we replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; k@@ icon@@ edit ; use from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , Graphics More programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ icon@@ edit ; used as standard 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
in terms of that the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as less , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user is sign@@ alized that clicking this symbol will insert a &amp; lt ; -@@ day in the current document .
after creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action . this happens over the menu with Settings promotions ... ( in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the required action . in addition to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the button and continue with other tags , so it still exists , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; quantum d@@ us ; functions to tool@@ bar , or it should set it to better overview by several separate separ@@ ators into several groups . make sure the tool bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( top left ) for my tool bar . after choosing the element to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the tool@@ bar item to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I want to preview quick access to the kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . anyone who does not know my tool bar , could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool bar must be tested by using all symbols , to make sure everything works .
back up in the correct folder . after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the correct folder , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust your tool bar ( s ) if a file is opened by the corresponding type .
perhaps the most mentioned extension of &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ atting language you like . therefore , this chapter explains how to create a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you might test in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; re@@ os@@ it@@ ory if someone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . we &apos;ll need to send the first part to you , the second we treat here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc you = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , for example php@@ 42 / # elements in the main index page element = your description for such document@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Section Section 2 = &gt; 1.@@ html Section 2 = func@@ 1.@@ html , 2 = func@@ 1.@@ html to Day 2 = Day 2.@@ html to Day 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree . for example , you can now see in the PHP &amp; PHP ; documentation such as :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = php@@ 42 / # top level element = database of Cont@@ ents , # Getting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html Getting Start@@ ed = Introduction = Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax ... basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax ...
note the # before getting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the hor@@ set@@ ups ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the index is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quantitative information ; resources are replaced .
the section section is the range of doc@@ r@@ c file which is intended to display the context of context @-@ sensitive help . by selecting the function name and press of C@@ trl ; H for context @-@ help , the documentation would be shown directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file extension lines .
a simple list of using separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of PHP / PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file doc@@ r@@ c , namely the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / quantum / apps / quantum / apps for local or global use . then create a folder ( such as doc@@ r@@ c ) and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these good and well worth are shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , for example which documentation was used to use the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked on the best web developer platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ ating resources ( DT@@ EP @-@ packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . at different places there is an e @-@ mail menu entry , like DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) , send the tool@@ bar with Email , in context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripts tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ users are checked and only available when our team takes them as accurate and usable for the publication , why it uses a GP@@ G / PGP key . thus , the source of resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for later users .
when up@@ loading you are asked for their private GP@@ G keys ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have several keys , you can select an input fields ( URL preview can be empty ) and by clicking OK the upload will be launched .
the up@@ loading can also upload from the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and in context menu of files and folders in templates and scrip@@ ting tree .
after downloading a resource , nor before installing , &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by review of integrity and Sig@@ ni@@ fication . in case of problems it can be can@@ cel@@ ed . if the integrity are given and the resource is correct , a message appears with the author of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages , which is currently not produced by &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; but it can be time consuming , because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in day XML format . there &apos;s easier way to convert DT@@ D to a DT@@ D package automatically .
the conversion can start from the DT@@ D shop and converting a DT@@ D menu . select the .@@ dt@@ d file containing the DT@@ D description , which should be used . then the following dialog appears :
target name : the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Quant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! doc@@ type Defin@@ ing line : the character string , which in ! Doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ v@@ 3.@@ org / / EN htt@@ p / / EN htt@@ p / / EN htt@@ p / / EN htt@@ p / / EN htt@@ p / / EN / 4.0@@ 4 /
adjustment of the DT@@ EP after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to understand this and to understand the full use of &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this chapter one must first be entru@@ sted to these fundamental concepts . this chapter will be exactly to accommodate these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little use brow@@ ned .
in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , locally and projection . this distinction affects a range of components in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
global elements are for everyone , the &amp; quantum d@@ us ; available , available in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administ@@ rators of various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree to be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements are a personal collection of web development means for a single user . these are custom patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can use only this user personally .
project related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; this is the most limited size for the files of a specific project . simply , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which means the joint use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ MDI ; consists of some main areas : the editing window , the man@@ ders , the map drivers with information and tool@@ bars . please note in , and for further information on these areas .
you can click the tab with the right mouse button to re@@ load a context menu with the current document , like close to the current , other or all flash@@ ers , re@@ loading , or up@@ loading the document , skip to a book@@ marks or exec@@ uting CVS commands to the current document .
right click in the Edit@@ or@@ Area to a further context menu in terms of the edited documentation , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the file via the mouse poin@@ ter or opening the file , if the string is specified below the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the upper end of the editor tool@@ bar is the tool bar . currently , &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional is shown as a standard for which a set of tool bar is shown . in the course of further extension of tool bar , the tool bars are adapted to new functions and related user needs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the use of tool bar is really easy . if they want to insert it simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; in your document , click on the icon that has to insert the tag , which has several attributes ( as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anchor ) &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can fill in a dialog box different fields . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the software prospects ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to open and strip it . in the presentation with divider , files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project Management is a powerful tool , the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; providing all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading , or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be performed with the displayed context menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , whole website &amp; etc . all options are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what connection they are used . the category is always available , local templates are available for the appropriate user and templates in projects are only available in the project . more to templates is in finding .
here you find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of the integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the information available to a script , such as the script to start , edit or send the script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on a element it will set the cursor in the document on the position of the element . by the right click of an element it opens a list of commands related to navigation and view of the tree .
this tree appears among other respects . it can change man@@ age@@ able attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces with it . it allows modification of all available attributes with few mouse clicks .
here you can find documentation for the Web @-@ Techni@@ que for your development . there can be pre@@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; document@@ ations site can download , and by adding a folder doc to a project can make project specific documentation , edited and considered .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us has two flash@@ ers at the bottom end of the window , which can be reached via the beneficial information : the message window and the problem window .
this map displays information about any running script in Quant@@ a script . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of current document and all the changes to DT@@ D is displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the market @-@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the st@@ ak@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate bar of the tool bar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool bar with email . &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; send the tool bar as a compressed T@@ ar @-@ Archive via &amp; K@@ mail ; if they receive a tool bar in an email , they can ass@@ ure them and load up to each other !
it &apos;s reasonable if you want to customize the place of &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options to get to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , specify . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have any problems starting from Start &amp; Qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check whether your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folders . also , you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PAT@@ H prior to your bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ;
&amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; was optimized for a fast web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while effort , creating the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; an independent , ext@@ endable Mark@@ up languages would ? well , this would make him the absolutely gran@@ dest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now already wide on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . if you can define it in &amp; XML , then &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for that the appropriate &amp; IDE ; its .
well , to the af@@ ore@@ mentioned claim must be stated that &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development of Why does anybody else develop ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ odo@@ urs is not only possible , but allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to expand it as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows Web@@ developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can increase your productivity dramatically . using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool bars , they can expand &amp; qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; without having to notice any scrip@@ ting syntax without having a scrip@@ ting syntax . ( more about it in . )
&amp; Quant@@ a ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and quickly upgraded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Quant@@ a ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the details can be discussed with help : / Quant@@ a ( either via this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; type or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Quant@@ a ) .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; is currently developed and super@@ vised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ ined @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you can open a file which is not on it , the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only a bug is reported .
when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board , special characters included in the clip@@ board , so that they are displayed correctly and not be understood as form@@ atting instruction .
converts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; write the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to add &amp; URL ; s into the anchor day .
switch the block selection to or from . that allows you to choose text blocks with the help of the Shift key .
go straight to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script will issue error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expression to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
exit and adjustment of the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom edge of the &amp; quantum @-@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as one turns to the structure tree .
displays the tool@@ bar links from the main window . this column allows you to bookmark this page with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with entries of previous or next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents will be group@@ ed in the menu following the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are saved with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory to new files that could be there . that allows you to copy graphics files to your project folders or sub@@ folder , and then add it to the project .
downloads the files in your project up to the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . chapter &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are explained for details .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in the project you / Tool@@ bars and are only included in this menu , if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
open a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved by settings . tool@@ bar must be saved by tool bar , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool bar from the field of vision . this del@@ etes it from your hard disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do this .
so you can send your own tool bar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; Qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Team , so that the tool bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool bar as attachment .
allows the up@@ loading of tool bars on the main panel , where any other can access it . see in .
loading a &amp; DT@@ D ; you have done or any other of others and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
loading / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; is useful if the entities from the &amp; DT@@ EP ; to renew themselves without the whole &amp; DT@@ EP ; if this is globally and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the store fails .
this menu includes a list of tags that are available in the currently loaded materials . if the standard ( HTML ) tool@@ bar is available , there is a sub @-@ menu item which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows to access the current tag dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tag , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu .
activated or disable the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; the inser@@ tion by tool@@ bar is ref@@ using to this place the rules contra@@ dict .
the plug @-@ ins available in the menu item are listed below the menu items listed above . click them to select any activated plug@@ ins .
select the syntax rate mode for the current file . the list of available development schem@@ es depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
choose the type of c@@ edar . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document based on selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by using the external application T@@ id@@ y .
instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , change sometimes need time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the default mode , or the default mode , which corresponds to the presentation in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting a request the corresponding sub @-@ window will be activated .
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; master window .
changes in this dialog appears every application which use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
the behaviour of editing window works . in the documentation of &amp; Kate , you can find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete or add entries from the tool@@ bar .
this should generate a help according to the mouse sphere &apos;s environment , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with every open source project the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; quantum @-@ l@@ us ; development into financial form , please find the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed by the top of the project named the entire directory structure for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information areas may later be set with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when typ@@ ing Name , file is automatically completed .
this is the name of the qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can see the server address of the machine , on which one wants to access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ Example .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default log will be used , depending on the remote computer &apos;s setting , an adaptation could be necessary .
this is the folder where templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder will be set instead of the standards .
this is the folder where the tool bar can be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default Tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files for different projects is used , this folder will be set instead of the standards .
this allows to app@@ end files from the local fil@@ esystem in the project . multiple files or whole folders can be selected .
this setting is great , if you have static web content you want to download and change . if scripts are different , e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed otherwise .
this , if files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be mounted . if a project is rest@@ art@@ ed from scratch .
with this option , all the files and folders are displayed inside the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to home .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the files you want to choose from or , by removing the tick , cl@@ inging from the project .
the last screen of the new project assist@@ ants contains three settings , which can simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can also be uploaded to the menu for project @-@ properties in the menu area or using the Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholder possible ) , which will be ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
in addition , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or are excluded from the project .
the projec@@ tions , which is loaded when opening the project . can be read more about project views .
this allows you to choose the de@@ bu@@ gger . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be set in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in can be used with the options .
in the sub @-@ window profiles can be uploaded as well ( see in ) as well as the display of a module for the content of the server for each profile , by drawing a separate building view for each profile .
in the sub @-@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details .
in the sub @-@ window event configuration , one can turn event actions and add those actions , change or delete events . event actions are executed when an event occurred in a previously specific event , such as the backup of a file .
by default , qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project which was opened . this behavior can &apos;t influence at the moment .
to open another project , select project ... from the menu project or the symbol project opening from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you upload a new project .
the project design gives free access to the files in the project . there , files can be managed in the current project .
file be@@ have as well , the entries are missing and open with ... in the right button of the key context menu :
here various profiles can be selected . the profile contains information on the place of the uploaded files .
allows removing the current profile . if only more a profile is available , the button is hidden to prevent removing .
the password will be stored in the core memory and password is forgotten . this option is useful when common up@@ loading files is necessary and the more un@@ secure password on the disk can not be stored .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind prior to up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high @-@ loading profiles can be created and can be uploaded to a different server using the project ( or parts of the project ) . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the server name to copy the files . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . usually this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not run a service at the usual port .
depending on your ang@@ st shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it after your discretion . the password will be stored on the disk , so that it can &apos;t be easily read , but anyone can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool bar . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simple changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently open files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored in the project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via the tool bar tool@@ bar , opened or er@@ ased .
this chapter covers the parts of &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has most to do . this does not only increase productivity , but also allows adjusting &amp; qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to its own working method .
as mentioned above are tool bar in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best available via the tool@@ bar . use and add @-@ to @-@ tool@@ bar . adding tool bars is covered below in the section Add tool bar .
the tool@@ bars and the symbols on it can be set either through context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) to create another tool@@ bar , which can be specified in the dialog , where specified in the dialog , where actions may be displayed on this or other tool@@ bar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool bar , the entries will be removed and action ordered that are self explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings tool@@ bars ... and set Settings promotions .. set .
templates are in key document skel@@ et@@ ons , code Schnitz@@ el and files for connecting . &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; templates like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory in the stock space . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limitations that you prepare for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the start of any template before use .
binary is everything that is not pure text . it can be every file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; binary templates are usually inserted in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. photos with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are available in the pre@@ storage space under global templates . more information on templates tree is available in .
documents can be created from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally a simple framework for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in a corresponding way to be efficient . some examples may be found in the pre@@ storage space among global templates . see in for more information on templates tree .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document will always be inserted in the documents from a comment on a template , but the same text area to a complete menu system based on Javascript or Perl . some examples are listed in the pre@@ storage space under global templates . see for more information on templates tree .
as the name says , these templates are for whole sites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure . there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us for this .
design a document structure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As template as local template . ....
once this is done , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the repository . look at the pre@@ storage space under project templates .
select text in your document , and click on File As template . alternatively , select the selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drawn with drag and drop to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file will only be used in a template file . all file management functions can be used , such as drag and insert or insert the file tree from Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click a folder in the file tree or in the repository tree view to create a folder and secure a name for the template and secure it . by default , it can be saved as local or global template as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented advance mode . you can insert header and foot@@ er with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link with them . in addition , you can find some things while using templates in projects very deep inside the eye .
the template structure in the sub @-@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / quantum / apps / Quant@@ a / templates / templates / apps / Quant@@ a / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates . each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of containers , as explained above .
in order to set the behavior of a folder , in the template list with the right mouse button , click the folder and select in context menu properties . the following dialog appears :
a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text , or templates . this selection is hidden when al@@ lied attributes are inherited .
this is enabled by default and it fits for everything except for common folders . if a regular folder would be enabled , it would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , it &apos;s probably located in a regular folder .
allows to lead or recre@@ ate text for templates in this folder . this could be general header or foot@@ er for all templates for a particular project , and allows copying contents to a file with special header lines / foot@@ er a whole present already with the matching fe@@ eder lines / foot @-@ rows .
in addition , you will also have a context menu ( shown to press right mouse button ) using a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor that can be reached via the main menu view . the first mode replaces the source window in two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it charges a document as a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and switch to the source code editor , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor to a document , the &amp; PHP ; contains a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ itself of &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editing and PHP ; it is still necessary to edit this code editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously , this mode is already active , and the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke to the active cursor from a window to another , whereby the position is retained in the document .
the synchron@@ ization gap between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor is adjustable via Properties Quant@@ a .... After selecting from V@@ PL , you can automatically choose between synchron@@ ization according to one click or automatically . in general , the Recomm@@ end@@ ation : a small cre@@ ep for fast calcul@@ ator and a large span for slow .
if you want to change the title of the website , the editing of invisible tags is possible . thus , the editing of invisible tags is possible , as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; the document serves as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; it can be used following :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click into the list enables the change of content e.g. keywords on the name and keyword Key Word on the content -@@ column .
CSS @-@ rules are the new way to create or delete pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS laws using the list below . editing the list is just as possible with the met@@ a @-@ elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS styl@@ ing template , pressing the file open button and select the corresponding file .
the use of the cur@@ s@@ ors is possible like in a word processing , because of the arrows , possible with the arrows , possible . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing or removed from the button .
inser@@ ting tags in the same way will be done in the same way about the tool@@ bars , as in the source code editor , if an anchor tag is not removed , e.g. if an anchor tag is inserted , it must be removed from the other side anchor day .
some tool@@ bars such as the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will work in this release must be used the tables or lists of tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for examination of style sheets . in contrast to other programs for style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style template can be pursued .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; you need besides &amp; k@@ de ; even the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already available at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available .

there are many graphical tools for comparison . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merger was very complicated because one of the contributions made many changes and at the same time changed the rec@@ ir@@ culation at many places . another programmer had changed much text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts with merge .
the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there were no indications concerning the places where maybe only the entry had changed . the merge of these changes was a small mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences in line and changes on white signs . later , a lot of more useful features were added .
for example , if you want to compare it quickly , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison window .
a function made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function transformed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; nearly in a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way co@@ hes@@ ion is fully supported . this is useful when two persons are independent from one piece of co@@ d and make changes to the resulting changes . in this editor you can even edit the result . in this editor you can even process the result directly . the screenshot shows three Qu@@ ell files when assem@@ bling :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you to merge and merge the complete folder . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder format :
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and indicate the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often need to check it out , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are visible visible . if lines only differ in certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble when somebody is modi@@ fying the rec@@ ir@@ culation . )
when a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , the color indicates , which file is different . red color means that both are different to different files .
if all files are in the same name , but in different folders , then you can ease the typ@@ ing work by writing only the file name of the first file . example :
2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 folder Fol@@ der 2 folder Fol@@ der Fol@@ der
the Open dialog allows the manual setting of file names , the selection of the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting an lastly open file from the drop @-@ down list . you will need to specify a third file for next time ; when you leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences with two files will be performed .
over the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the default or merge folders will be selected , for B and C , however , use a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
if mer@@ ging is checked , the input field is active for goal and is not necessarily required to specify an output file immediately . you can do this step later while saving .
setting this setting opens up a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start compar@@ ing / merge .
sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison should be chosen , you can simply close the dialog with the break button .
you can also drag and drop them : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from one editor and leave it over a comparison window .
which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar to these functions , it would be a relatively large effort . you would need to compare two appropriate files to copy them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; and now you can easily copy , paste and compare these files .
note : currently , you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; to diff@@ 3 ; just drop off text in a compar@@ ative window is supported .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the pulling and removal of text into another program as cutting and inser@@ tion ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data might be lost .
in the upper part of each word window is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B , or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( if the path is too long , leave the mouse a while over the line . then a small support window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are associated with letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pre@@ ferences can be changed via the settings menu ) .
when a difference is recognized , you can see the colour which file differs . if both files are different , the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is very useful in the next section ( merge ) .
left next to the text , the column is displayed . if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to only see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , for example , white characters are only in strings and comments , relevant to the Pre@@ processor and in few , rare items . )
the vertical line separates the summar@@ ization column of the text , where the respective source file has no lines . if the line is revers@@ ed , the line appears on broken lines .
the result window ( in the comparison window ) also has an information line with the written output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ changes &#93; if you have edited the result . normally it contains by the automatic interaction already text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dis@@ b@@ anded , saving disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to select hard / un@@ solved / un@@ solved conflict to find the still remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isons can be used , each difference is also a conflict which needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed in all windows . ( this group will also be displayed with the color background color for the current area and each appears on the left ) a black bar .
sometimes there is no further line left through the automatic interaction or by manual editing no further line is left in the group ; this text is only displayed in the case that you might change your mind and maybe again select another source . this text appears neither in the final file , nor in a marking you might copy and paste it somewhere else .
text &amp; lt ; Con@@ duc@@ tions , however , appears in the clip@@ board when copying such text from the result window . carefully go with this function .
note : if choosing the sources to ignore or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated as white characters .
navigate with your mouse blades and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard , but you can use the arrow keys on your left , right , end , C@@ trl @-@ beginning and C@@ trl @-@ end , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs . the over@@ sight column can also be used by clicking here also to navigate .
in the eye window you can also use the other keys to edit . with the add @-@ on button you can switch between inser@@ tion and transfer mode . ( default is the plug @-@ in mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows at the beginning of each group ( as already explained in the section together and the ed@@ itable output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / Str@@ g @-@ up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / C@@ trl @-@ up ) , or to the next / previous conflict , even after the manual solve . therefore , there must be differences between solved and un@@ solved conflicts .
to copy the marking in the clip@@ board , select the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this is enabled , automatically copy the clip@@ board automatically . be careful with this option , as you could acci@@ d@@ ently over@@ write the content of the clip@@ board .
line @-@ files are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line @-@ in characters \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use car @-@ back insert \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps the line @-@ up of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically and restored to the next start . ( menu setting un@@ gen@@ - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a script with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides scripts with variable width to choose , but you should not use it . )
if you tick this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the selected script does not support this image , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in its pure form , but would be rot@@ ated . on these systems the button def@@ aults automatically creates an un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented colour .
when this option is enabled , the tab@@ ulator button will be inserted by the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted .
if you press input or return , the rec@@ alling line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . manually copy the clip@@ board into the clip@@ board .
you can select which Ze@@ il@@ en@@ ende type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
with the compar@@ isons of files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters may be ignored . the second step compar@@ es white characters . in this step , white characters will not be ignored . even when mer@@ ging white signs will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a car @-@ back slot &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , but then you could save files with different sizes in page @-@ on @-@ side comparison , but if this option is activated , but if this option is enabled , this option must be disabled . in default , this option is disabled .
by default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related characters are ignored ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; ) . in the result the differences are displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
by default , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated as changes in white characters .
inten@@ sively still looking for smaller differences . the option is activated by default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow to very large files .
as long as the result of the selection is shown , as long as the result of the selection is displayed , this setting will navigate .
solve automatic all conflicts in white characters as used by the selected file as source . ( default setting is useful if the automatic selection also includes conflicts in numbers or comments , if the automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments , when the options are ignor@@ ing or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments are enabled .
these options are treated in the chapter to scan the folders and exec@@ uting a merge . look for details under documentation to directory and merge tracking .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version exists the suff@@ ix . original file , if already a backup file with the suff@@ ix is original , it will be deleted without further backup .
fits the language of the user interface . change this option does not affect the current running program . you must finish and restart the current program . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is controlled globally through the control centre . )
the following coding settings can be configured separately for each entry . if one enabled this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
over the selection fields for encoding appears a short note what the local coding is . ( this can not be modified and has for you purely informative character . )
customize the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted ; since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which coding is to be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processing commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the default application command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the coding of output of front @-@ processing commands .
switch off this to supp@@ ress her@@ esy changes in white characters in text or reviews . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments are activated . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , you &apos;ll see only the differences between two of three files . according to the selection of A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will be displayed next to the normal or second over@@ sight column with the required information .
sometimes you &apos;d like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just take the less important window . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
arrange the compar@@ ative windows side by side or other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and decides suddenly to bring the files together . a simple click starts to merge the file , and uses the file name of the last source file as the default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart again , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file it is handed over to this external command first . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor , which is exactly your needs . for example , you can use this function e.g. to remove dam@@ aging parts or to correct de@@ pressing .
when reading a file it is handed over to this external command first . if there is a default application command , the output of the command will only write to the default processor , which corresponds to your own pre@@ processor , which corresponds to your needs . each input line must have an appropriate output line .
the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users wish to program that . good news is that , in most cases , sed or per@@ l suff@@ ice perfectly .
use this default application command for line input to convert the input to upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;@@ S / \ \ U \ \ \ . * \ \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ \ . \ \ U . \ \ U contains the found text in the first string . the \ \ U converts the found text into upper@@ case letters .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically add value chains ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word subst@@ itution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you can experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may like these regular expres@@ sions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually a already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further processing command for line @-@ equal . sed &quot; s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every character between &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and any hits will be replaced by nothing , so it is virtually deleted .
sometimes you may want to perform multiple changes at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; you can separate the compositions of each other . example :
instead of used you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e -@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; Ho@@ wever , if used \ \ ( and \ \ ) still needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal Pre@@ processor are used for viewing and keeping together . the further operations only change the data that the Ze@@ il@@ en@@ ab@@ al@@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus looks .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal Pre@@ processor , the Ze@@ il@@ en@@ ab@@ is processor @-@ processor is the output of the normal Pre@@ processor .
the pre@@ processors commands are very useful , but as with each function , the lyrics are altered or differences , you may acci@@ dentally find specific differences in the worst case .
often , program@@ mers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . this is why you can compare and merge all folders with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ;
... makes for each object a proposal for mer@@ ging ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate the coll@@ ision and displays the sim@@ ulated changes without it really perform ,
... taking selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or just with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and merge of individual files . you only need to specify folder on the command line or in the dialog .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a basis . if no target folder was specified , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folders .
note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , not to merge . to merge the merge , select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details will follow . )
while reading the folder you will inform you a small news window about current progress . if you cancel the folder , only the files are listed until then .
if the scan of the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a single mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded down . you can click a folder by double clicking on the + / - or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . all sub@@ directories can open and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open up or open all the folder .
if you double click a file , the file will be started and a compar@@ ative window appears .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folder , it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case the inter@@ n@@ ent action can not be selected automatically , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as shown in the above picture , the colors are red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
with identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered identical if you are identical to all of the content . then also folder is the same color . by Fol@@ ders the age is in@@ significant for its colour .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ ti@@ ff . the colours reflect the colours of a sheet , which is only green , then yellow becomes red and later , when it is old , red becomes red .
... A and C identical , but not B : copying B ( or B not exists , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copying A ( or if A does not exist , if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same dat@@ at@@ ype ( e.g. if a file and B is one file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ts exist , the interaction can not be started .
... A and B not have the same dat@@ at@@ ype ( e.g. if a folder and B is one file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ts exist , the interaction can not be started .
mode for synchron@@ ising is active when only two folders and no explic@@ it target folders are specified and if the option folders are synchron@@ ized . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not the same are : conver@@ ging and save the result into both folders . ( the user can see only the visible file name for the output file only B ; copied directly after the merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and the option new file will be merged instead of merge ( un@@ certain ) then checked &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; but if the files are different , but the date will be different , but the date is identical .. As long as such errors are not removed , the folders cannot be rest@@ art@@ ed .
while exec@@ uting a file after the other , you will show a file after another , and the merge operation has been completed , and according to other messages , if any unexpected review is completed , you should make a final review , and review whether the status is ok everywhere .
if in the setup dialog , the file comparison method is selected , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number un@@ resolved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ dered conflicts will only appear when three folders are compared or merged . )
you may either carry out the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the Plug @-@ in actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merge .
please note : if you do not have a target folder , then the three @-@ folder merge mode is used for the two @-@ folder merge , B and / or B will be used for synchron@@ izing A and / or B folder .
if you chose a target folder , please check that all entries will be displayed in the folder structure as well . there are some options supported by certain entries . verify these options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises :
to perform all entries , select directory entries / proceed in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut abbrevi@@ ation ) . to execute just the current entry : select Action from the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if any conflic@@ ting data types still exist invalid , a message appears indic@@ ating the faul@@ ts of faulty elements . you can then select a valid promotion .
if you merge all entries , a dialog box will lead to options , ejac@@ ulate and break .
if you would like to see what would happen without the real changes , then you will receive an exhau@@ st@@ ive list of all actions .
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , a merge window will open ( note the screenshot ) .
when you are finished with a file , choose / continue directory re@@ sign@@ ment or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on an error , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages which will help you try to trigger the cause of the problem or solve the problem in another way before you proceed to merge .
if some entries have been custom@@ ised individually , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and performs it in later . even if the merge operation has been recorded or not saved , these entries will be performed as required . only if you modify the merge operation , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ) now has a section called directory @-@ merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate plac@@ eholders are displayed with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholder * &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folder must not correspond to this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern , are not displayed in the element tree . it can be used more than a pattern . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern , are not displayed in the element tree . it can be used more than a pattern . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
ignore files that are also ignored by CVS . many autonomous files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other file systems , a leading point is marked as a file . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be shown in the element tree or not . this option is switched on in the default .
when the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files will be compared to which the links are shown . this is disabled by default .
if the option is disabled , the symbolic links are compared , if the option is switched off , the links will be handled and recur@@ sively asser@@ ted . ( note that if the option is switched on ) , the links may lead to itself . ( note that this option is switched off and de@@ pl@@ 3 ; ) This option is disabled by default .
a complete analysis of each file carries out and shows the statistics columns . ( the number of dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( type a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster to compare the change date and the file size . please take a certain level of security . please be careful with caution . this option is to@@ g@@ gled in default .
similarly , no real comparison takes place . the files are considered to be the same if they are equally large . this option can be useful when copying the change date . please be careful with caution . this option is to@@ g@@ gled in default .
&quot; &quot; &quot; activ@@ ating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Synchron@@ ize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode , when two folders are compared and no target folder will be selected . the results of the merge will be stored in both folders . this option is disabled by default . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if there are differences , instead of merge copying the newer file as an action , the knowing that the other file will not be changed . you should check this in any case . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder will be changed or deleted , the original version will be renamed . if an old backup file exists with the .@@ original extension , it will also be replaced without any other backup . this option applies to single files , not only the merge of files . this option is enabled by default .
normally , the folders conver@@ ge are visible to the merge of individual files ; you can switch the window divider using the mouse . if you do not want , you can switch the window in the window menu and switch between the two views of the window and text window .
probably you prefer to compare a file easily by double @-@ clicking , but if you want to launch a single file in the directory , without having to save the folder , the file will be set to refund and the file will not be merged again when you launch the folder .
the status of this status is lost , however , when you start reading the directory : menu -@@ Menu : new
K@@ DE provides network transparency with the help of K@@ IO @-@ slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , which are based on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
a path can be relatively m@@ und@@ . or .. included . that is not possible with URLs , they are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , vac@@ an@@ cies &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # die URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes , due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it can not be distinguished if a link to a file or folder shows . then a file as a link target will always be accepted . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) .
there is no way to process the per@@ missions or change date . hence the per@@ missions or change date from the original . ( note that the option is confi@@ dential . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op first always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a part , collects &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file will exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch patch will start to recover the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can click a patch file and select from the context menu preview to - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . also , it is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the generation of the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . to merge or the compar@@ ing folders is not supported in the K@@ part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now he@@ ist ) is already available . in addition , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 shows that it can result in like the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I use GPL programs for a long time and have learned a lot while I looked into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all program@@ mers that have gone to this way or go so .
you have compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure script to the correct pre@@ fix / us@@ r / local but then K@@ DE can not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not the same . i@@ F commands to next to each other , this is the case .
the editor is noticeable for each difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . this important information is lost when the result is simply saved by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C , it is too much effort to design extra a own file format that might save this information .
the effort was so far too great . you can restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit a large quantity of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text comes suddenly ; No sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text can &apos;t be removed . what does this mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use already many colors to emphas@@ ize differences . even more emphasis is conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and fault reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
in order to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
you can find a list of recent changes under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
um &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE gives you the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are uns@@ ure you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
as &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ aker use , you should not have problems with comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties are encounter@@ ed , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists .
cut out the text clip@@ board ( Str@@ g @-@ X or switching ) into the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert the text from the clip@@ board to the current cur@@ ricul@@ um and replaces the current marking .
only differences : files that are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version you have to re@@ read the folder when updating this options . )
only entries are displayed , the differences are displayed . if the target folder already contains these files , they are missing in the target folder . ( the behaviour will probably be modified in a later version ) , this option is disabled by default .
note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if the lines are already present ) , when the lines are already present , click the button accordingly .
this option is disabled by default . under@@ shoot in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white signs .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . displays a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to change the running programs to change their size to stop them or move them . this works both inside a desktop and several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as those running applications . applications can be selected and even be moved on the desktop and to another .
the middle button of the button can be moved inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . the motion is possible both inside and as well as other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on : if it is clicked on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; click on the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries to minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , Desktop and finish . the following commands make the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . appears only if it is clicked on an application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears if it is clicked on an application .
if the check box is marked , windows can be moved within the &amp; p@@ ager ; s with the middle button of the mouse on the desktop and also to other work areas .
when this field is crossed , in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager are displayed ; the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
check@@ ers of this field lets the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is crossed with name , the names with file numbers will be provided , &amp; eg ; 1st place .
when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in the &amp; p@@ ager .
when this field is crossed , the running programs will be displayed as small windows in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . otherwise only the empty areas are displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple rect@@ angle with the propor@@ tions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its standard icon and Pix@@ map showing a small view of the real program window . re@@ mark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here can be the arrangement of the &amp; p@@ ager ; the main window will be displayed : classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ p@@ ush@@ button appears , as from P@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; Horizont@@ al shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal row , which is very well suitable for presentation on the side of the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display windows as symbols or by their content . it also runs outside the control bar .
right click on the right button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . you can set up to@@ ggle switches ... allowing the dialog to appear .
at the moment this cannot be changed in dialog , but you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. If you have no write permission for the file you need to register as user root or assign to your system administrator . in this file you have to assign the key to wind@@ ow@@ Transpar@@ ent@@ Mode and assign it to this file . possible values are :

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen @-@ screen . you can use with &amp; k@@ mag ; you can use a magni@@ fying glass frame for different users . this application is interesting for various users : these include artist , web designer and people with a visionary view . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly being expanded to include new functions . it is optimised for use on powerful computers .
if you are looking for &amp; k@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of the screen appears . in the following this window appears as a magni@@ fier window . in the following this window appears as a magni@@ fier window , is an enlarged portion of the screen and is described below as a selection window .
in the default setting , it expands ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter is like a moving magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can use &amp; k@@ mag ; to show a selected screen area in the larger screen ( drop screen mode ) or surroundings of the mouse pointing at the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse poin@@ ter in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter , please select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that the mouse is not able to recognize the form of the mouse . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse poin@@ ter .
in the drop mode you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse cursor in the magni@@ fied window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can catch the contents of the magni@@ fying window and move it . this also comes with the arrow keys .
if you are in addition the Shift key , press , or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window will remain ste@@ ady and only the bottom right corner is to move .
&amp; you may have a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer to copy it into a file to insert it in other applications ( to add it to other applications ) , turn the image and much more .
starts or stops the update . stopping the update causes that the CPU time needed against 0 .
select the update rate ( very low , low , medium , h@@ yo@@ ke , very high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is required .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same place as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter was waiting for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people that suffer from RS@@ I syndrome ( Rep@@ et@@ itive Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and which each mouse click pain@@ s .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot when the mouse poin@@ ter is waiting for a while at the same place . it &apos;s meant to help people that em@@ ulate the Rep@@ et@@ itive Stra@@ in In@@ jury . besides , it may em@@ ulate the pulling with your mouse . this requires a little exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can overcome the pain that comes when clicking the mouse and helps to use the computer without any pain . unfortunately , you can also consult a doctor if you are using your computer , if this is not yet done .
to do it once more : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain is caused by clicking with the mouse , it &apos;s against pain , which is caused by moving the mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all ergonomic aids : the result can drop for each different .
using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; che@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and guides a mouse click once you inter@@ rupt the movement .
if the intelligent move is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break when pressing the mouse button inv@@ oked . in this way , you can run the drag of pressed mouse button . in this way , you can run the drag of pressed mouse button . in this way you can get used to make a little exercise , but you get used to it quickly .
this we@@ aving time must stop after the end of the mouse motion before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; click a mouse click .
is Intel@@ li@@ gent@@ es moving on , the film is shut down ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after supp@@ ress the mouse button wait before it starts again , when the mouse has been stopped .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now this function is activated by clicking on the right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow map is stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can later be changed .
when the sound appears delayed , you can go &amp; k@@ de ; to do the response time , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select sound system and here the tab General . there is a slide @-@ off sound buffer that you can adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times .
if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be started at any start by &amp; k@@ de ; at present , this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation for Rate to find out how to launch a program automatically .
set all settings back to values that have been set when opening the dialog . have already pushed the button Apply button , the settings will be reset to the last pressing of user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , smart shift should be switched off at first . if you get used to automatic mouse click you can later increase the smart move .
if you are using the audible click , it is necessary to reduce response times from &amp; k@@ de ; with sounds .
first of all , you should be aware of what places will be a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or places in the browser window , which does not provide a link , will not leave the mouse in such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse is ck@@ oned , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that contact the mouse ball .
first , you need to remove the mouse ball . like this happens , mouse to mouse is different . but it should be clear if you notice the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the Loch@@ es , into which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can easily scra@@ pe them with a flat blade or the fing@@ ern@@ ails .
in very rare situations the operating system crash@@ es the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just started a move process , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by the slogan of the mouse button .
this happens when you &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you can carry out a mouse click . this is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can work as usual .
problem : if you type text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and move the cursor to another point .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there , where you want to place it . but use the mouse on a neutral field of mind if you want to retrieve a key input lag . safe zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray surfaces around the tool@@ bars and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with the clever move , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text .
intelligent comp@@ art@@ ing is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you avoid it . it is very likely to move it into this way to move it into the clip@@ board or use any other action in which you might need to make the mouse with pressed mouse button . but here are some advice about it :
do not use the smart move , if you just start to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; select text instead as follows : perform at an end of the text area a mouse click and hold the Shift key at the other end of the text , and then press the mouse button again .
use the audible cue point . this is by pressing a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the smart move starts . later , you can use the smart move without the audible mouse click . but it requires some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X window ; it should be installed on most systems already .
the functionality of the audible cue point is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker , and this is correct .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is dist@@ orted shortly . this program was developed for people who suffer from RS@@ I syndrome and to which the weak@@ est of the mo@@ ist pain is prepared .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that it starts a particular time that starts a pulling process before the mouse button starts . in this way you can also pull the Drag and Put with the mouse .

&amp; mouth mouth ; is a program where bl@@ unt users can let their computers speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; can &apos;t be able to let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list of these phr@@ ases that are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screenshot ) type a command which is used later for the voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text pass@@ code . you can often select the passages of text , without typ@@ ing them . the passages of text can be processed naturally .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary of Wor@@ ter@@ rap@@ ins . &amp; mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each phr@@ ase . in addition , you can read the word lists with an Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only true characters may be recorded in the wording of the wording .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and essentially includes an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screenshot ) and a memory memory of the previously spoken phr@@ ases ( the upper white field in the screenshot ) .
if you &apos;re k@@ mouth ; you can enter the phr@@ ases you are in input field , which you want to hear . any distinct proposition is attached to the memory memory . they can select from these sets which are to be spoken again .
set up with the menu entry Ad@@ mouth ; set up the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two maps , speech output and settings page , the page wording or the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the command field of the map output , enter the command to enter the language generator . in the box below the input field , insert the character encoding using the text to the language generator .
&amp; mouth ; knows two ways to share the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is distributed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation on your language generator . see examples for this .
with as a language service you will use &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , further settings will be available on this page , and that is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the option of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box action after choosing a text passage you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the Text passage book or in the box for text pass@@ a@@ ars .
in addition to the selection of Instant Mess@@ ages , the selected text passage is directly inserted , in addition to the selection of items , the selected text passage is initially only entered in the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down window in the window fitting window , you can specify if the text file name is automatically stored when closing the window window .
with the selection of text matching files , the book is stored . if you select changes , the textbook is not stored , ask , ask , if the text pass@@ code is to be saved .
the page wording contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the wording of the wording . in the main window next to the input field , shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection field you can choose the currently used dictionary .
with buttons right on the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the sequence of books or export them into a file . below the list you can select the language for the dictionary .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; mouth ; read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of each word is easily determined by counting the report . in addition , you can easily compare the word list with an Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to read only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge all of the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are combined , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
this option allows you to create a blank dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new entered words automatically add into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your voc@@ abulary in the course of time .
the main area of the window to edit text pass@@ age@@ views is two . in the upper part , the strings are displayed as a tree structure .
in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have chosen a text passage , you can change passage or the corresponding short@@ cut . if you choose a text passage book , you can only change its name .
actions like to add new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either via the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text pass@@ ers or text passages you can change through drag with your mouse to the new location or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut and copied into the clip@@ board . if an input table is selected , the selected ranges will be used , otherwise the selected ranges will be used .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if an input table is selected in the input field , it is used to select the selected ranges of the engine file .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if the text is in an input field , it is used to select the selected pro@@ positions of the engine file .
if this menu entry is crossed with buttons for frequently used commands , the tool bar is arranged by default via the menu bar . by clicking on the smart left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another point .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow glue in the lower part of the main window with hints concerning the condition of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this stat@@ us@@ bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar is displayed by entries with entries . the bar is arranged by default via the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the smart left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another point .
probably you have entered the command for the voice output not properly or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; open the page General settings and specify the command for voice output on the map card . ( see Settings dialog for voice synchron@@ iz@@ ers to further details . )
Festival is a speech @-@ edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows to use festival for free and further spread without restrictions .
in order to show an example of command line for setting the speech output , it is assumed that Festival is installed in the / us@@ r / local / Festival . the command to speech is :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator which is written in &amp; Java . currently it supports only the English language . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and further spread without restrictions .
in order to show an example of command line for specif@@ ying speech output , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / us@@ r / local / fre@@ eb@@ ox . the speech output is then possible with one of the three following examples :
for the third example , the option should be switched on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of Free@@ T@@ TS application . )
M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to remove the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text to phon@@ em@@ es for M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , assum@@ ing that H@@ adi@@ fax and M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / us@@ r / local / hadi@@ fax and / us@@ r / local / mb@@ ro@@ la .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is the last sign of the text , so that an additional sign needs to be added . the complete command is therefore more complex than in the other examples :
( Cat . ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / us@@ r / local / removable / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ / mp@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o / us@@ r / local / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option to send data as standard input must be switched on .
the speech @-@ dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ on language service which is available to all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice @-@ output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . he uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since setting up the language generator only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a language service in &amp; mouth ;
for setting use the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service which appears in the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and naturally &amp; k@@ de ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; takes about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on the details of your computer and configuration .
&amp; mouth ; is an application that can &apos;t speak with the people who cannot speak , Text through the calcul@@ ator . it will be a list already scanned sets which can be re @-@ used for users repeatedly .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth does not include voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . on the computer you have to be a voice syn@@ thesizer .

&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the speech output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service , which allows any application to read text via the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a part system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; program@@ mers ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS capabilities . also , users can offer interesting options .
reading texts ( or parts of it ) in the text editor &amp; Kate ; also if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications embedded .
the speech output is carried out via the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , the different background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows production of language expend@@ itu@@ res on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ relief programme .
Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for speech @-@ up languages like Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Speech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Speech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Meta @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the voice @-@ over@@ s of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without any visible window , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers .
a application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and configuration of kt@@ ts@@ d on t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr into the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts on a web page or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; Kate ; where a text file can be read entirely or partially .

before you can , use the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher to install and properly set . see also
at the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the flash@@ card printer is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the flash@@ card General is displayed .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer various languages and voices , so also various male or female , or such that are defined in volume or speed . you should also set up several variants for one syn@@ thesizer before you can use at least one speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; because the speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is used otherwise the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer sp@@ ans for the same printer .
when you click on the flash@@ cards speaker in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the flash@@ card speaker is displayed . this will also be displayed automatically , if you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and yet no radio is set up .
all speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the list . the top speaker is used for voice @-@ over@@ s when an application does not exist .

with a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change settings . see below .
select a mouse click on the list with a mouse click on this button , and click on this button to move the speaker on the list below . the order of speakers in the list also determines its priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; hec@@ tac@@ tical system .
select a type of voice here , three male and three female voices , as well as a woman &apos;s voice .
if you click here , the new speaker on the box map will appear . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can already use it . go back to the Map General and check if the T@@ TS service is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the map files to create and manage text entries . see below .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the spe@@ e@@ ship system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the map tab@@ s General to open this map card . here you can set some general options .
check this check box to activate the &amp; PC . if this start is successful , the map files will be displayed and you can read text orders and read . see . please remove the marking , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and start the T@@ TS System by &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
when a t@@ sm@@ gr is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue , if the field is checked ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is labeled and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears , when reading is in the Control Unit , it appears again , once the reading is complete .
with buttons in this series you can start text contracts , stop , stop and hold back .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board can be read or write a text file to preview . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages .

filters are one of the advanced features of business . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts , filters are not required .
in filters text is processed before it is sent to the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improvement of pron@@ unci@@ ation , to select a suitable language and nar@@ ration , or to avoid a suitable language and nar@@ rator or to avoid certain defects of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four kinds of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be submitted to all other expenses and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is pre @-@ read , the requested orders will be continued again .
war@@ nings received the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is getting too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and regular text . these jobs will continue after the output of the warning again .
News , the next lower priority . a message is interrup@@ ting normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that occurs on a web page . while you &amp; eg ; you can welcome a long text on a web page . &amp; k@@ mouth ; find someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ mouth ; al@@ erts are also messages . read about that .
the rest are simple text contracts . each order you encounter orders from the map is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text contracts . text orders are intended for the issue longer texts that do not have special ur@@ gency .
all four commis@@ sions are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just a copy of the screen will stop and termin@@ ate .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages , and text contracts as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter process the text and pass it next to the next filters . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there will be more types of filters .
replacement parts replacing a text by other text . the replacement parts can be supplied as words or as regular expres@@ sions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is supplied with pre@@ defined string hooks , such as : - ) by text or for conversion of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; K@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Tran@@ smit@@ ter uses an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ) to convert &amp; XML to convert from a format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with spokes@@ woman fil@@ tering , you can send jobs depending on the text of the text , or depending on the program that sent the text to you ; if you have submitted a female voice on the map card , you can read text from K@@ DE messages above . read more .
each of these various filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to voice output . if the filter appears that his rules are not valid , it keeps the text in the next fil@@ tering .
when a text order , a warning , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ reporting on &amp; kt@@ ts , it is processed by all the activated filters selected on the page below . the processing by the filter takes place in the order from top to bottom .
this displays the list of the included standard filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from the top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of the filter , and it will be displayed below the following setup dial@@ ogs .
for the set of string filters you must type a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as compar@@ ative patterns . if this pattern is found in the text , the text is exchanged for the associated replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . this name can be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily , it has to differ only from the name of the other filters .
this is the list of the words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the character strings in accordance and replace it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is displayed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom .
click here to shift the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can download a list of words or regular expres@@ sions of a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries are attached to the existing list .
here is a language registered , the filter is only applied when the speaker is spoken for the text order one of the languages registered here . you can also select multiple languages , when pressing the &amp; C@@ trl + key when pressing the mouse button .
here is a value registered here , the filter will only be applied if the text is specified by one of the specified applications . you can submit several programs separated by Com@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , K@@ mail
the user ID of running programs can be used with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Num@@ bers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID Cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 must be entered .
the filter replacement filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box di@@ visible filters apply when all input fields are empty , the filter becomes applied to all texts .
in comparison of words , the string maintenance filter uses regular expres@@ sions in the \ \ s word \ \ s word \ \ s word . so the words must be limited on both sides .
in this manual you will find no guide to writing regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; check it in the package .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; style Language - trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such de@@ form@@ ations . but it can only be applied to well @-@ shaped XML . the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the speaker menu , you can send texts to a certain speaker , which is set up on the map card , or to a speaker with certain traits . for example , you can define that texts by K@@ Mail are to be read by a female voice . behold .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter passes , there is a speaker for the lyrics . the speaker is refer@@ enced from the subject matter which gives the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the properties of the speaker &apos;s card nar@@ rator can send the chosen speaker .
if the filter is set here , the filter appears in case the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; pre@@ press , you can use this one click on the button to get help when typ@@ ing .
in order to achieve faster workmanship , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
set the properties of the required speaker here . if the text meets the filter conditions above , the speaker will be selected according to the required requirements on the e@@ he@@ st . click on the button to view the dialog box .
use these buttons to store or load or delete all settings .
the speaker is only applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box di@@ ets filter apply when apply . you must apply at least one condition .

none of the mentioned language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ converting filter , but when using the module for festival pages , web pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone so that SA@@ BLE is not working at all . you can then do that if you don &apos;t have this voice to read from websites . please ensure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c has to be found and about the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain signs or patterns appear to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers so whole sentences ski@@ pped or only che@@ w@@ avy are output . what can I do against it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , make sure that the option sign signi@@ fies the correct value for the corresponding language . is there any problems with certain signs or words , they may be solved by a string drag filter . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , which are used by &amp; kt@@ ts , have their own license which you will find in the associated documentation or on the relevant websites . there are also voices that own a own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE code archive , you can download the k@@ de@@ acc@@ essibility package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can also find the source code of k@@ de@@ acc@@ essibility under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de .
includes many languages , a list of all currently supported languages on the project page htt@@ p : / / Nor@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ wah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ d .
KT@@ TS also works with any language syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a console .
the list of the above languages can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , consider the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . also look at the web page . , according to information that are not yet included in this manual .
the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for using another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , please contact the developer team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is used but not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages of k@@ deli@@ bs and the developer files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you refer to the source texts of &amp; kt@@ ts ; refer to the source code for k@@ de@@ acc@@ essibility or downloaded the Tar@@ ball at the latest , and install the program with the following commands :
before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first if speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your language syn@@ thesizer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; which is to be developed by speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . the programme kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be further developed and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is not needed anymore .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual sentences . the user can rep@@ ay Sat@@ z@@ or or altern@@ ate , repeat the output or inter@@ rupt the output .
if a application text on &amp; kt@@ ts is given , you can choose the properties of the preferred speaker for the issue , for example , if you have created a speaker , whose language English and its gender is used , otherwise the best matching or@@ ator will be chosen . if you want to learn more about this , you will see a speaker . if you want to read more about it , you will see a speaker .
after clicking on the map card , you can click on the map or click Edit , the map card printer is displayed . for example , the display of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below .
enter the path for exec@@ utable festival program . if the path is included in the PAT@@ H path , you only need to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text , which will be handed over to the festival . by voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts , this setting will automatically be applied , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak , ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ der , you adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you do not select some controllers and display this gray , the chosen voice doesn &apos;t allow you to match these settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices will need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you check this check box , these voices are already loaded by the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized on the first set .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet opened a speaker ( or click on users click ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box is marked , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dig@@ t@@ sm@@ gr &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; window appears on the starting point . otherwise , after the launch , only the icon in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr it is not running , it appears in the system area as soon as the TT@@ SD is reading a text . thus , you have the possibility to stop or control elsewhere .
here are all the orders placed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that the order submitted to the current status of the order , the number of pro@@ positions and the just edited set . the speakers ID corresponds to the ID on the map card spokes@@ man .
with the buttons in this series you can substitute a meditation on the behalf that is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) .
with a click on OK , all the changes to the settings ( also on the other map cards ) will be revers@@ ed on the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
here only text entries will be performed and managed . issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and News are not displayed . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the appropriate audio module , compiled or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is used for the audio output , select here the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must select at least one module . select the PCM device here . see also
set the microphone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % is corresponding to the half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % of the usual normal speed of communication . to allow these settings to be implemented , the program must be ne@@ x installed .
click Apply to Apply to the new settings for the ongoing business cycle ; -@@ System .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all the PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out what device works with you . in case of doubt , choose Standard .
this map card allows you to set up special actions , which will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders :
the issu@@ ance of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be drawn to all other expenses and has received these orders . after the output of the screen reader was read , the requested orders will be resumed .
war@@ nings received the next lower priority level . this stage is important news like &amp; eg ; processor becomes too hot . a warning will keep the issue of messages and regular text . these jobs will continue after reading the warning again .
News have the next priority . a message is interrup@@ ting normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read messages . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome to enter the room .
getting a text contract by a message , warning or the output of a screen @-@ reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output is queu@@ ed on the queu@@ e .
this audio file is always played when a normal word order is interrupted when exec@@ uting sound as well as an introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map apply only for normal amounts of text . for messages , war@@ nings , and issues of screen @-@ re@@ a@@ es there are no particular actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; read on Not@@ ification news , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click on al@@ erts . the map message appears .
check this check box to disable the reading from &amp; k@@ de ; if this setting is not marked , the other settings are disabled and does not read messages ; reads no not@@ if@@ ications .
if this setting is marked , al@@ erts , where a sound is played , is read by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to list .
this event reads the message indic@@ ating &amp; conversation ; sent when someone is mentioned in a IR@@ C message your nickname .
all events , for which is otherwise stated in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ;
use this selection panel to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; to do , if an event occurs . you have the following sel@@ ections :
if you have selected some user defined text , enter the required text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . standard select the speaker , which is displayed as top entry in the list on the map card . see also .
note that there are three planes for events . if a certain event is specified for a certain application , it will run . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . as the last possibility , the action has been specified by default ( all other events ) .
the event all not@@ if@@ ications for application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can specify the not@@ if@@ ications as follows :
use the button Save to store the settings for the messages to a file . loaded events will start with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Un@@ delete all entries except All Not@@ ices will be deleted .
the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains stamps for the control of voices , the speech speed , the sex of the voice and the pitch . the SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , a further W@@ 3C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are present :
you must install the Rab _ di@@ phone vote ( British male ) since this is the default voice to the festival in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or sound in the Festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , the SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ in spoken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / / W@@ 3C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / / W@@ 3C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / / W@@ 3C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked mom Bear . who was sleeping in my bed ? asked the bear . &#93; &#93; &gt; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and sat@@ z@@ limit@@ ing filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . therefore , the first set may be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order . thus you can also stop or stop on the cardboard card or stop or cancel , even if the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers not directly support this directly .
here you see the pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically add a set @-@ limit@@ ing filter . you can change the settings or add another proposition filter , but beginners will not gr@@ ate them .
the easiest way to test the audio selection by selecting . please switch on the map selection , which speakers &amp; tec@@ s to select , select some properties and check how the selection of the speaker has changed . of course you must have set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster with reading can begin , since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can then stop or cancel the text on the map card , even if the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers do not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal pro@@ limit@@ ing filter is automatically set up for the first time . it can not switch off , only removed . change nothing at this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
text @-@ limit@@ ing filters compare with a regular expression for pro@@ positi@@ onal and add a t@@ onal sign ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ positi@@ onal limits ( tab character automatically removed from the text ) . note that the Standard @-@ Sat@@ z@@ limit@@ ing filter keeps the animation .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( sound ) , war@@ nings , messages , or the output of Screen Re@@ aders .
if you &apos;re looking for a normal pro@@ positi@@ onal filter removed , you can re@@ paste it by charging the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file .

check this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set multiple markers here .
since the language is a critical factor in the understanding of the output , this property will rarely use as a priority attribute . the only case you might want to specify the attribute language is provided , if you know that a certain application text is sent in another language than that of the work environment .
to use all properties in the field of speakers which corresponds to the nearest to the following , use the standard speaker , and then apply to actors that corresponds to the following .

this guide explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ net@@ l@@ center ; which allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows users to manage a range of system and desktop settings through a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the user :
after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be accessed by selecting the k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in the &amp; k@@ menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install , physical devices and their drivers must have already fully installed and configured it , with that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device itself shows and setting the network properties .
in most cases drivers will be installed for the network hardware and other devices when installing and set up computers . network appliances will be added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the Network Settings module will be charged if the option is selected at the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; when starting the module network settings this , the platform used on the system will be automatically recognized .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to select which the distribution and the release and the release can be made permanently . by setting the network settings this option is automatically pre @-@ set .
changing network settings are only possible in system administration mode . before , all options are displayed grey , which means the settings can only be considered , modi@@ fying the system administration mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
the entire functionality of the module is available in the system administration mode . it is divided into three riders :
the tab Network interfaces can be used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices will be displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the tab Network interfaces :
set the settings for network interfaces by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... in the dialog unit setup .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available , click the dialog with Advanced Options dialog .
with the automatic selection , TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the DH@@ CP / BO@@ O@@ TP server will be compatible with any system start@@ up , therefore either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server can be selected according to the system .
with the manual , without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , TCP / IP configuration can be specified . in the input field IP address the required TCP / IP address must be specified . the sub@@ net mask must be specified in the input field .
if this setting is selected , the system is initi@@ alizing network interface while bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the unit box .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering a existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping into the &amp; console ; you can tell whether the requested address is already used . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be enabled or switched on , if required . switch on a network device by selecting from the list and clicking the interface ...
network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on the need . turn off by selecting the interface by selecting from the list and clicking the interface ...
defines the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface available , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain registration by the appropriate IP address . if computers can only understand IP addresses , DNS suff@@ ers this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the calcul@@ ator to the name resolution part of the rider name resolution allows for easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNS entries can be added or converted to the list by selecting a request and up or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by clicking the button adding ... a DNS server can be added to a name resolution . it will add a dialog to the New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group computer to name resolution , select an entry and click on the button .... It will edit the Edit dialog .
the list of name @-@ known machine describes machine name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily for bo@@ oting , if no DNS server is available . in small , un@@ locked networks , it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the list of name commonly known hosts contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some specific IPv6 addresses may still support . this version of IP is to be replaced in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add .... The New dialog window will be shown .
enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and add the add . if the well @-@ known machine has several alias name , de button add several times and enter the further alias name .
select an entry of a well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog lab@@ elled box is displayed .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then with clicking on OK the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings made by the module network settings are not immediately available in the system . to activate the changes , the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source .
for installing the binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it simply is the rpm package to download and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with a graphic surface can be used like k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient , but additionally the development packages are required with libraries and other things .
this is only recommended for experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should accomplish this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic networks will be given , in the second all by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changed configuration files are discussed .
this section may not replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endix contains only basic information on the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network .
currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 5 does not have a long distribution . from IPv6 it is expected that it is in the near future . this description is currently focusing on the widespread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is to assign the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; privilege ; Work@@ place is the network administrator to address a valid IP address , or if available , the IP address can not be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network the IP address should be chosen from a specially reserved area to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet , therefore its use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the range of 192.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 through 192.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all machines are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called Standard Route that the Second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . the default route is required for IP for@@ warding .
the app@@ ad@@ ress 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf are affected and where they are disc@@ arded in various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynam@@ ically modified in DSL connection , so it will not be surprised if in the case of active DSL connection , another content is to be found there .
for &amp; SuSE ; is known that this file is sorted alpha@@ be@@ tically through the scripts in the sub @-@ format . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the variable and select Select . verify that the name and value of the variable will be displayed correctly .
if all tasks and environment variables are entered or changed , you still need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . then select the menu item Save .
alternatively , you can add C@@ trl ; S . changes or additions to tasks or variables will only be active .
it appears the standard k@@ de ; if you select the fl@@ aps , you will see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; specific options in the printing dialog .
note the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who own advanced permission .
cr@@ on , for example vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the sched@@ ules of the user .
a PO@@ SIX con@@ forming &amp; UNIX , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first goal was to create a surface for tar , which provided the ability of d@@ ds@@ 2@@ tar for a quick , sel@@ ective pack . the second goal was to reply to a question that made my wife : how much longer does it take ?
before a tape can be used , it must be submitted by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three types :
&amp; dat ; adds the band back and reads the pre@@ ten@@ se information of the belt . recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat ; the band does not know if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the default index looks for the matching index on your record . can not be found if the index index is to be re @-@ created .
everything goes smoothly , the symbol for the tape drives to indicate that the tape is mounted . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched through the fl@@ aps of the entry for the tape .
before e@@ ject the belt , first integration must first be solved . there are three methods to achieve this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; can be seen through a change of symbol for the band , that the inclusion for the band has been resolved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be e@@ jected without any danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ;
a band @-@ type must be format@@ ted before you use to store data . this process does not correspond to form@@ atting with &amp; k@@ dat ; this process has to be format@@ ted before using the tape and does not form@@ atting a tape . floppy drives usually don &apos;t have a form@@ atting of the belt , DA@@ T drives doesn &apos;t work .
after entering the belt name and the capacity , &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the tape . all data on the tape are lost , the tape is automatically mounted and ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you must select the backup files . that can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in local file tree . it &apos;s deleted only this file or folder .
check the safety profile in the tree . only the files entered in the profile are secured .
mark files in local file tree with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu of Sich@@ en@@ ians ...
once the backup has been introduced , the dialog for backup will open . in this dialog you can check once the selected files and change the settings for backup .
when you have confirmed the settings , the backup will change . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
mark a file or folder in one of the archives in entry for the drive . it will be checked only the selected file or folder .
mark the files in one of the archives in the record for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry check .
once the check process has been started , the dialog for checking . in this dialog you can check your selection once and change the file folders for checking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the check , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the audit@@ ing process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before you can create re @-@ produce , the files you are supposed to be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that will be named for the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . only those files and / or sub@@ folders are recovered .
right click with the right mouse button , click a file or folder in one of the archives and select to recover in the menu ....
once the recovery has been started , the dialog for Rest@@ oration . in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the folders for recovery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you have confirmed the settings for the restoration , the dialog will restart . this dialog shows the progress in the recovery and the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the band inde@@ xed file using the band content . this procedure del@@ etes all existing in@@ dex@@ files for this band . you can re@@ build the index to two types of tape :
this will create a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can do the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup should be made . the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the currently selected operating folder .
for all folders that are listed under backup files , the files will be backed up to the same file system such as the folder . folder that are stored on other file systems , you can separately apply to other file systems . each entry will be viewed from others regardless of the other file system files .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have been changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file will be backed up since then .
the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and create a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; files ; files were not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings using the K@@ D@@ at menu option ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be done :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / Tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape .
this setting is active , convey@@ ed &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated into the drive load . for some drives , this is necessary to be performed before reading or write operation .
if the option is switched ON , &amp; k@@ dat ; to block the cast in the tape , this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , when using the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically use the tape . do not use this option with floppy streams .
if the option is switched ON , &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware @-@ file size for the tape drives to change . not all drives support variable block@@ sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must inform &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case you have to share the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a volume is format@@ ted , writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should cover only a memory block on the tape . the file content is composed as follows :
( n byte ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this string is machine name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system , on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds which have been format@@ ted since the era in which the band has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file named with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archive which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work , as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is mounted .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , where you can get information about your system or where the system is stored on the various protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to the example of issues relating to your server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users to understand what makes your computer in the background . is a simplified description of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stored the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log works ; experienced users with quick access , for example , on information about problems that appear on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; tries to provide some advanced functions which can be filtered and analyzed by the protocol files of specific programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . among others include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screenshot shows &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available , using their help to easily fil@@ tering the individual minutes @-@ lines of a protocol file . the individual possibilities for sorting out and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after launching &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first , the main protocol @-@ file of the system - the system Protocol - will open to you , and it opens up instead of its a small message window , so you don &apos;t have to run on system administrator . the protocol files usually doesn &apos;t have access to read these files normally in the folder / var / log , for normal users .
you can also filter the filter bar in order to filter the selected filter bar . the list of the log @-@ lines will now be displayed automatically , so that only a log @-@ string is displayed next to the selected filter . in the default setting , the drop line contains only the default string , if in one of the columns the string search string is contained .
you can also select an other entry in this place of course . for example , select the string search string , and then select the name of a process , and carry you in the filter bar the name of a process , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all the protocol @-@ lines that have been sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled by default and helps you to identify the important minutes lines . minutes @-@ lines of the level errors are displayed with a striking color as protocol @-@ lines of the stage source . the color representation of minutes lines can be disabled .
would you like to display only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , then you can look at the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the process . for example , if you want to inspect the output of a certain command , e.g. to start the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the option to new lines in context menu of the main window to display all new protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate window windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage an additional window . once you have selected a window , select a Protocol to display .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has a dedicated website to htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more current information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and in the following also called names ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section guides a couple of concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the System V In@@ it is rapidly developed for the control of program start @-@ up at the system in the &amp; Linux ; and therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD In@@ it .
I will not continue to take part in historical aspects ( for example because I know nothing about it : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to carry a machine on System V In@@ it without having a re@@ install and re@@ format . that &apos;s why you must make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there , if there was one .
the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are located directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folder :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for each system service which you want to start the system or change to another round . system services do not include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ pd &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things like set@@ serial that is only once started . such views belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie in its part under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something like you have to do something with serial port .
the kernel looks for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one he finds .
the default value is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably determine that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to modify them , then you can fix / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and change the 3 . if you want to have something confused , then you can manually start the system and execute the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder no real files are . instead , every entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how does it start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written that it is a argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts out of hand on the command line :
this would stop the htt@@ pd server . in@@ it reads the name , and when it contains a K , the script will start with the argument stop . if it includes a S , the script will start with the argument starting .
some people wish to set up a simple way of setting machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; privilege ; a server @-@ run only , that can run only htt@@ pd , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; , network &amp; etc ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc . ;
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; you should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another hand device is simple to not say tri@@ vial , simply drag an entry from the field of availability to one of the six rounds to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move the scripts between Run@@ lev@@ eling or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else . this will only happen if you pull one entry from the field of available system services .
note : entries will be post@@ pon@@ ed if you copy them to a new run@@ level , you have to explicitly choose from the Edit menu or select the context menu -- even then , if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of a single entry cannot be calculated at times . in such a case you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attemp@@ ting to add the system service .
note : there is no way to restore entries , which have been thrown into the Recy@@ cle Bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different work areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection out@@ - or below the previous .
to move an entry into another round , move it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl + X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ trl + V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of a single entry manually , press the input button to change the properties dialog . select the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the loss of data loss , all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c , if they are available . otherwise they are saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; they are stored in a local cas@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experiment@@ ing with the standard lap@@ tops , and now the machine is constantly emerging . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in a single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default tune to a reasonable value ( 3 should be fine ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way to start system services in these distri@@ butions , however , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary setup programmes of these distri@@ butions , but does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution please check if all the configuration files are needed ( and also whether they are located in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache htt@@ pd ) simply complete without a message when your configuration files are not available or false .
the meaning of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , even from version to version different . if you are using a different distribution please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual may be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . this program allows you to manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it &apos;s sufficient to start reading the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ;
after you have made changes you have to store it . either you use the corresponding symbol of the tool bar or the entry in the menu file .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , user and user groups . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group features .
some map cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you can adjust the default limitations ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , you will need to install other cards if your shadow passwords or etc / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes .
the ticket card statement will appear if shadow passwords , or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD centers are already installed .
this map card only appears if activated and initi@@ alized for at least one inserted file system space restri@@ ction ( Qu@@ ota ) , and is recogni@@ zable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system . here , the limitations of space may be modified in KB .
these parameters can be set separately for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system will be selected using the field file system .
the map map groups inform about the group belonging to the selected user . the default group to which the user belongs , can be found in the field of Pri@@ m@@ aires . furthermore , the user can be a member in other groups by mark them in the large field .
the dialog &apos;s dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the Group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , select adding the user or group menu or click the matching button of the tool bar . editing or delete the selected group or the selected group will work analogue .
with this module , you can install the L@@ ILO @-@ Boot@@ Manager , remove and modify the boat pass@@ fore@@ word , remove and modify the time to bo@@ oting the standard operating system , remove , remove operating systems , remove , modify , and more .
