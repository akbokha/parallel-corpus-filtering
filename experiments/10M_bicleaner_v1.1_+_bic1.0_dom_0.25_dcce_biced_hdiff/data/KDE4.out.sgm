<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labelled with the different characteristics of the appropriate file or folder. for each property you can specify if enough space is available, or if the area is displayed by subordinate boxes (whereby the area errors are displayed by restrictions on the sign of the Treemap). in addition, you can specify the relative position of the labeling in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In case algorithms for treemaps should be kept, that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & fsview, this goal is not always available, and this frame will not always be available, which is less space for the frame, if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As separation of the surface of a single entry for the subordinate entries, the implementation is provided for labeling and avoidance of space loss by setting the boxes that are possible square. the best methods in this respect are rows, columns or recursive second.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimal space for an entry above the menu entry in the area. instead, a space pattern in the area of the parent's entry is drawn in order to view that this area is covered by an subordinate entry.</seg>

<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location. if you have enough photos, you will then use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then export a folder for pictures you want to print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements like versioning photos, archiving, work processes, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of all. within 10 years will have 95% archives and 5% work files and you will not want to re-organize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes forklifts easier. split new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and workplaces simplifies backup strategy and migration. they will always know if you are looking for an original or derived picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend adding the metadata in the file page of the metadata in & digiplug. if you forget, this ensures that EXIF data and IPTC data can be stored into the file, then you can subsequently select the metadata from the database to select the respective point in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what if you want to change it; them include a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts because you should now select all photos, label and an evaluation. of course you can select all the images that will need the same attribute. this makes sense, as you can concentrate on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now talk with references, keywords, as you are using other programs. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import Catalogised images from another source of embedded boxes, then & digicame; automatically build the tree to the right place. the reversed hierarchy in the tree is no problem and can easily be carried out by the following keywords: updates by & digious; updated while keeping the subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows like different mergeinfo. this is a very rough representation, since each bloc of metadata in truth consists of many sections. file name and calendar data are characteristics of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keyword - the next section refers to labeling or comments, the third important tool for cataloging your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to simply let most anyone know your photos, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="163">Check out this panorama. from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look closer to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandie 60 years after the landing. Wow! you might even have memories, the historical period is again present, you may even listen to the silence. the labeling has changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others viewing your photos, the title might be more important than the picture itself. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is transferred to the viewer to help Him to understand Him about the motive that you can understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">In order if a picture is not perfect, if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digicame; you can use any text in an internationalised Alphabet (UTF-8) as labeling. you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time. KDE will even produce a spell checker at the same time. KDE will also tell you the label chosen for the label and / or title of the Web Galeriesystems. so you have to tell the story for the opening act no second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet before GoogleEarth? well, because with images the train departs the spatial presentation now already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to use the geolocation calls already become countless in the future. I'm sure that one day, you can repeat your travels through pictures with geographic information. you can also export KML files using Google Earth. you can also export the images using Google Earth. you can also export the images to Google on Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word play with copyright and denotes the practice the copyrights to remove any restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information came in the setup page of & digi; as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should add your name or the name of the photographer, for example, if it is not desired, the name of a company or organization can be used. after that, it should not be changed. this field does not support semicmas or semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autonomitel (synonym for author): linked to the author. this field contains the name of the photographer, freelance photographer or independent photographer. as a note to the car field, this field must be completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the vendor field to identify who is offered by the photo. if the photographer has been shown here, these organizations might be listed here. if the picture is shown here, the group / agency will be shown here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they do not have a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator, this, in the picture embedded metadata, can delete or modify the solution to this problem. for private individuals this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digiplug is provided in the near future such a module for forklifts.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record errors, record cut, blackout, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of storage media, recovery, redundancy, desperation prevention, lifetime, data size, widespread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same as you can pass through traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it concerns problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroell Ontrack, the biggest data recovery firm in the world, has some interesting statistics which cause a loss of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, these cautious must be handled and you can no longer buy CDs and DVDs in archiving quality. there are also offers over gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself. whether you believe that lies in your messaging space.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you can use good discos and good recording devices. the best DVD recordings are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you're getting a lot more reliable, so that's why choose the right choice.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to mistakes, even if you are just writing a control mechanism around itself. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for the formatting and the control sums. despite this massive protection they are required for chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there's a cheap program called IsoBuster that works miracles on CDs and DVDs. however, it is still not available for Macs. there are similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disk disks, hard drives, flash drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs appear to capture the format war against HD DVD and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual player DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs, of course also applies to the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-propriate format. if you like to check the media with a description, date & author and then check the data on the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that may read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Diskmanufacturers retain your statistics for themselves. their manufacturing facilities include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study about error mechanisms of hard drives: disflaw study</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly, Disks stay on the longest when you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. with lower temperature figures, errors do not determine the most common cause of trouble. some of SMART fixes the most common cause. this is especially Lesefehler and publishing count. the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This involves the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses are normally produced without big problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices do not make a lot of accounts, it looks different in devices with computer chips and high speed processes. these abnormalities can cause serious damage, hardware and hardware defects. so protect the motherboards and other defects. so protect themselves from the unavoidable which leads to loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against blackheads is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of energy saving. it is normally compensated in the form of a plug-bar. however, remember that not every plug-bar also contains a surge protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you look for an overvoltage protection, you should consider that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this ensures a certain minimum of protection. you should also ensure that it protects the protection against lightning and protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can use to your machine, you should also ensure that all peripherals can be connected to your system. some manufacturers provide overvoltage calls that also contain a phone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity to the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV menu.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable surge protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. thus, you are ideal for traveling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While a overvoltage protection protects your system from smaller variations in the power lines it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of few seconds can result in the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful in an uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Besides the protection against overvoltage, these devices can automatically shut down battery energy if a power outage occurs. some models will even allow them to work even further down to the system. if you have a USV you should be sure that it fulfils the same quality requirements like an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Remember the potential risk of calculating your computer system and compare his security in power problems with the costs to avoid them. this is only a small price difference if you're considering how good your computer is protected. at the end, you should always remember all cables to trample before you go to holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - Simple Storage Service. you can use this as a Drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software. Google shared storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amounts of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, compared to the hard drives at home, however, very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. furthermore, you have to send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore only suited as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is no general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and Photo-Community 23hq.com are available on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures at full resolution online, in case of Flickr dramatically more. for $25 per year you get unlimited storage that should be checked in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">Data protection are very secure from the point of view of data backup. transmission errors are automatically adjusted by the TCP protocols and the big companies offer a backup and a distribution memory. therefore, they are desastersafe.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calculator. all transmissions are prone to transmission errors. the filesystem zfs and btrfs provide at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">Worst of this is that no one says when a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you have been destroyed in your computer. no one seems to have thought about it. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data way than that of your machine.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable networks are a further source of transmission lusts, since they generate interferences within the data streams. with normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not especially affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010, you will see thousands of defects per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle and highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one of the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is available soon for & Linux; and Windows available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms used and is also available for & Linux; but it is still not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss during the notebook and 46% with the workbench systems. Notebooks already the proportion of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most vulnerable ones. currently, there is no harm to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no one has been sighted for many times.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFs, JFS and XFS to give the common file systems. a very good English article can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden period is higher and an undefined status is avoided. if a file is not completely stored before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human mistakes are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">"" "" "" "sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 Blending settings from the fundamental physical limits. it is meant that the technology continues to develop a natural border for this progress. sensitivity and sound characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit." ""</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel cameras. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more orized. even DSLR cameras have their limit in 10-12 megapixels. even DSLR cameras have a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive is currently available for 100 & Euro; so don't make anyone used for data loss. 6% of all PCs are often referred to one plan and test this backup before you might be any dangerous like the reinstallation of your OS, the exchange of boards or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash hit you if the drive was not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster closes locally and destroys a lot. forget plane gap: fire, water, electricity, children and robbery are dangerous enough for your data. they normally concern a whole room or the whole house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, desasterprevention always means a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs to the neighboring house, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as above already mentioned is a common reason for a loss of data despite backup the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files that should be secured. it is a snapshot without histories and represents a complete copy at one time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of files that have been changed since the last complete backup. provides a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differentiation.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup. creates original status at any time again which such a backup was made. this backup is the next one with the exception that it just slipped and not going continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily setup your machine. in contrast to script controlled FTP sites or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only the difference between files that really changed. this happens and if you want to enhance the security of ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or other visual media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach will be enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time, you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. at the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should be done manually, after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC data, affiliate, memory, scalability, media, reproduction of images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable images will survive the next 40 year, that is approximately the time span in which you are really interested in your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable because of your nature, you must consider all that today is going to be treated with caution and evaluate during the time. unfortunately, there are no other way to ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible. the less variations you have in the past are so much easier to evaluate the issues of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered with the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is currently available for everyone. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, then keep it on and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: each time you change your machine architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should review your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the expert pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set the scalability with you and you want to enlarge the area you want. if nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check the dmesg command, if your new record was detected by the system, but hang it in.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / SDC # source is / dev / SDC & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBgt; # works with ext2, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resident / dev / sadmin # change the size of departure if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task becomes easier by year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format disappears slowly from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been designed as an open source standard which should replace the GIF. however, there can be much more. it's more fun, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata and full transparency. PNG can use Gamma- and Chromatic data for an improved colour configuration, but not as many as TIFF and we would like to recommend this format to save your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as an image format. TIFF can store images in uncompressed format or in a container with a lossless compression salt. a problem is, however, that this format is adapted to many people. therefore, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types of cameras.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a license-free and open format format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG is now based on the need to use metadata. a handful camera controller is now available to DNG and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon even sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe its XML based XMP technology introduced to cot the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information is allowed with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored that for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive a copy of your photo, mostly in the shell format, as it stores the metadata separately from the image file and as seen before. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of applications and business models. in the DCMI activities, work groups and workshops, standard conferences and workshops, standard services and educational efforts to achieve extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. so long the pictures on the camera are designed to use this as temporary fuse.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a complex editing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images with & digiplug, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut off by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. then export them into MPEG, use in MPEG, use in contact page, print & etc.</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digious; in the Add a Photos to an album you will find a description as you have already on your hard drive, but the camera-interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your album tank.</seg>
<seg id="249">For your digital camera with & digiplug; in order to use, connect the camera to the display mode and turn on it. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you launch the camera-interface, this will take a while with your camera. if the connection is made, a Fertig indicator appears at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will display. some cameras do not display thumbnails for each file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information to any entry. with the lateral bars and metadata in the camera-interface you can see the properties of a single entry or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and the photographic information that internally are stored by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that on some digital cameras not all information is available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer instructions, GPS etc. of the image. this information is the same as in the metadata side bar from the main window of & digious; or the image processing. note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is clicking on the button download and then download the selection from all photos. this download the photos from your camera to a single album in & digious; and we suggest you to check if the pictures are securely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, please select the desired with the default selection methods of & kde. once you chose the photos, use the button selected to be selected until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option new to download is available. these images have been downloaded from & digious; in this case the new images are displayed with a star at the front window. if you select this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you use the buttons you can download all or selected files, a dialog with which you can select the target album will be displayed in which the photos can be stored in the section My albums are displayed in the section My Albums. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selected the target album, press OK, and & digicame; downloads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photographs you can delete it from the camera. you can delete all of them by clicking the button deleting all. if you want to delete only some, then you must first select it and then delete the chosen Delete.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there are no way that you have deleted from the camera, you'll be sure to delete the photos. if you want to delete the camera from the camera, you should carefully check if you want to delete the camera target, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras are used as a filename for the photos often not particularly meaningful name. this can normally revert after the photos from the camera. this can be useful to double filenames in the same album. so it can be useful, the date and time when the image is done to integrate in the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and flip the image and for date baskets. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options during the transfer will open three further options, which are stored before the photos on the record are stored. if you select, the respective entries are copied from the EXIF data into IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the standard format, for example, you can use the prefix photo -%% m-% d% H:% M: to do this option add date & time. for more adjustments you should read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file name, you will have the option to change the file names in lowercase letters. or in uppercase letters, if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digiplug; used for a picture, will display the camera in preview. your settings are stored and automatically used when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digious; can use all the information on the orientation of the camera to the time point of admission. not all cameras make this information ready. in section page bar metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally turned on, and if your camera doesn't deliver this information; the photo in the original orientated. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the automatic rotation in the lower range of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information on the date when the photo was made available, you can use this information in the target album. all pictures with the same date are based on image data. in the section page bar Meta-data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally off, and in this case it stores & digious; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, use the button Advanced and then select the dates based under the window at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to their camera is the button downloading. then choose uploading. the file selection dialog & kde appears where you can select the files you want to upload. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, ask & digiplug; you, where the pictures will be loaded high. select the folder selection dialog for the camera. choose OK to launch the upload. the pictures are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document, which can be displayed in length and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the determination of the data can be performed by the US GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interested in combining a picture with a precise geographic site. not everyone uses an aircraft to photograph an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environmental, police, police, architectural offices and real estate makler can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten that, where exactly the photo was taken, you can click with a click to open the area. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digious user; if you want to locate a postcard to another & digious user, if you want to document the location of the photos, it is good to save the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how come the GPS data in the image? first, you should know that exiv2 is supported in these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the correct hardware, via a reprocessing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic information (manual) and lastly via manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has a GPS unit integrated. but there are a few working with GPS receivers working together. either as a card module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: coyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR rioh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading of GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or GPSBabel. you must save these data in the GPX format, as this is the only format supported by the module to geographic mapping.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are several programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same as & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>

<seg id="286">Autology is a synonym for author: this field should be the professional name of the photographer. this can be names like e.g. a photographer, freelance photographer or independent photographer. as this is a closer description to the car field, this must be also filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for vendors: use this field to specify the photo. this must be registered here, if this is a message agency e.g. a Reuters, or Associated Press. if the picture is a storage picture, the group or agency should be included here.</seg>

<seg id="293">The settings of the illuminated by & digiplug; can be switched on this page on the standard values. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. if you have a look at the entire image, you can only get better viewing results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can switch them here. you can switch the toolbar when you use image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in the image processing this viewpoint can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling, it is meant that the images are coded in higher resolution than in colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia about the previous explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With SetPNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not decrease the image quality, as PNG is used for a quick calculator. if you have a quick calculator, you can set this value to high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option to compress TIFF-files, you can switch the deflate compression salms for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF image. it has no effect on the image quality as the deflate algorithm is freely working.</seg>
<seg id="299">With setting lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you have written the lossy setting, the ratio of quality loss and file size is far better than at the normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digicame, image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, the image processing is very fast to manipulate your photos. with this dialog you can change the image processing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default value is that all green pixels are equal in sensitive to sensitive to ultraviolet light. if you use this option a little bit soft, this option is drawing a little bit soft, but eliminates the 2x2 image patterns with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white powder is used immediately, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard it is set to set a solid colour balance, which was photographed on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. in four steps, this option is ignored for more details. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the shlichter, so the parts of your camera are burned as transparent and white in the settings. simply use the setting-in white in the settings. this setting color produces some unusual results as it shows the shlichter in various roatars. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the shlichens.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not so fast glued like green and red. & dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red shares in the still not saturated blue pixels. of course this is a question how much colour or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you get the option to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted individually for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the Luminanzas according to your taste. you probably have to put it somewhat higher than the standard 1. this can also be done later in the picture options of & digious; order to keep the time for the demo board, so you should be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A DemosaCap algorithm is a digital image process to draw a complete picture from the particles-filtered image sensor that provides many cameras and that a matrix of colorless pixels is available. this algorithm is also known as CFA-interpolation or colour construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digicame; and Dcu came with you three alternatives: Bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD Interpolation (for adaptive homogeneity Directed) was the first algorithm for me and that of me used. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue-correction values here. this is certainly the best method for one color correction, since you are done during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates colour information and provides instructions as it should be given back. there are also LCMS and & digious; information how to translate the colour information from a colour space in the other, so that colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior questions when a picture is opened in image processing / color administration module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile folder Put here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, in which you store all your profiles. & digiplug; examine these files during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the pipe file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your pictures color manages not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera operator and model you are using. not all profiles are contained in the same way. there are some, like Canon, which do not have a color mapping or gene structure. currently, the crab gamma doesn't corrects for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to carry out the dytapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft-Proof profile which you can emulate how to print your image from one device again. this is very useful before you can print a smaller colour space than your camera and some colors, therefore you could manually adjust it to the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is fairly obviously what color profile is intended for what is intended for. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is of course inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profiling extension makes the style for the target: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a range of & kde; image viewer and imaging procedures; many modules support, which were written to support with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules that you want to use, and they are then loaded by & digious; here you will find some new entries in the menu of the main window and beyond.</seg>
<seg id="323">Shortcommands for tasks assigned by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) over KIPI modules you can get via the KIPI project via http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the Manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the image passes, normally, 4-5 seconds are good. the other checkboxes switch on the metadata one or from, which are displayed at the bottom end of the pictures during display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras. on the right hand, there is a camera that is connected to the computer. if you want to use it, you will see that the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the picture display mode. currently, there are Serielle, USB and USB / FireWire mass memory.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage camera. this field is only active when you choose a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera. you must specify here the path, / mnt / Camera or / mnt / you, specify when you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use & digious digital camera, you need to connect and turn the camera to the display mode using your computer.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out whether & digicame; the camera will automatically detect your camera. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it will display the window of the main window in the menu. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>

<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digiplug, you will find further information on this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digicame; contains quick picture processing with some basic tools. you can use it to preview and improve your photos. image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the entry and selection of the single entry / editing menu.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digious; therefore, some of them are not part of your distribution. for further information on the KIPI modules you will find in the image processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the filename, the file number, and the current image size indicates.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar on the upper border and among them the tool bar for quick access to the most required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">Editing functions of image processing change your photos. however, no the functions will change the original photo before you use the Save or the button Save from the toolbar. note that you can not recover the original photo after you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you may need to make a copy of your image before you change it. this can save you with file saving as well.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can re-produce the original image by using the image Editing or Restore the button Recover to the toolbar. you will lose any change that you have done at the photo since last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any action of image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by selecting the edit and restoring your editing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should attach the keyhole, Ctrl; -z for reversing and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you select the & LMB; on the toolbar a moment longer, you get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions will be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can move between photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, picture down or the entries in the menu file. if you have made changes to the current picture, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can add in the picture and zoom in to you ctrl; click or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the request menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To suit a photograph to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. usually, you will come to the normal view where you enter the Esc key. usually, you can change this at the Settings dialog by & digious; you can also modify this in the Settings dialog by & digious; You can view this from the & digious window; see the section for setting up image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the actual picture, select the image file and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or entire phrases. entire image preview can select from your selection. you only need to select the images from your selection and select Export Wizard. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">& digicame; main window has a sidebar on the right edge, which provides important information and promotions for the selected images. the same sidebar is also available in the image processing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked.</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear again in the rim.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the label view you can input or paste labeling with unlimited size. this text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters you are allowed to be used in EXIF and IPTC data so you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data support only ASCII-characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut according to 2000 characters. if you want to use the IPTC-labelling field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, use either the button Apply or change to the next picture, the inscriptions are then stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user button there is a button more. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. this will always be done if you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section review shows the evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. the rating from the sidebar is always applied to a picture at the same time, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field directive. encoding follows the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword shows a search box for filtering of the keyword, the keyword tree and a selection box with the previously applied in this & digious box; session applied.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered keyword. you can limit the number of ways in search of a keyword quickly. this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another relief when typing stitches in a picture series. if you have typed various keywords, they are stored for the quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the respective check boxes in the tree. all keywords are stored into the keyword in the IPTC field.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main screen, and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this only applies to the highlighted image, if you want to apply a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar keyword filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, data, keyword and search intentions. if additionally, one or more keyword filter from the right side are used, only the cut quantity of these two will be displayed. all created keyword will be available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also pull and off. suppose you have chosen several images in the main view, you can simply drag it out from the right sidebar and place them on the selection. then there's a dialog that you asks if you wish to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window shows the images on one calendar tag. the keyword filter stands on no keywords that were reduced to three images. they were drawn with Strg + a, and afterwards a keyword out of the right keyword tree has been drawn to the selection and stored there. a dialog is asking whether this keyword will be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place in every start of the program. it can also be switched off under settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created, and find that it should be one or not, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control range.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry to which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can define a Extended search on all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, only use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button grouping. the options see as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution there.</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why one sets a color-managed workflow, which is the colors produced by your camera or scanner, you can reach that the colors on your monitor or scanner can also display them from your camera or scanner which are the colors you want to print or publish in the web from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme comes to colour management, you want to know which buttons he wants to press for the results he wants. in addition, you should provide adequate background information about colour management at any point of the image processing workflows. in addition, links with deeper information allow you to make your own informational decisions that you receive the desired results.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all of the six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color administration.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor which is calibrated onto the sRGB colour space. (further information please see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other picture spending is available by e-mail or the web, where sRGB is de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life for everyone so simple, why should one use another color space and so that thoughts on color managed to make?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colours we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all the colors that we can see the hufez region, and the colours in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB using some larger colour spaces, please visit Bruce Lindblock's excellente page and click on info and then on information About RGB Working spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to calibrate my monitor when I decided to work in a sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in sRGB color space or do not, you'll need to work your monitor as sRGB format. if you are working as a color space of sRGB, you must either use your monitor on sRGB-standard kallibrieren, a suitable monitor profile or do both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool presents five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before trying to proceed further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, abject, automatical and contrast extend from the menu Corrigating Automatic correction will automatically try out of your colors the best. they will experiment with these effects to see what works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled down the entire picture, so the dark spot is black and the brightest spot as bright as possible without its color latting to change. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Off: this method is adjusted to the luminous factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity curve is the same number of pixels. sometimes it has a very powerful operation, which causes either wonders in an image, or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic abalers: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and the light intensity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the widest possible range and a regroup of all values in between. this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The Weißkale of & digicame; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white comparison of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The Weißpunkt-correction is somewhat limited because you can work with a color space with 8-bits per color. so if you can perform the white-equal in the raw mode, so that you can perform the white-equal in raw mode, so your possibilities will fail to correct the correction.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white noise level protected by the copyrights of Pawel T. Jochym. you start it via the menu entry, white-equal to the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adapted in the size. on the left hand, both the original image can be seen as well as the preview of the tool. if you want to see the original welded structure again, it's enough to click on the bottom window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos provides a red marker. the Luminance of the Pixels under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right up, there is shown a histogram that will change dynamically as soon as you have given a parameter. this histogram is very helpful as you can decide whether one of the three pixels is displayed. the sum is called Luminancy.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shade adjustment lets you enhance or down the shadow of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">By using the above controls, you should use the colour temperature pipette. press on this button and then click on the picture preview to select selected color for calculating the colour temperature of the white comparison. in this way, also the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white comparison with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The coating indicator will increase the colours when more than a color channel of the pixels are overexposed. you will see the combined result in the white comparison. this is displayed in preview as pure indicator and does not have an effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and store just do this. each adjustment of the white comparison you have set can be stored into a text file and reload later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button defaults reverts all filter values back on its default values and the corresponding neutral white comparison. note that also neutral settings will result in another photo than your original. if you save it, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">Here you can adjust the code depth per colour channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high quality images. however, this coding needs more record field, calculating time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as to the editing of raw images. it uses the change and assigning of color profiles. a detailed guide can be made for the usage of color profiles. detailed instructions for using colour profiles can be drawn to the chapter color administration.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find in the menu under colours sound correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously, so you can also use this for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner will always need the same error and therefore you will always find the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation, that you will find under colours gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The digiplug has four color effects, a solar thermal effect, a Velvia filter, an Neon Effect and an edge filter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of the chemical processing, the term of the process was developed, even Sabatier, an effect of the developed pressure of a short flashlight and subsequently completed the development of the picture. the result was a partial negatively of the picture. the result was a partial negatively of the picture. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the Solarisation. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically feasible. an additional increase is finally produced by a negative image that is not to produce on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar power supply. the original image is the (1) and the processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation so he does a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. simply try it, he beautifies many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an unaltered rich color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for natural photographers. Velvias strongly saturated colors are, but also some pictures, especially those who barely distinguish between landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neo-filter simulates neon light to the contrast ratio. parameters level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeat the strength of the neonlight. in large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras have often problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual to correct the colour contrast and the luminosity of your photos with the tools in the menu under colours. once you are satisfied with the results you are using the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo of bad lighting conditions you can get the opposite problem. also in this case, you can reduce the saturation instead of saturation instead of increasing it. all the changes you can see in previewing. if you like the results you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple leuchstrength / contrast / gamma is the tool a key correction for improving the exposure. even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you need only the range of the slide. in concrete the three shooting below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three firing are clicked into which to be moved, to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The simplest way to learn the operation is to move the knob and take care of it as the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand, the original and preview of the picture can be seen. the preview is dynamic, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selector can be adjusted, if the histogram is displayed using a linear or logarithmic y-axis. in pictures the large areas of a constant colour is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle frequencies, frequently gammasts.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour pushes can be used in preview of the original image, in order to adjust the input values of the shade, medium and bright tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls which can be used to evaluate the output values as well as with the input values, for example, the compression of the output values can be used for example as a background to be seen in the background.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this knob the image values are automatically set in dependence on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons the set values in the file system are stored and later loaded again. in addition, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">When you use this mode and the three colour pipettes, the input files will automatically be adjusted for all shades, means and solar panels. select the colour pipette that you want to use and click on viewing the original image to set the axis program for red, green, blue and the Luminanzchannels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Attachexposure Indicator controls all color channels to view overexposed pixels and view the combined result of all channels. this means you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the alignment of the input rates applied on the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and Alpha Canal, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side the half of the original and the target picture will appear. the preview can dynamically be updated depending on your settings. the following options are available on the right-hand side:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier channel: this selector allows to specify the channel which is altered by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Beside this box there are two symbols to switch between linear and logarithmic view. in this case, linear mode is the most meaningful one. for pictures with large areas of a constant colour the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode is used.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a short valves to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can look that these bright tones will correspond to a darker outfit and the associated image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red mark to see. if you want to change this markings on the curve, which is a matching line on the curve, which is the original value. create a point on this line and move it up, until the value is adjusted for your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. every curve which you can create can be stored in the filesystem and later loaded. the file format is the Gimp short format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When you use this method and the three color pipe buttons automatically create the control points of the curve, medium and solar panels. activate the color pipe you want to use and click on the original image to set control points for the rotor, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option Overexposure Indicator controls all color channels to preview overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel, you'll get the combined result. this means you will get the effect only in preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the Luminescale canal. the colour pipette has been placed and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and this corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of & digicame; image processing is a tool to enhance the colour channel or change the color-shorts of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors Channel Mixer.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first hint as you can correct the relative distribution and precipitation. the left corner of the window will show you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with its own riders.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position this in the picture a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Checks for the module are right below: control knob for red, green and construction allow you to quickly change these channels. this is particularly convenient if you tick the respective color components. this is particularly convenient if you can select the color mixer then DAS Tool for creating great black-and-white conversions of your photos. please try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of color becomes a visible noise, which looks from color-space. if that's the case you can reduce your Monochrome conversion as a result in which you can reduce the color of color.</seg>
<seg id="447">Saving as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any blender setting can be stored for later and then load them. the used file format is the Gimp-mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Attachexposure Indicator controls all color channels to view overexposed pixels and view the combined result of all channels. this means you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re-reset. the flag can be preserved. the original image is visible under (1) and the processed picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photograph has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photographs is black / white one step, because color images can easily be converted onto the computer. also with a set of film roller profiles.</seg>

<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / W film exposure with a green lentil filter. this looks good for all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. so much like the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orante: simulates a black / W film exposure with an orange linter filter. this enhances landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orangered.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotix: simulates a black / W film exposure with a red line filter. this creates dramatic asceffects and can simulate moon light to the time of the day. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) rotic filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / W film frame with a yellow line filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) jaundice.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepcolon: creates warm bright and medium sounds while he adds a little of cold in the nopia. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and the recovery in a sepia. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and with it similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digiplug; tool texture apply, you can apply decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your picture, regardless of whether it's a color image, or not, you can look like an oil painting on a canvas, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a mural on a wall. the menu entry texture can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the semblance of depth and triple-dimensional texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper of textual work has been applied on the picture below. the original image is (1) and that changed under (2). the relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">The digiplug wall came; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of an viewer in the limits of a photo is not a slight task. a possibility of keeping his attention is to make the image an decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the moving eye. under picture frames, the module can be restarted from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the required design type for your image. surround it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), ringed it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a push of a button and decorative adds a zierframe with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This with the scope of decorated target image will be bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert simple a formatted text into a picture of any place. this also passes several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type the text and place it with the mouse. use the character set, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties like you need. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background. already, the picture is ready.</seg>

<seg id="469">With the digiplug & digiplug tustencil tools you can apply a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu stencil template uses in the image processing can be used to place templates through a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there is no restrictions regarding the size and orientation. you need to use the PNG file format and you should add to the maximum compression of the file size; if you want to add a template to & digious stencil, please send an e-mail in english to the & digiplug; mailing list digicame-user @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your templates with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied templates. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder is set for templates, a tree view appears, which reflects the folder structure of the stencils. the selection of a folder will update the templates automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Among the previewing are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob increases the displayed picture. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Residing: this knob scates the underlying image below. it is centered around the position of mouse. if you want to apply the template onto the whole picture, please check the image correspondingly. please check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the picture lying under the template. take the picture and place it in the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply template to your image. the image is then adapted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicame; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but produces especially in dark areas, grained pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">The sharpness mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharply. actually, it does not work to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Focus is perhaps the best of the three, as it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjusting.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus and most digital pictures require a correction of the sharpness. this is where sharp edges can be summarized as a colour. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras do normally need more retroactively counteracts as normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">With JPEG image, a camera has had applied internal sharpness. images in the shell format must always be sharpened in during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners turn a hot air already while reading the image. if you disable this, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening value. this allows you to exit with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">But you should use carefully, since the results do not work very naturally: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but amplifies the noise. in general, you can focus on the menu entry Corrigating Refocus. you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw a bit soft to sharpened. use the tool to soften with the menu entry and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharper mask is a very good tool for removing veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help you to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should first try out. if you make the sharpness mask too strong, noise and impression of grats will produce in the proximity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is a how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter. high resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, they should be sharpest pictures of the best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the recorded picture which is added to the original. thereby, the thickness of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling is a breach of the maximum RGB value and the use of the difference. this way you can use a minimum difference to prevent a canopy of filters. in this way, areas with a soft change between the sounds from sharpening off and therefore disease errors are avoided in faces, hides and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of unsharply masked filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). unsharply masked was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The digicame; tool Refocscissors focus on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries a picture to & quot; refocerquot; in which the defocus is used. this is better to use a technique called FIR Wiener filtering. the traditional technology used to sharpen images is the use of a sharpness mask. you can start it from the menu by pressing colors refocals in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular bloc works much better than the Gauss's Faltung. the Gauß's Faltung has a very long tail, which is far from the original boulevard, which is far from the original quills of the Gauß's flushing is affected in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Spherical sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should be good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very unsharply but on Heiligenscheine.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: the correlation of correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation is reduced to the sharpest effect of module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the room filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values are higher than 0.1. however, values are higher than 0.1. however, values are very poor. a useful value is 0,03. a high value is not getting dirty.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss's sharpness. use this parameter if your unsharpness is used. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the rushing filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrizenman: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results especially if you choose large values for the circular sharpening or the gauss's sharpness. in most cases you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any interface parameters which you have set will be saved for later and then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the cutting, colour and intensity colors on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes are not immediately visible, which left unpleasant artifacts later.</seg>
<seg id="507">To read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharply produces better results than sharpness. this could cause the unsharply masking a bigger neighborhood used as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, inevitably, inevitably create artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the unsharpeness filter. basically, the result of the FIR Wiener filter is always at least as good as the unsharpness mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small, focused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original resulting color image has to be corrected. this image has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is attributable to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For further information on the sharpening structure in digital images, you can consult a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob smoothed the sharpness of the range of the darkened, to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tinte allows a customized color for the pupils. if you want blue eyes rather than dark, you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools in order to remove the artifacts with an unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The inert algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains several preferences as Starpoints to simplify the restoration. presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you wish to adjust the filter settings, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail posture p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of details. a small value leads to an even smoothing over the image. the value of 0,9 should preserve more homogenous regions of smooth and details. a value of 0.9 should not be subsequently necessary. please note that the detail in detail should always be subordinated to the accuracy of accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="520">Accuracy-dependent alpha [0,100]: a small value smooths evenly throughout the directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film bearing or CCD noise, a high value of waves can produce similar pattern. JPEG Artefacts will be picked up at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth finish [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all es. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value matching the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it becomes difficult, as it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turmoist effect, it needs to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: specifies how often the algorithm is gone through. usually, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Elbows [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha is chosen, it should also be selected small. note that small angles are to be selected a long runtime. you should choose this value as much as possible and unacceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated stride length [0,1, 10]: integrated stride length in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel pitch, and never greater than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the more of quality you get by selecting this option is low. however, it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and store just do this. every setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and be loaded again later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image error correction is comparatively fast at work. however, it can last very long and still take a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button departure.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors are taken with minor artifacts. the module is taken on a picture taken in Guatemala City with a analogue camera. as you see, there is a unique black artifact in the foreground to see through a bad film location during the trip. the original image is below (1) and this corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">"" "the digiplug is a very powerful tool to reduce the noise. it uses an unprotected algorithm by Peter Heckert." ""</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool is available for selectable viewing angles, to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise which can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you will only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings menu can remain in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controlled the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filter is required per pixel and can make the image affected by the radius and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller faults.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: determines the sharpness underneath the filter distance the filter looks forward to see light turns. if it is increased you will need to adjust the edges of the filter. if the value is too high, adaptive filter details can no longer receive and noise, or lubricate it again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: monitors the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong can't appear the whole worm or bootleg, put it on a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that controls the details dialog.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls color tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that controls the details dialog.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: control the Gammatoleranz of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker parts, which typically are stronger than the shadow zones.</seg>
<seg id="541">Shock absorption: determines the alignment of the phasenic shock absorption. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius is responding to the edges. if it is increased, noise and phasenjitter may appear on the edges. it can remove noise points and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters of the precondition that you have set can be saved in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how space reducing your life can change. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected word (2). the precondition is used with standard settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. fortunately, this solution is to sharpen a bit soft and experiment with the menu entry to sharpen and experiment with the glasses. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digicame; photo restoration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoring gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your images. it is very good adapted to remove Gauß's smoked, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that make the content of the image contours and thereby receives the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for colour and texturing. the texture rendering is done with another tool, the image error correction. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannkrei and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a lossy compression glassot; - small standards that are shown in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and store just do this. every setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file later and loaded again later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively fast at work. however, it can last very long and still take a high CPU load. you can therefore interrupt the calculation at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce your photo with equalising noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera onto a Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film bearing on the faces. the original image is visible under (1) and this corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures reduced to an old colour photo taken with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by scannerlighting and the photo paper. the original image is visible under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">& digiplug & digiplug) captures hotpixels of photos that were taken with a CCD camera. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project protected by copyright Martin Dickass.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem associated with high quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression by a built-in repression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixquot; and "quot; light pixel quot; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark. the tool will automatically recognise the hot and bright pixels. these will be highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you can connect the dark picture directly to a new hot or light pixel by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the matching dark picture to the correct image. note that the wizard will notice the latest dark image and recharges it automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview can help you correct the outcome. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all areas of sight.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: an average of the neighboring board is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defectives in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linearly: all pixels that have a distance of 1 of the pixel block are moved to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a gap of 2 or less to the pixel block are pulled to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a gap of 3 or less are moved to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotter correction on a color photo, from a broken digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposures. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and this corrected image is visible under (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The digiplug is provided; Vignetting correction is a tool for the Vignetting, i.e. exposed corners, to correct an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the medium and large photo format, frequently illuminate the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they will reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light the sensor there. Teleobjects also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has drawbacks. many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lens should also use the center filter, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, because otherwise unintended effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposing areas of today's filament and the paint- or grey-grafts from digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a centerfilter that is used without these filters. the tool Vignetting correction applies to a picture. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators, you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of beam damping at the point of the largest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, eliminating an optical filter with a lens adjustment of 2, or accidentally offset the density to compensate a bigger degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate a little degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchstrength, contrast and gamma-settings: the editing of an image with the Vignetting correction reduces the layer thickness of the pixels. you must adjust the exposing of the target image with these options, as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine re-adjustment of exposure of the target image, so leave the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero, and use the gradation of the & digiplug function; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction on a picture. the original image (1) shows the correct picture in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a layer of a layer and contraction structure was also performed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digiplug is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses in photos. it uses a copyright algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex shape of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect, but flattens off the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth engraving corrects the removed corners to the second degree. when you combine these two, any geometrical distortion is almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the thickness of distortion-second Grades. with negative values, tons of globular distortions can be corrected and positive values conscientious distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of distortion. this value affects more strongly than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'Corner Parameter has the reverse order of the parameter tab.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and thus leads the correction to the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image increases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview of distortion correction. the values you use for your image will be saved and used for the next start as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tons or conscientious correction should be carried out before all cutting or size changes. in the best result, do this correction as all of them. if you have a new picture of the picture, the effect of the effect would be apparent.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction for you to view this tool a vertical and horizontal relief line. move it to an important place, such as the sea side or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. in the connection you can correct the tons / cap interlock with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you adjust a conscientious distortion, the resulting image will have black edges. you can edit them with the cutting tool in the menu editing or using the zoom knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images the tons-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motives like photos from the front, frame and paintings are the perspective so to correct this when you keep the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tons-shaped correction to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of Gimp's mobile devices which can be reached under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this movie has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red right angle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can adjust two parameters set of film bearing and film sensitivity to you if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO knob changes the amount of film bearing and dominance of green green (chlorophyll in nature) in the conversion. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter channel mixes to reproduce infra film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter applied mainly to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is shown below (1) and the image has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The digiplug section is an easy-to-use tool for reproduce film bearing on your images, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers great pemulsion by the manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film body effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets rid of daily lives. in case you want this special, gallery-like, road photographic, corpus sight especially in your monochroms photos, so you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although frequently higher values are needed, if you need more grains, so you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film adaptation to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked (2). the used movie sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The oil painting came; filter oil paintings created the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The digiplug & digiplug filters make your digital pictures a nice look like oil painting. natural pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controllers to influence this effect. the top chooses the brush size between one and five out. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smooth, smooth or, viewed from the other side, the smoothness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the working is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smoothte 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The digiplug & filter used; filter charcoal drawing uses colour and intensity gradient to produce an carbonic acid. therefore, images of whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you choose which scene you would have chosen to sketch. this would be good pictures to start.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob chooses the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal label filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digicame; filter engraving is shaped your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it was used by copyright protected by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digicame; filter engraving is a fast tool for converting your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where colour is not the most important at the content. the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to transform the image into a gray, montory landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to set the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distortion-effects. it is used by copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and lets it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analog to the wavelength 1, the image is distorted with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can stop these effects at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of acuity effects. it uses protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom in sharpness: wiping the image along stone-shaped lines starting from a center. this simulates the sharpness of a zooming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in the sport photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radiale unsharpening: wiping the image by turning the pixel to a center. this simulates the sharpness of a turning camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance sharpness: get the image to produce the effect of a non-focused camera lenses. the object seems to be back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement of motion: get the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear movement, z: B: from a car or train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softness: make the image soft into the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or add a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schütting: blends the image by random postponing of the pixels and thus simulates the sharpness of a completely moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent inacuity: find the colour bins in the image and get it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the picture in rectangular cells and then created it by colt with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">Shelters are a nice small tool to make reentroping on your image. this gives it natural your images a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn protected by copyright.</seg>
<seg id="625">The drop size allows the size of the drop to change. since the drop-size is not altered automatically with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce size for small images. number changes the number and the density of the drop. fish eyes changes the optical effect of the droplet on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">"" "" "" "you can also have a section free from shelves. to do this, please use a range of tools in order to select the area, e.g. a face which will remain free. if you start checking the filter, the area will remain free from shelters." ""</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the rainy filter. the original image (1) shows a peaceful sunset and the processed picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or turning to the right orientation. you will find tools in the menu, turning laundering or create mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflatable is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to increase a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture of shrinking is easy. the big question is, how can you zoom in and out the details? how can you invent the missing information? how can you invent the missing information? how can you see the missing information again? how can you see the missing data? try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select the size of change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is below to see.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to size is using a linear interpolation method to increase the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the inflatable.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digicame; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool like you want to change the size. these settings are available in the rider New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">If this setting is enabled, the new size is retained in the original size of the original size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it becomes difficult, as it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turmoist effect, it needs to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons save as and load are used exactly to this. each setting for photo can be saved as text file and reloaded again later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflatable is very quick at what it does, but it can still last very long and take a high CPU load. you can stop the calculation at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of the photo above, by increasing a little color image on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3) is the result of linear standard magnification.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a commonly performed surgery, but also a common underestimated tool to create a picture. to cut a photo with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and pull the rectangle, then you'll see this rectangle in while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you release the mouse button again the area of the photos is cut out. this will make a good overview of your photo after cutting, by pulling at the corners of the rectangle, simply create a new rectangle with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button "button" button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo will be cut properly (Ctrl + + X). to store the entries and save file under the menu, in order to save the newly added photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the viewing area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio, which you have defined in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool Following aspect ratio you can specify the orientation as high-format or landscape. in the high format, the larger value of the height and in the scale format is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool Folding aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means it is always the same whether you can use centimetres, inch or any other physical size. for example, you can see a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, two buttons exist to automatically center a horizontal or vertical.</seg>
<seg id="647">In the dialog box, you can set the max. ratio button to set the area to the maximum possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool appears according to the aspect ratio (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are stored as standard values in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data are reflected in the EXIF data and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The help of alignment aid allows you to blend help, so that you merge your images better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonious particles are based on the principle of resemblance. as the third party ails, harmonic triangles are possible to share a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles in the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division which covers various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus mussel or the flower leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things we feel beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the irrationale number 1.618033988... and it was already used by ancient Egyptians and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you summed up your images, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition that this rule will follow as a visual harmonic.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides smoother relief lines when you put together a picture. these help are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third party the golden Spiral creates a liquid line of the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the look of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangle of the golden Spiral, also known as gold rectangles. this rectangle is used to produce the golden spiral. this can be a line its or different objects. this can be one line his or without the eye, it's going to fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles are also slipped from the top discussed golden Spirals. on the side, these vertices are the center points of the golden rectangle. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equivalent to place. diagonal to position these lines can be place more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to place your frame, you will create a effect of place by professional photographers dynamic symmetry. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach any other.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">Using the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool for turning a picture to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens easily to fix the camera or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the things are turned around an angle. you can fix this with the & digious rotation. simply select rotation and adjust the rotation angle of rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slide are stated in degrees. by default, you can reset the slider again to 0 degree. a preview of rotation is displayed on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image will be shown in the upper right.</seg>
<seg id="664">At your help, the module offers horizontal and vertical line at your disposal. move the cursor in the picture preview to position the two lines. once you have moved him over an important point of the image you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now, adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find unwanted dirty holes in the corners. one way to repair this is the function transformation into use from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to crop the image is Automatic crop. choose one of the options below:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing token the image a bit after rotation. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All output transformations are performed by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is displayed in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">In order to change the perspective, you need to re-use the red squares at the corners of your image. on the right side of the dialog, you will find some information which help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including empty areas that were created by transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including empty areas that were created by transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left at the top: shows the current angle in degrees along the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle left at the top: shows the current angle in degrees along the upper right corner of the transformed surface.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left at the bottom: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed countryside.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image gets somewhat dirty. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adaptations create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective, you get unpleasant dirty holes at the corners. a way to clean it is the image with transformation cut from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The sound tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. this is no rotation, the image is distorted to the right and lower part to the left. with other words, a rectangle is transformed into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Sheer your image by using the Horizontal angle and vertical angles. if you press presets, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help a vertical and horizontal line appears. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the checkbox to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the calibration, the image will wipe a bit. for a single shift this effect is usually negligible, but two shots are generated twice as much of the wounded and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the etching, the image has unnice triangular holes in the corners. a way to eliminate these is the image with cutting cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digicame; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the type like this libraries comparted. in most distributions, you will be able to process a large number of image formats with & digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on its system, but you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>

<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to find the most used format. a more detailed description of these file formats could be found in Wikipedia. & digiplug; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the use of data compression processes on digital images. redundant information is reduced to this way to save the image data to an efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results as JPEG with the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also store lossless when this is specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">In case you want to learn more about the raw aspect ratio, so you can read from Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour. you can convert rough files to JPEG or TIFF with the Rohingkonverter of & digious; you can find more information about the use of modules with & digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="690">& digiplug; also supports the loading of raw images only with the program dcraw, which is contained in & digious formats. all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coffin. the table below shows a short list of raw formats that came from & digiplug; supported:</seg>
<seg id="691">Many digital cameras support recording short films. these clips are often stored in AVI- or MPEG-format. therefore, these formats and therefore are not compatible for films. if you click on a movie file, & digiplug; the & kde; settings for playback of movies use to play the program to play.</seg>

<seg id="750">& dot; -algorithm, the standard for coated graphics. he produces hierarchical or layered images of directed graphs. the algorithm dominates the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges and possible few cantons.</seg>
<seg id="751">& neato; algorithm is the standard for uncoated graphics. he produces representations according to the jump spring model. thereby, the Kamada Kawai algorithm is used, which is equivalent to statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm created for uncoated graphics a jump spring model layout. it uses the Fruehman-Reingold-Heuristik, and includes a multi-slitter for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm calculates the nodes circular in accordance with the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese in 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multi-cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Open a dialog in which you can specify a layout command, which is then executed by a shell. the command should give the graphic command to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command you can use & eg; to modify the & graphs; or modify the graph with a filter, before it is drawn.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographical localization allows it to add and process GPS coordinates into the images of an image. the geographic data is stored in the EXIF data and the localization can be displayed in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to locate images of geographically in the spherical coordinate system, which is used by GPS and Galileo, to locate. height, longitude and latitudinal degrees are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in the GPX format. GPSBabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Picture Geographical localization correlator. this interface can lead a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. to run a possible correlation of time and localization, you must download a file file with GPX file, of course, data taken at the same time at the same places as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded an automatic correlation which shows the coordinates in red. GPS Spurdates are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera-time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. this will be done with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The adjustment for maximum time variance indicates a upper deviation for the GPS-time and camera-time. if the deviation from among them is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have any track data from a location for pictures you can edit the GPX file manually and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have a suitable data. if you know that in reality a location in a great time difference between camera and GPS is, you can place it here and then make the button correlated.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have a set of photos on the same place. as the coordinates change to the next place you just have to use the button OK to put the data in the current picture.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found with the displayed map and be placed. select the relevant region and enlarge it. the amount must always be selected manually. the card can always be selected manually. the card can always be selected manually from the card mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside of the KIPI module, there are options to attach the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that the exiftool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Module Collection Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for HTML pages. the character set will be encoded with UTF-8 encoding.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings can be customized. the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML. with the three buttons on the right hand you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below is shown the Albenpreview and the text that will appear in the head of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider Appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely inexplicable. the option for each image is created itself. if you click on a picture a new page is shown in the picture, otherwise the image will be shown directly with your standard screen, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed.</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated images. choose a folder named KIPIHTMLExport, which contains everything there will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you chose the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original pictures will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the default color depth. it also affects the file size. all other settings are explicable.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider screenshots allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album riders for the thumbnails which are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user as far the action is. press Cancel to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore see if errors appear during the generation. the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery. press Close to connect the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI picture viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations like spins, zooming or shifts. the viewer can be used with short commands and folders. it has been designed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start a picture is shown as default in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG lossless module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows to store images in JPEG format, without storing the usual losses on quality and metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the lossless storage is the size of the file size, since there is no compression of the color information. this can be found e.g. at PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client is currently no documentation. if you are interested in writing, please contact the mailing list of KIPI teams under kde-imaging @ kde.d. please Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module Metadata Editor currently has no documentation. if you wish to change this situation please contact the mailing list kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from a picture to another. then choose the image file dialog with which you want to copy the target picture, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata. the data will be copied after that you have pushed the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work in all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not in any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please refer to exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to convert selected pictures into a MPEG-video, with a defined length to convert. this module uses the packages of Mjpegtools and ImageMagick. you can also add a base image to the slideshow. you can also add an audio file to the MP2 or WAV of the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically synchronized to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can choose a background color for the slideshow. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. finally, you can use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the pictures that are packed into the MPEG slide show. then you can launch the module about extras easily.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then monitored under picture files in the Portfolio, where you can also change the images or content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your listing, you should select the video format from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds which will display a picture. a low value generates very sudden, a high contrast very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case you should leave them black. the name and path of the generated file can be set to you under the name of the MPEG output file. if possible, please keep the extension mpg if possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, then you can start the production of the movie. depending on the speed of your computer you can now enjoy the generation of your computer. depending on the speed of your computer you can now enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow, if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the Mjpegtools and ImageMagick packages to adjust the settings right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer driver allows to print multiple images on one sheet of paper along in standard Photosizes. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is for example: useful to improve or using the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in the RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. a original format from Him is: don't expect it from dcrab to make the same results as the software from your camera player. sometimes you get better results with dcrab better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file that will be converted and launch the module. the Raw Image Converter window appears in mode for a single image. with the button Preview you can view the effect of your current settings.</seg>
<seg id="856">Now you can adjust the values to optimizing the conversion process. the first option decides to adjust the camera values for the white-equal. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-color RGBG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are happy with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The tagged image format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">In case you often have to edit your images or later, you should not use the JPEG format, as it allows only a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG format, the metadata that contain in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF file.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start converting the conversion process. if you want to break down this process, you can interrupt it.</seg>
<seg id="863">The pile-processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, for example, by testing on a single picture, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. here, however, you have the possibility to automatically overwrite files. this is helpful if it has been created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview can be seen on how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can add or enlarge the image size from the image change:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 denim.): normal size change in a dimension. width or height of the image will be selected automatically, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 denim.): resizing change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adapt your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: no proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepare the image for the photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper. the target picture, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module, you can send selected pictures using your preferred email program. it is also possible to preview the size of the larger images in advance. you can also drag and store other images on the list of images.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have launched the module, the pictures window will display the images you want. with a file selection dialog you can add more pictures. for the last selected image you will see a preview on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also draw pictures on the picture list and to add them to the list of images added to you.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the knob pictures you will remove the selected pictures from the list of larger images.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all pictures you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the button OK. you will only need to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures selected by you are already attached as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not mind too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations regarding the size of the E-mails. there is possibly a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and any time used until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you are using the Google Mail service you have to install the Gmail Agent on your computer before. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the selection of comments in a suspended file the comments added to the pictures added to a text file.</seg>
<seg id="882">PNG format under the menu image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to the lossless formats, such as TIFF. therefore, you should therefore use PNG, if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be modified. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG image files and the original files in JPEG format, then the original version data will be added to the previous images.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed so you can view the status messages when searching for errors. your e-mail program will automatically end up at the end. with the button closing, you can shut down this window? EN.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the Advanced Diaschau module, a window with issues such as you wish to have shown your slideshow. you can choose between you selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL passes in the presentation use very elegant image files using OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graphics card, because otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option filenames indicates that the filename of images in the left corner will be shown during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">This option loop makes it possible for your presentation in an infinite loop. you can manually start it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images are randomly chosen, that the pictures are displayed in random sequence. so the order of the pictures will not be used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">In delay between pictures can be set the temporal distance between the individual pictures. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. you should test this from your computer and the chosen transition effect. you should test this before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose. randomly chosen every transition between images and another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left side of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn off.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show.</seg>

<seg id="918">Before HTML pages you need to make some settings, these are divided into three areas of content, layout and target. in the following, every area is described more closely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First you enter the title of the review and a description that will contain the HTML file later. on a photo album; HTML sample pages look for an example of this settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">"" "next, select whether a & photo album" "" "-Export Project" ""; -Export File is to be seen on the reviews page. sew informations about the export-files you will find in. "" "</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to see that all images from a party are obvious. for example, all pictures from a party are. for example, you can't use this setting. currently, you can't use this setting to hide certain pictures from certain considerations.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are clear, which is why they are not received.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures. therefore, those who have viewing your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800x600, no more pictures download, for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The beholder of your site can change the resolution at any time, so he can search your pictures with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if it wants to appear a larger image he changes to higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting area you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best, select a base folder for all of your HTML files and a new subfolder for any subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be stored and automatically select for all future images. here you can select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if they are all displayed for the viewer. if you select for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created, this folder should be displayed here. otherwise, the web browser should start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files have not yet been created in the final destination folder, you must manually copy it to the final destination of the file. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The options described here are based on basfolders or URLs. in this, a subfolder will be created, whose name you specify in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are looking for a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users from & kphotoalbum; you can, of course, take a lot of time to view the images on images, capture, etc., then you have to do with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database. these can be combined with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in that the images are stored in the file or if there is only one link to the file in the file that you have all pictures contained in the file. the obvious drawback is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kim file either directly from the File Station... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that you have given in the .kim file. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML-Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for export images is described, which you can export via the Export menu... call.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. there are three choices available to you:</seg>
<seg id="938">To manually copy the Manually to the .kim file, you will need to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatic to copy the Automatic to the .kim file copy & drop your photo album; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. as most pictures already have been compressed using JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, if you want to compress this too, just select the export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum size limit. if you want to send your friends pictures, you would like to send the pictures in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can say that each picture should be at the maximum 800 pixel wide and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file importing... select, & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to Import has four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, after, in which folders they should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you are named the category people of the implicated file that means (if you are a Dane), while this category is called for your database. therefore, you will be imported into the third dialog box which are to be imported into your database and what Categories are listed in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can remove the categories of the present file with the categories of your current database. an example for this is shown on the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse and watch images: if you look at pictures, you would often like to see images within various picture groups and see a picture with your friend, perhaps you would like to see all images on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will learn the various steps from (1) Set the information about your images, via (2) the browsing and watching, through (3) advanced issues and adaptations.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it was expanded and today also takes care of your videos. many places in this manual will talk about images, but often these videos are often conclusive as well.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photo graphics album; saves all of its information in the file index.xml in the uppermost folder of your pictures. here is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, to back on a diskette or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& photo graphics album; remembers the folder where your images are stored and used for future Starts. if you want to read a different folder in & photo albums, you can start page -c. as an example: photo album -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Above the menu entry menu theme photo album; set up to a window, with which you can change the settings of your photo album; in the following section of the user book you will discuss the various settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can preview the settings and options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call on the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">In it you describe what you can define for each picture of different properties, e.g. persons, places and tags. you can also create your own groups, such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">On the dialog box which is used to process already existing groups. for each existing group you can select an inscription and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section Subcategories have already been mentioned. in the dialog options, you can set up complete list of members, i.e. all members of one group at once in a group instead of all groups of a group as stated.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view of the list of settings you can choose to set up the member groups. with the select list box you can choose the category you want to configure. in the left window of the page you find a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& photo graphics album; shares its modular system with other graphics applications, such as digiplug and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin Interface. sew information on this page you find on the Kipi homepage.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the module. the modules can and are not described in this manual, as they are not sold separately. however, most modules have a help page which you can call on the module yourself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules can be used together from multiple applications together, you can test new modules first with the demo database. therefore, you should ever test new modules with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu Help. don't say, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via KIPI are very different, so that it can be some modules with & kphotoalbum; not functioning. this is the downside if you share functions with various applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications are simply using a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order is not supported, it simulates the order for some modules, so that you can use the features with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">The current album, this simulates the current album, so all images that show you the picture preview is now displayed.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album I have to book a photo album; the modules also displays a list of albums. here are the photo album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser shows the contents of a category, e.g. all persons, then every entry in this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category which you have specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums, so if you are using the category people, so whether you choose people to view the view and share this.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules are equipped with a photo album; not compatible you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog, and select modules which are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a starting screen when you start & get a photo album; start your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are familiar with any other KDE application, look at the top of a menu and a tool bar. at the moment, you will not have a lot of information, since you don't yet have any information about your imagery. in the section, we will display on this window, now you can click on the entry images that shows you an overview with all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see any picture with notes, where the image has been recorded, so you can set any picture individually or for a larger number of images. if for example on all images Jesper is pictured and all pictures in Copenhagen have been recorded.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and Browse as you can read in the section. if you want to see these notes if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In seeing three lists with a text box by setting up persons, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea lies the shift of images within the list. if you have a family celebration, and on all 50 images the same 5-10 people can be mapped, so you can move the names used up, which can be found faster and assign them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to appear a alphabetical list, click on the icon for sort by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image, you may wish to edit all the selected pictures and add them. click in this case simply click on the front and back buttons that are located below the preview of the picture on the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and add the menu item several entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as a group. to show you, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In context menu of the Association dialogs it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new or subcategory. additionally, you can also submit an entry to this entry in order to sort this subcategory this entry. watch out that you can sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the configuration dialog by moving the laces, which form the top of the frame, click and move your own window by moving it outside the window zone.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the look of the window so adapted to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the button options... which offers you the opportunity to save the current structure and look of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also display a frame even fully. if you want to see this window later again, use the button options... and click here window to show up. this process is shown in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in your browser, you will receive an overview with preview images of the currently selected images, or all images in case you do not have a filter here. for example, you can view the size of the thumbnails by simply drag the mouse with the middle button of mouse, configure. just try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you make an image on the background of your desktop, this picture will be set as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this is displayed in the picture viewer. if you don't have a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">"" "you can also delete pictures in the image preview. simply select the respective images you want and select either the Remove" "" "button or select Edit" "" "Edit menu" "". "now you will see the window that you can see in the picture." ""</seg>
<seg id="986">& photo graphics album; you can also use a solution for this problem. you can also use the images anywhere, without having saved on the hard disk. you must, of course, be able to store the images anywhere, so you can see the pictures from & kphotoalbum; if not all required pictures from the hard disk can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images of which the upper right corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard drive. for example, the thumbnails are present in the pictures 1-9. for the pictures 5-9 you can view the thumbnails; however, you can view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function is required to copy files from the folders and copy it again. if you don't want to avoid the inserting of the CDROM, please buy a bigger hard drive to store all pictures on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu you will find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want to add a little more privacy, you can filter the images that you want to see for others and click on the current view. alternatively, you can also check all images that your small sister may check, control and select the menu entry all except the current view.</seg>

<seg id="993">The reason why you want to spend all your pictures with & photoalbum; of course, and hours over hours to describe it, of course, that you want to look at them sometime. this is why you have a picture _ and video viewer. this allows you to preview, as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer you can see in. it shows of course the picture, but additional information you can enter on the picture, like e.g. who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>

<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the donated images. if you want to render only a small area of the image, choose the check box bottom and enter the image section to the rendering in the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination quality you can select the properties, the & Povray; for rendering, this is from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflection lighting. a detailed description of the Render properties can be found in user manual & Povray;</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is riverted with only one ray per pixel, these images often have a Moirè sample or stepped effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally look better with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you switch anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive, because each pixel is further divided and adaptive, because each pixel is further divided and adaptive by the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a beam. if the difference between the colour values for the adjacent pixels is tapping the given threshold of 4, then a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated using a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (b 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, the pixel will be followed by 4 sub-pixels which are individually followed and further for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the records can be adjusted using the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way of reducing the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you switch Jittering, changes & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of the renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; it means very long to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map card you can adjust whether the alpha channels are calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have no object.</seg>

<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import and write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawend.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can extract objects from the object tree in the editor to export the source code for & Povray. this adds to the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor. just select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">Copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can also insert the source code for & Povray;</seg>

<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for viewing in the camera view and in the window type identifier.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the points of object on the grid in context menu of the wire model views. you can set the ring separately for shifts, scaling and turns.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in an accurate wire model and thus a better way for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects like e.g. the ball you can set the detailed stage for two directions separately.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross the high detailed map for advanced projections, all wire-track views are further subdivided, if the camera are using an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of the perspective and the vertical projections. this property gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you tick the wall, a wall is scrapped behind the objects. the wall is displayed in two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross ground, a floor underneath the objects is rendered. the floor is displayed in two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick churchase, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. the values for depth and swelling can be adjusted. more precise information about parameters can be found in section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the section window orders shall be explained how to create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop-down window classification: shows all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen windows of the program at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders. you can add a new arrangement using the button and remove a selected arrangement using the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window structure is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name displays all views for the selected window directions. new views can add and delete selected views using the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column, you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with unanchored the window under the existing window, with map card, you can't get a map view in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to begin with no more accurate knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should make the ultimate but very popular scene under beginners: a ball on a plane.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings, before you notice only a black screen. if you are using a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set any camera, no rules for rendering should be applied, as a result, you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you have no light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you'll get only a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed all error free, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window rules:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to know the menus and the existing icons of the toolbar. please read the documentation, giving you an appropriate performance of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols of the same application as well.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. then select the scene and then select the menu entry. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wireless model view shows how the camera looked at the whole scene, which you can generate. in particular, this is the view of the scene from the camera's viewpoint. this shows you the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree has a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you can see the content of the object properties, in which the different parameters of the camera are found. in the user documentation about & Povray, please see further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything about the basic settings of the camera, this is later instructions reserved, but note that the camera in the view control points you can change with the left mouse button on a control point and draw it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the button Apply or the input button, the wire-size views and the object tree immediately change these settings. as a result, you see here the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could adjust for example a Quader (insertion body Quader) and size at x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100 but this is a fragile method for solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite level as a base:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object tree, change the name and press the button Apply or the integration. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view also shows the plane, even at the moment only a limited finite layer. if you render the scene, the level extends to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree accurately, you will notice the different parameters of the object. in this case, you will see the different parameters of the object. in this case, you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, turn rotation and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the stress line, just to get some of these parameters. choose a shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First choose the floor to hire its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something depending on the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog where you can select how the object is to be inserted. the pigment is then displayed in the object tree. you can preview the name in the property view (name = bottom-pigment), with a click on the button to look how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course shows the preview of pigments only a matt black material because you have to set the settings for the pigment. here you can always think the colors of materials at any time with a click on previewing. also, there are many options, but take the easiest way.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't want to preview color on quads and ball, click on the button Apply and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is right now set. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color. you'll need to enter two new attributes here. in the color list you have to do two new attributes twice. then edit this entry twice (you can do this also more frequently, but the chess board color column can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Choose in the object sagique every time and change colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already work out this step, as you have understood the basics of working of & kpovmodeler; you should have understood the ball as simple as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to press the button or the button Apply button), so the ball will float above the ground because you moved the floor around one unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering now makes a strange result: as seen before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the following step, set a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">When you chose the ball, you can now assign a material to it. like already at the bottom, enter the ball a pigment as colour:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select Preparse Objects and change the name for example in Sphere Pigment. click on ball Pigment, then select inserts and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Change the values as in the following screen photos and click on users or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: still not selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of which possibilities you & kpovmodeler; offers. hopefully you have learnt so much learnt that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is an easy-to-use method to create a two-dimensional photo of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracing a scene, the renderer hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera, which reflects scenes) through any pixel in the scene and how atmospheric effects will work like fog. so the scene is processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine you won't see any camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you see nothing, the picture is simple black. apparently, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">You can select your file in the usual file dialog. POVRAY files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens up a file. you can select a file in the default file dialog, which you have made with & kpovmodeler;</seg>

<seg id="1124">Opens up a dialog to create the tool bar. you can add and remove commands with this option toolsymbols for & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a way to predict rough surfaces without changing any bump on the surface and without changing the geometrical form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file both for a bump-map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are generated from dozens of or even hundreds of these objects. these models will then continue to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base, by using an image file as a color map.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>

<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can be exchanged with Amarook and using Amarook. the simplest way is the use of the command dcop; which should accompany all KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow the run of external programs and commands. in this way, the function exec () is usually used. this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>

<seg id="1483">& K3b; is, like many other & kde; -applications also equipped with a & DCOP interface. using this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled using a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; you can use either the dcop command line program, or the somewhat more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in functional range, therefore rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial to which of the biting programs you specify.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use the command line program dcop. in order to take advantage of the & DCOP; you must first ensure that & K3b is started. then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions, which have all & kde; program painted, supported & K3b; mainly two additional parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The Standard DCOP interface between & K3b; offers functions such as copyCD, format DVD and other features for creating new projects.</seg>

<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, one receives a DCOP reference on the newly created project: # K3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project via # dcop K3b K3b K3b K3bInterface currentProject by using this reference, it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above-listed K3bProjectinterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which can only be applied to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>

<seg id="1492">This allows you to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders, and add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop K3b K3b K3b K3b Interface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT pcop / home / trueg / filfile.txt / foo / bar</seg>

<seg id="1495">& kaudio files; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; files in WAV files on hard disk) and supported by many encoders, which are currently supported for MP3, oggenc for OGGs and FLAC (lossless compression). other encoders can still be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the tracks of the & CD are read and stored in WAV files on the computer (loss-free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step such wav files (usually one per title) compresses in the MP3- or OGG format or even in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocd; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a precompiled package; if this has not yet been installed, this must now be done.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggsuggest (for OGG) or other encoders already exist, so it is probably not necessary to compile anything yourself. however, if FLAC is not used, the installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which coding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer is a small introduction to Kodierer, audio quality and compelling factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already mentioned, uses & kaudiody; cdparanoia to read the audio data from the & CD; it's not possible to avoid any copy of copying them. in any case it is possible to avoid & kaudioDisk; it is not possible to avoid the copying of copying audio CDs; it simply avoid the purchase of copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once must be done (the setup dialog, but can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found), the daily use of a user interface will lead to the comprehension of the slim approach of the user interface that will stumble across the very beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">May & CD; get information from FreeDb from the Internet, or works without a network, whereby everything is detected manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands of the main window. on the side by step, further information, such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1506">If the CDDB will release your CD data in the CDDB tab, which can be installed locally or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be made.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">"" "start reading and - when an encoder has been configured in the tab card settings in the set-up" "" "encoding." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a submenu with a list of available encoder, so that the selection with an other encoder can be read as the standard. it is too aware that the Encoder has been configured in the tab settings dialog in the Settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that an already chosen file will be selected instead of a full & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to specify the type of messages (such as protocols, piepeas) for program events (as read out the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main set dialog by & kaudio files; with different flashcards (such as Encoder, to set the Encoders). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coding and compression ratios and helps you with choosing the right code.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also others such as' shorts' or 'Monkey', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by data compression according to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG can today have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit rates (up to 128 kbps), but over this bit rate the differences become less important because both codiers produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'n't that 'free, but still delivered with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrate), but compared to OGG easily deeper quality with deeper Bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from one computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG devices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo systems. today - at the beginning 2009 - these tools mostly support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for other parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting provides good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = This setting is usually offered for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset Extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset Extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires ever 256 kbps for complex and less complex songs of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR, joint stereo, compression rate approx. 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music by youths, portable devices and car studio plants. but not good enough for better hifi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments if you want absolutely supreme quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information, which is manually entered or fetched by the program from FreeDb, are available in the program as a list of parameters. they can be delivered / used with & kaudio files; and the code name for creating the folder and file name as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs there is often a combination of program settings for the encoders and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; tracks to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switches must be added by lame and the title parameters of & kaudio files; the result looks like this: '-tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiods; parameters that can be used (= button name in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the FreeDb is: a free database, in which persons can read / enter the audio CDs instead of being able to download it by yourself in the calculator. it is to note that here only the text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal but I (note of the author) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent the information from the & CD; however, the information without the artist nor the music business can be added to the music business. all information can be obtained anyway with a bumblebee by a & CD; business, physical or virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudio.net; is active to select a check box (sending an address). for the use of FreeDb can not be used with another (fake) address when retrieving the data from the server (but it can only know the programmer that has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are in many countries copies of the main database. if & kaudioDisk; for using FreeDb, the geographic is to be used on the next mirror server. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedw.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online check-up and CD; information during reading a & CD. alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which echoing program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that it will be used to treat cdparanoia; if you want to read more precisely in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see that the cdparanoia package must be installed first if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To store the read WAV files, the encoders and therefore select the desired file format. during the first opening, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) are displayed on the tab for setting up the code. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the required Linux distribution before the coders may be used. this is also necessary for the predefined coders. more information about Kodierer can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a code reader, further information about his switches can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed factor.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive system, the write and reading files of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;). try to suspend both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could indicate what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD; check out the case of the CD. this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with one step for example. even if you are using other settings, this can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still uncertain what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example and you will get enough information to set up those areas to make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will restart the program for the first time and read our first & CD. we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3v1 sample.</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as precompiled packages for your Linux distribution. for example, it can be found as non-free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files that you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd contains and that you have write permission to have this (eg; you attempt to copy it to the counter-queror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers basic setting up & kaudio files; something that is likely to be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; what to be repeated for each read & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the commonly used codiers for compression of the music (lame) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program to use the FreeDb to download the & CD and download data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them on any reading & CD, if the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The job title is delivered to the leaching program to read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link based on the real device number of your drive. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive can also be used with existing entries of the device drawings for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map card General Settings. here there is no much to do. here an additional conversion will be defined. in our example, everything is shown and typed as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Please, select only for incomplete information, so you will be informed when data are missing to the sample of stitching (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The CD / Settings card; simply select both entries. we are convenient and leave the & CD to download the Internet from a FreeDb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected to the Internet while reading the & CD on the Internet to access the FreeDb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, a & CD entry is found, if you are later unhappy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filename or tag messages, they can easily changed with konqueror &gt; reverse and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, please note: if you want to manually enter the drop-in mode, if you want to download the database before. however, this is worth to use FreeDb locally. however, this will be used twice. to use FreeDb in the open mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first one. this mode is set up on the following map card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us FreeDb. these are settings for the data enquiry for calling the & CD; information from FreeDb server on the Internet. how does the system tell which data the CD is to be received? read the section on FreeDb. put everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to freedb.org and look after a mirror server in your area. on this way the load is distributed between the computers. however, this setting will work as first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equal to the server, as though many firewalls are booting the protocol 8880 according to the protocol, there may be more luck with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to transmit any & CD data to the FreeDb server. the first check box should be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take over the settings of your screen shot. (make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously looting pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive? rip reading and code? the author does not know, therefore simply try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; eject the last piece: cross this around the & CD; throw at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folders for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must be saved to the path / folders in which the WAV files must be saved. if only space is done on a other drive, the files will not be stored in the private folder, if you want to make something yourself with WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All of that type as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances a thing must be chipped to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset Extreme' defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of tags on version 1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can be deleted also in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded WAV files: if a DualCore or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to code more than one WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we have just finished the basic set of & kaudio files; this configuration is used as standard for any reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section is described, as is the process of reading the & CD; we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the type like the music on the hard disk, is described in the previous section, since we are convenient and the & CD is described in this section, must be repeated for each read & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD which is not included in FreeDb, you will see a little different from FreeDb. therefore, you will learn the & CD from FreeDb, you will learn how to retrieve the data manually from FreeDb. comments will be displayed manually from the Internet. comments are drawn to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not yet happened, now the & CD must be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as shown in the screenshot. this only if the & CD can be identified as audio CD; and it could be read from cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, search in the questions and answers following the help or go back to the previous section concerning basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD was picked up and fetched from FreeDb, all titles are already filled in and furthermore the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; gives a window appears, and you can select the database entry that's your opinion best to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not select the check box for the automatic query from FreeDb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for Settings), if you do not have a local database, but take the data from the Internet, you need access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD editor - input of CD data and title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the 'Update' title ', the remainder of the data in the input field' Album '.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist does not have to be entered in the input field 'actuator title' unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">"" "the lower comment field can be used for individual comments," "" "The comment field of the album" "" "is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD." ""</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful recall of the data from the FreeDb, the CD editor is not blank, but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor (e.g. if all words begin with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment area. if you are using ID3v2 tags, you have set an unlimited field length. this option is set up on the tab card settings. to do this, take a look at the section 'Basic Settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see for help to receive more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry, which is obviously not related to the style of the read CD; for example, this is not important because we will not transmit the & CD. for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are under skirt.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD Editors window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece. simply type the entries for the boxes of the actual piece. the titles of the piece are displayed in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and put the same way until you've entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Caution: this window doesn't appear if you have downloaded the data from the FreeDb. it is already sorted in one of these categories of database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the tool bar. note that the artist and the album are displayed on the list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in before each line of a piece. only the titles which are selected so are selected. a simple click on the line switches on the selection of the piece or then press the button all pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at one time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When clicking on the button select select the read process, this window appears for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what runs out.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab orders to turn on to the window window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the commissions. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message you see if you are trying to work with a coer you still have not installed. pieces which have not been successfully encoded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the target folders are not what we have entered here. have you checked if you have writing access to the folders for temporary files and target folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error has occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. this will start reading and coding parallel. note the status review in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has found no configuration setting to suppress this behavior, the number of parallel processes to read and code. with powerful machines, the result is unclear. the used computer with an AMD64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous interpreting and coding (of course two different tracks).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queue of the body. after the last piece is coded, a small window will be displayed in the top left of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudio files;, you will need & kde; 3.x / 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the encoding of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers which are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General MIDI events are translated into events that understands synthesizers.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map which converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always plays an trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only a soundcard, you do not need MIDI map because all soundcards are GM compatible (including AWE and GUS cards, FM radio and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps. so you have to edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favorite name).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file which stores all necessary settings for the play of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Every section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section which may appear as often as desired. but, for this, each occurrence is a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap"... END Define KEYMAP "An additional keymap... END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END Options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a portion starts (except for Options) and END that the end of a section is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail so I can provide support in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, as the patches of General MIDI as shown on your specific keyboard, the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal mark is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllkeysTo M is used to put all sounds that will need to set the sound with the number M. if your keyboard supports no gun shot (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a gun shot. to do this, bear the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 (the gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which audio is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here, with the term Drum-Patch of Patch, is a different percussion instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;), and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to display how sounds are mapped on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As in the PATCHMAP section the sequence of lines is very important, as their presence. they must create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and every instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to map tones on the perkest-channel. look at the provided keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map a few channels to others. if you wish to replace the first and second channel, you can simply do it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others will need 16 or 9 channels).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 rows, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is shown on the channel N, the keymap is used with the name name for this canal. if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events are ignored, which will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussions-Patch on the perkest-channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio, in which ratio of Pitch Bender events are multiplied with the value n, this will be converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then passed on. the value 4096 is used therefore in the map file no decimal comic.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is used because GM pre-indicates a keyboard that will play a Pitch Bender Event with the value 4096, a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards will try to play two sounds up to one octave up. to try the correct value on your keyboard, you must try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use an MIDI map simply open the MIDI settings dialog. these can be found in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole set of keyboard (one for each MIDI channel). on this keyboard you see which sounds are currently being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. if you have changed an instrument, the button does not display any more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views to display the played tones. the view select in the Settings menu under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace-LCD display the speed which will play a song. the higher the number, the larger the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so, for example, find a song to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that has to be played like a piece of music. it contains the music, the rhythm, speed, & etc. so the same MIDI file can result in two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB, while a mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have compiled a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (e.g. from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't have any desire to add all the files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agreed, that's why & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add to & konqueror; select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, check the setting of automatic adding to the collection. otherwise, files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">Use the arrow keys on the left of the Tempo- LCD panel to slow down playback. to restore the default tempo you can double on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I've been on a & kde; Desktop a & konqueror; -windows with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or toggled (if I want to play a file of MIDI files) or I want to play a file only in the & konqueror; drag and drop the file into the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file only once, without adding them to a collection, turn off the setting of automatic adding to the collection and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. supplement you only want to play the first file. so adjust the setting of automatic adding to the collection and open exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then join also B.mid and C.mid to create and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you so much! when I hear these songs or see the postcard, encourage me to program on & kmid; to program.</seg>

<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, write an e-mail: larch @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You will really make me a lot of joyful anticipation, if you send me a postcard from your residence or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group I will include a postcard or a MIDI file, but if you want to send me a MIDI file, you should contact me as I might already have the file.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A soundcard. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, as the sound quality depends greatly on your sound card. it is not the same whether you are using a FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the playlist. and finally, there is a window window that is displayed only when you are talking about it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections under the menu bookmark, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries, which should be played after each other, you should use the category of permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchy level. if you have an entry, its group will copy and all its subgroups to the current category and playback starts with the associated entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do the files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer, but also by using a category. simply click on a name of a category. simply click on a name for a subgroup. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML contents of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you must select the same with playlist, and select either the editor mode, or select a different category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when processing mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation of starting and running can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modifying [General Options] No Intro = 0 oblige option on '1'. if the option is not available, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate a different animation. & kmplayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / introver.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at starting does not need to be short, it will automatically terminate by opening any other source. this would be disturbing if the user can stop the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the display of a favorite photos; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / h; / h; / h; / h; / h; / h; / h; / h; / h; / h; / h; / h; / h; / h; / h; / h; / h; / h; / h; / h; / h; / h; / h; / h; / h; / h; / bodywork; & gt; / h; / bodywork; & gt; / bodywork;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuration of MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer;. here the path can be set from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the output of mplayer visibly.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback dialog for this playback dialog by & kmplayer; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplaymate. here is a sample like a 'flash' with the swfdec-mozilla game played:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash' can be played within & kmplayer; it can even be used to insert the special field of Embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">With that the & kmplayer; 'flash' can be used in HTML pages, the & kmplayer; module as service provider for the Mime Type application / x-Shockwave-flash in the setup dialog of KDE must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror & & Multiplayer; is stored in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding loading of the browser module library. if there is no error, the backup output is inside & kmplayer; (view, console or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">This should always be a preemptive backend for a particular Mime Type (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manual change of file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon all files will be used:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play on TV cards, either via MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvPlayer). before TV can be watched, the scanner must be used with the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (video data recorders) settings in kmplayer is the dialog in the settings dialog - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; Xvideo port to be detected, from which one is selected (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has contained a DVB-in.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only use Xvideo (probably this kind of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). this is why the videoforlinux extension for the X server must be work. therefore, the XFree86 server must therefore contain the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>

<seg id="1802">When creating a new document, a new document will be replaced by other data strings (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template it is necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by typing in document class. typically, it will be used as a:\\ 'CUE [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {item}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the instructions of the instructions in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, subsequent steps must be accomplished:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, then you can create your own template instead of the standard.</seg>

<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the properties dialoges, the & quantitative aplus; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. tool bars offer a quick insertion of tags in a document without any risk of writing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are not a folder. they contain only the & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders include the name of the describing language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declare whether they are necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible to give other users a better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits will be presented in a simple manner.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but does not contain only one element type about himself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Type of tags is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>

<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and methodology. the arguments that will be handed over to the method. can be empty or% day, that means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container day that contains the elements of a list together. it can occur only once for an attribute description. it is a merely element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of an attribute of an tags within a dialog. this day can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once (for example for each & lt; attr &gt; -day). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Returns the position and size of a field in the dialog. this day should be available for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>

<seg id="2017">All the TagXML files must start with an & XML; -declarations start: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces affect nothing, but look on & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; code &gt; will not cause a leg breaks, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is to start in the & Quantiaplus; window to start and review TagXMLA. another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, verification is performed only during charging the TagXML-files in & quaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; Element from the & W3C; & XML; file name. the filename for this conference XML file should be schema.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2027">This action assigned to this action. with clicking the User button a shortcut can be assigned, with Keiner is the current shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered in the Detect settings and when executing this text, this text is inserted in the document on the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action of action. with the help of this action you can use external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) to use the document or as input (or parts of the document); even the quickstart-dialog or the various See in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced using the current document URL. in case of a local document it will be deleted from the document's name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the running & quantum leus; only one instance is running, the text unique is added to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantum-lus; from the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Parameter for this event, usually the filename of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the indicated methods there can be a script input from & quaplus; at default input can be specified, which can be sent to the default input. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Select text: the selected range of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally only useful.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the issued application can also be diverted. there are two kinds of issue: normal edition, on the standard output; error messages which is to be done with the default output format, given the value the selection field output is set to:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to create tags in logical groups. it is necessary for each group to create one's own toolbar. in the given case it's not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings promotions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self explanatory. press the new action at the bottom of the window starts Edit mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all the required fields and add them to the matching tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the tag has Attributes, and you can plan their use, activate dialog "Tag," when available to entering the use of the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Ignoring! is it a ugly symbol. who should notice the action in conjunction with this symbol? will we replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action represents better, we will use & kiconedit; use from the & kmenu;, Graphics More programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used as standard 32x32 pixel, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">In terms of that the day start, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually interpreted as less, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user is signalized that clicking this symbol will insert a & lt; -day in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action. this happens over the menu with Settings promotions... (in & quantitative aplus;) and selecting the required action. in addition to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the button and continue with other tags, so it still exists, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantum dus; functions to toolbar, or it should set it to better overview by several separate separators into several groups. make sure the tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (top left) for my tool bar. after choosing the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the toolbar item to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to preview quick access to the konqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support grouping. anyone who does not know my tool bar, could believe that the & Conqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new tool bar must be tested by using all symbols, to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back up in the correct folder. after reeXML does not exist, it will be stored in the correct folder, but your tool bar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust your tool bar (s) if a file is opened by the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most mentioned extension of & quaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for scripting language or the formatting language you like. therefore, this chapter explains how to create a & PHP; document tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you might test in & quaplus; reository if someone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc. then you need to create the docrc file. we'll need to send the first part to you, the second we treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc you = pfad, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index page element = your description for such documentations e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Section Section 2 = &gt; 1.html Section 2 = func1.html, 2 = func1.html to Day 2 = Day 2.html to Day 3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree. for example, you can now see in the PHP & PHP; documentation such as:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element = database of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Introduction = Basic syntax = language.basic syntax... basic syntax = language.basic syntax...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the horsetups (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the index is referenced directly to a file (and consistent at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing, but pay attention to & and & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantitative information; resources are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The section section is the range of docrc file which is intended to display the context of context-sensitive help. by selecting the function name and press of Ctrl; H for context-help, the documentation would be shown directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file extension lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of using separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of PHP / PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your file docrc, namely the $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quantum / apps / quantum / apps for local or global use. then create a folder (such as docrc) and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these good and well worth are shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, for example which documentation was used to use the & quantitative aplus; community. they will not be rich, but proud to have worked on the best web developer platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the separating resources (DTEP-packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. at different places there is an e-mail menu entry, like DTD DTD package (DTEP), send the toolbar with Email, in context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all other & quaplus; -users are checked and only available when our team takes them as accurate and usable for the publication, why it uses a GPG / PGP key. thus, the source of resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading you are asked for their private GPG keys (the Passphrase is not saved), or in the case that you have several keys, you can select an input fields (URL preview can be empty) and by clicking OK the upload will be launched.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can also upload from the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbar toolbar, and in context menu of files and folders in templates and scripting tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, nor before installing, & quaplus; the integrity of the resource by review of integrity and Signification. in case of problems it can be canceled. if the integrity are given and the resource is correct, a message appears with the author of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages, which is currently not produced by & quaplus; but it can be time consuming, because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in day XML format. there's easier way to convert DTD to a DTD package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can start from the DTD shop and converting a DTD menu. select the .dtd file containing the DTD description, which should be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Defining line: the character string, which in! Doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / EN http: / / www.v3.org / / EN http / / EN http / / EN http / / EN http / / EN http / / EN / 4.04 /</seg>
<seg id="2080">Adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when activated, brings & quaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>

<seg id="2199">Binary is everything that is not pure text. it can be every file except text, so images, & PDF; binary templates are usually inserted in documents using shortcuts (e.g. photos with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are available in the prestorage space under global templates. more information on templates tree is available in.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally a simple framework for the purpose and organises the work in a corresponding way to be efficient. some examples may be found in the prestorage space among global templates. see in for more information on templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document will always be inserted in the documents from a comment on a template, but the same text area to a complete menu system based on Javascript or Perl. some examples are listed in the prestorage space under global templates. see for more information on templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are for whole sites as templates. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure. there are no examples in & quaplus for this.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File As template as local template.....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, you notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the repository. look at the prestorage space under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document, and click on File As template. alternatively, select the selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be drawn with drag and drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file will only be used in a template file. all file management functions can be used, such as drag and insert or insert the file tree from Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click a folder in the file tree or in the repository tree view to create a folder and secure a name for the template and secure it. by default, it can be saved as local or global template as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very target-oriented advance mode. you can insert header and footer with & PHP; design, insert files or link with them. in addition, you can find some things while using templates in projects very deep inside the eye.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the sub-window templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quantum / apps / Quanta / templates / templates / apps / Quanta / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates. each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">In order to set the behavior of a folder, in the template list with the right mouse button, click the folder and select in context menu properties. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three previously described types; files, text, or templates. this selection is hidden when allied attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and it fits for everything except for common folders. if a regular folder would be enabled, it would be explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, it's probably located in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows to lead or recreate text for templates in this folder. this could be general header or footer for all templates for a particular project, and allows copying contents to a file with special header lines / footer a whole present already with the matching feeder lines / foot-rows.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you will also have a context menu (shown to press right mouse button) using a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source code editor that can be reached via the main menu view. the first mode replaces the source window in two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it charges a document as a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and switch to the source code editor, in which the changes made in the VPL; -Editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor to a document, the & PHP; contains a small green symbol the Vohanditself of & PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editing and PHP; it is still necessary to edit this code editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source code editor and in the VPL; editor synchronously, this mode is already active, and the keystroke to the active cursor from a window to another, whereby the position is retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization gap between the VPL; editor and the source code editor is adjustable via Properties Quanta.... After selecting from VPL, you can automatically choose between synchronization according to one click or automatically. in general, the Recommendation: a small creep for fast calculator and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">If you want to change the title of the website, the editing of invisible tags is possible. thus, the editing of invisible tags is possible, as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; the document serves as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; it can be used following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed. a click into the list enables the change of content e.g. keywords on the name and keyword Key Word on the content -column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS-rules are the new way to create or delete pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS laws using the list below. editing the list is just as possible with the meta-elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS styling template, pressing the file open button and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursors is possible like in a word processing, because of the arrows, possible with the arrows, possible. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted by typing or removed from the button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags in the same way will be done in the same way about the toolbars, as in the source code editor, if an anchor tag is not removed, e.g. if an anchor tag is inserted, it must be removed from the other side anchor day.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparison. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merger was very complicated because one of the contributions made many changes and at the same time changed the recirculation at many places. another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts with merge.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines. and there were no indications concerning the places where maybe only the entry had changed. the merge of these changes was a small mare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences in line and changes on white signs. later, a lot of more useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare it quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function transformed & kdiff3; nearly in a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way cohesion is fully supported. this is useful when two persons are independent from one piece of cod and make changes to the resulting changes. in this editor you can even edit the result. in this editor you can even process the result directly. the screenshot shows three Quell files when assembling:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you to merge and merge the complete folder. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; in the folder format:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& diff3; displays the exact differences and indicate the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often need to check it out, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are visible visible. if lines only differ in certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble when somebody is modifying the recirculation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is equal, and the other differs in one line, the color indicates, which file is different. red color means that both are different to different files.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files are in the same name, but in different folders, then you can ease the typing work by writing only the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 folder Folder 2 folder Folder Folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog allows the manual setting of file names, the selection of the file browser (file...) or selecting an lastly open file from the drop-down list. you will need to specify a third file for next time; when you leave the entry for C, the analysis of differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Over the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the default or merge folders will be selected, for B and C, however, use a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is checked, the input field is active for goal and is not necessarily required to specify an output file immediately. you can do this step later while saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">Setting this setting opens up a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison should be chosen, you can simply close the dialog with the break button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and drop them: simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from one editor and leave it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar to these functions, it would be a relatively large effort. you would need to compare two appropriate files to copy them in & kdiff3; and now you can easily copy, paste and compare these files.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can't remove anything from & to diff3; just drop off text in a comparative window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and removal of text into another program as cutting and insertion (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case, your original data might be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each word window is the info line. the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B, or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (if the path is too long, leave the mouse a while over the line. then a small support window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are associated with letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed via the settings menu).</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, you can see the colour which file differs. if both files are different, the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. this is very useful in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left next to the text, the column is displayed. if differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to only see the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, for example, white characters are only in strings and comments, relevant to the Preprocessor and in few, rare items.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separates the summarization column of the text, where the respective source file has no lines. if the line is reversed, the line appears on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (in the comparison window) also has an information line with the written output:, the filename and [Gechanges] if you have edited the result. normally it contains by the automatic interaction already text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are disbanded, saving disabled!!! (use the buttons to select hard / unsolved / unsolved conflict to find the still remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons can be used, each difference is also a conflict which needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed in all windows. (this group will also be displayed with the color background color for the current area and each appears on the left) a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no further line left through the automatic interaction or by manual editing no further line is left in the group; this text is only displayed in the case that you might change your mind and maybe again select another source. this text appears neither in the final file, nor in a marking you might copy and paste it somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Text & lt; Conductions, however, appears in the clipboard when copying such text from the result window. carefully go with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if choosing the sources to ignore or ignoring C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate with your mouse blades and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard, but you can use the arrow keys on your left, right, end, Ctrl-beginning and Ctrl-end, Siw as you are used by other programs. the oversight column can also be used by clicking here also to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window you can also use the other keys to edit. with the add-on button you can switch between insertion and transfer mode. (default is the plug-in mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes the view of all windows at the beginning of each group (as already explained in the section together and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference (Ctrl-Down / Strg-up), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-up), or to the next / previous conflict, even after the manual solve. therefore, there must be differences between solved and unsolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking in the clipboard, select the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this is enabled, automatically copy the clipboard automatically. be careful with this option, as you could accidently overwrite the content of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line-files are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line-in characters\, and Win32-based systems use car-back insert\\ r\. KDiff3 keeps the line-up of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not with binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically and restored to the next start. (menu setting ungen- &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a script with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides scripts with variable width to choose, but you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you tick this option, differences are displayed in italics. if the selected script does not support this image, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in its pure form, but would be rotated. on these systems the button defaults automatically creates an unprecedented colour.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the tabulator button will be inserted by the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, a tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the recalling line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. manually copy the clipboard into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which Zeilenende type you prefer to store. the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">With the comparisons of files, & kdiff3; first to find all identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters may be ignored. the second step compares white characters. in this step, white characters will not be ignored. even when merging white signs will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a car-back slot '\' at the end of one line, but then you could save files with different sizes in page-on-side comparison, but if this option is activated, but if this option is enabled, this option must be disabled. in default, this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">By default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and related characters are ignored ('0' - '9', '.'). in the result the differences are displayed, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">By default, this option is disabled. changes in comments will be treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively still looking for smaller differences. the option is activated by default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow to very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">As long as the result of the selection is shown, as long as the result of the selection is displayed, this setting will navigate.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Solve automatic all conflicts in white characters as used by the selected file as source. (default setting is useful if the automatic selection also includes conflicts in numbers or comments, if the automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments, when the options are ignoring or ignoring C / C + + comments are enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter to scan the folders and executing a merge. look for details under documentation to directory and merge tracking.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, then the original version exists the suffix. original file, if already a backup file with the suffix is original, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of the user interface. change this option does not affect the current running program. you must finish and restart the current program. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is controlled globally through the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following coding settings can be configured separately for each entry. if one enabled this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for encoding appears a short note what the local coding is. (this can not be modified and has for you purely informative character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted; since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which coding is to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing commands, you might not work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the default application command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the coding of output of front-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch off this to suppress heresy changes in white characters in text or reviews. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring or ignoring C / C + + comments are activated.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode, you'll see only the differences between two of three files. according to the selection of A & lt; -gt; B, A & lt; -gt; C, A & lt; -gt; C, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C will be displayed next to the normal or second oversight column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you'd like to use the available space on the screen for long lines. just take the less important window. (this option is located in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arrange the comparative windows side by side or other. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and decides suddenly to bring the files together. a simple click starts to merge the file, and uses the file name of the last source file as the default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart again, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it is handed over to this external command first. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor, which is exactly your needs. for example, you can use this function e.g. to remove damaging parts or to correct depressing.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is handed over to this external command first. if there is a default application command, the output of the command will only write to the default processor, which corresponds to your own preprocessor, which corresponds to your needs. each input line must have an appropriate output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users wish to program that. good news is that, in most cases, sed or perl suffice perfectly.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this default application command for line input to convert the input to uppercase letters: SED'S /\\ U\\\. *\\\) /\\ U\\\.\\ U.\\ U contains the found text in the first string. the\\ U converts the found text into uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically add value chains (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you can experiment with sed, you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring of numbers is actually a already built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example of a further processing command for line-equal. sed "s / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every character between' and ']' is a hit, and any hits will be replaced by nothing, so it is virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform multiple changes at once. then you can use the semicolon '; you can separate the compositions of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of used you can also use something different such as perl -p -e -e 's / REGEXP / replacement / switch' However, if used\\ (and\\) still needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal Preprocessor are used for viewing and keeping together. the further operations only change the data that the Zeilenabalalgorythmus looks.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal Preprocessor, the Zeilenabis processor-processor is the output of the normal Preprocessor.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessors commands are very useful, but as with each function, the lyrics are altered or differences, you may accidentally find specific differences in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit a lot of files in a folder. this is why you can compare and merge all folders with & kdiff3;</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes for each object a proposal for merging; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the collision and displays the simulated changes without it really perform,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... taking selected actions either with all (F7 key), or just with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparisons and merge of individual files. you only need to specify folder on the command line or in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a basis. if no target folder was specified, uses & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folders.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically, not to merge. to merge the merge, select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you will inform you a small news window about current progress. if you cancel the folder, only the files are listed until then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scan of the folder is complete, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a single mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded down. you can click a folder by double clicking on the + / - or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right. all subdirectories can open and open all subdirectories with which you can open up or open all the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double click a file, the file will be started and a comparative window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folder, it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case the internent action can not be selected automatically, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, the colors are red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries, the colour is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if you are identical to all of the content. then also folder is the same color. by Folders the age is insignificant for its colour.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirtiff. the colours reflect the colours of a sheet, which is only green, then yellow becomes red and later, when it is old, red becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical, but not B: copying B (or B not exists, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copying C (or if C does not exist, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copying A (or if A does not exist, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same datatype (e.g. if a file and B is one file): error: contradictory data types. as long as such faults exist, the interaction can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B not have the same datatype (e.g. if a folder and B is one file): error: contradictory data types. as long as such faults exist, the interaction can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">Mode for synchronising is active when only two folders and no explicit target folders are specified and if the option folders are synchronized. then choose & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not the same are: converging and save the result into both folders. (the user can see only the visible file name for the output file only B; copied directly after the merge & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and the option new file will be merged instead of merge (uncertain) then checked & kdiff3; but if the files are different, but the date will be different, but the date is identical.. As long as such errors are not removed, the folders cannot be restarted.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While executing a file after the other, you will show a file after another, and the merge operation has been completed, and according to other messages, if any unexpected review is completed, you should make a final review, and review whether the status is ok everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog, the file comparison method is selected, KDiff3 will display additional columns. these contain the number unresolved, soldered, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for soldered conflicts will only appear when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You may either carry out the currently selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the Plug-in actions (even in all subfolders), you can start merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not have a target folder, then the three-folder merge mode is used for the two-folder merge, B and / or B will be used for synchronizing A and / or B folder.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you chose a target folder, please check that all entries will be displayed in the folder structure as well. there are some options supported by certain entries. verify these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To perform all entries, select directory entries / proceed in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut abbreviation). to execute just the current entry: select Action from the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If any conflicting data types still exist invalid, a message appears indicating the faults of faulty elements. you can then select a valid promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you merge all entries, a dialog box will lead to options, ejaculate and break.</seg>

<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on an error, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will see some error messages which will help you try to trigger the cause of the problem or solve the problem in another way before you proceed to merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been customised individually, & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and performs it in later. even if the merge operation has been recorded or not saved, these entries will be performed as required. only if you modify the merge operation, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3) now has a section called directory-merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate placeholders are displayed with a semicolon;. valid placeholder * '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folder must not correspond to this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern, are not displayed in the element tree. it can be used more than a pattern. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern, are not displayed in the element tree. it can be used more than a pattern. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignore files that are also ignored by CVS. many autonomous files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be set with a .cvsignor file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a default attribute. in other file systems, a leading point is marked as a file. this option lets you decide whether these files are to be shown in the element tree or not. this option is switched on in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the files will be compared to which the links are shown. this is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is disabled, the symbolic links are compared, if the option is switched off, the links will be handled and recursively asserted. (note that if the option is switched on), the links may lead to itself. (note that this option is switched off and depl3;) This option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">A complete analysis of each file carries out and shows the statistics columns. (the number of dissolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (type a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders through a slow network, it may be faster to compare the change date and the file size. please take a certain level of security. please be careful with caution. this option is toggled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similarly, no real comparison takes place. the files are considered to be the same if they are equally large. this option can be useful when copying the change date. please be careful with caution. this option is toggled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">"" "activating the" "" "Synchronize" "" "mode, when two folders are compared and no target folder will be selected. the results of the merge will be stored in both folders. this option is disabled by default." ""</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merge copying the newer file as an action, the knowing that the other file will not be changed. you should check this in any case.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder will be changed or deleted, the original version will be renamed. if an old backup file exists with the .original extension, it will also be replaced without any other backup. this option applies to single files, not only the merge of files. this option is enabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folders converge are visible to the merge of individual files; you can switch the window divider using the mouse. if you do not want, you can switch the window in the window menu and switch between the two views of the window and text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file easily by double-clicking, but if you want to launch a single file in the directory, without having to save the folder, the file will be set to refund and the file will not be merged again when you launch the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The status of this status is lost, however, when you start reading the directory: menu -Menu: new</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE provides network transparency with the help of KIO-slaves. Kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open, which are based on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has another syntax as local files and folders. a few things you should consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively mund. or.. included. that is not possible with URLs, they are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, vacancies &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file with the name / # foo # die URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes, due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can not be distinguished if a link to a file or folder shows. then a file as a link target will always be accepted. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to process the permissions or change date. hence the permissions or change date from the original. (note that the option is confidential.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently as a difference viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop first always starts the built-in differences viewer. to start Kdiff3, press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally you need & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is used as a part, collects & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file will exist. then, & kdiff3; the patch patch will start to recover the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror you can click a patch file and select from the context menu preview to - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. also, it is unreliable if the original files have changed since the generation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. to merge or the comparing folders is not supported in the Kpart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now heist) is already available. in addition, the name Kdiff3 shows that it can result in like the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL programs for a long time and have learned a lot while I looked into the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers that have gone to this way or go so.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure script to the correct prefix / usr / local but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are first treated as identical, but if only a non-white character is different, the line will be treated as not the same. iF commands to next to each other, this is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor is noticeable for each difference in the files where it begins and where it ends. this important information is lost when the result is simply saved by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C, it is too much effort to design extra a own file format that might save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort was so far too great. you can restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit a large quantity of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text comes suddenly; No src left; appeared and the text can't be removed. what does this mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; use already many colors to emphasize differences. even more emphasis is confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and fault reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="2438">In order to use all the functions of & kdiff3, you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use Kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of recent changes under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">Um & kdiff3; on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of the & diff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE gives you the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">As & kdiff3; autoconf and automaker use, you should not have problems with compiling. however, if difficulties are encountered, please report on the & kde; -mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out the text clipboard (Strg-X or switching) into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert the text from the clipboard to the current curriculum and replaces the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files that are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version you have to reread the folder when updating this options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries are displayed, the differences are displayed. if the target folder already contains these files, they are missing in the target folder. (the behaviour will probably be modified in a later version), this option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if the lines are already present), when the lines are already present, click the button accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2449">This option is disabled by default. undershoot in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager. displays a mini preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to change the running programs to change their size to stop them or move them. this works both inside a desktop and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as those running applications. applications can be selected and even be moved on the desktop and to another.</seg>
<seg id="2452">The middle button of the button can be moved inside & kpager. the motion is possible both inside and as well as other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on: if it is clicked on the empty background of & kpager; click on the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries to minimize, maximize, Desktop and finish. the following commands make the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. appears only if it is clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Send the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears if it is clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If the check box is marked, windows can be moved within the & pager; s with the middle button of the mouse on the desktop and also to other work areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, in & kpager are displayed; the names of virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Checkers of this field lets the & kpager. display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is crossed with name, the names with file numbers will be provided, & eg; 1st place.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in the & pager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the running programs will be displayed as small windows in the & kpager. otherwise only the empty areas are displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple rectangle with the proportions of the program window. symbol shows the window with its standard icon and Pixmap showing a small view of the real program window. remark: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here can be the arrangement of the & pager; the main window will be displayed: classic leaves & kpager; in a 2xn-pushbutton appears, as from Pager applications in some other window managers; Horizontal shows all virtual desktops in a horizontal row, which is very well suitable for presentation on the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display windows as symbols or by their content. it also runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right click on the right button within & kpager. you can set up toggle switches... allowing the dialog to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment this cannot be changed in dialog, but you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or VI. If you have no write permission for the file you need to register as user root or assign to your system administrator. in this file you have to assign the key to windowTransparentMode and assign it to this file. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly being expanded to include new functions. it is optimised for use on powerful computers.</seg>

<seg id="2483">In the default setting, it expands; the area around the mouse pointer is like a moving magnifier. alternatively, you can use & kmag; to show a selected screen area in the larger screen (drop screen mode) or surroundings of the mouse pointing at the screen (eg; on the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid the mouse pointer in the enlarged window, select the mouse pointer, please select the mouse pointer. please note that the mouse is not able to recognize the form of the mouse. this is always the default kde; / Qt; -mouse pointer.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click on the same spot when the mouse pointer is waiting for a while at the same place. it's meant to help people that emulate the Repetitive Strain Injury. besides, it may emulate the pulling with your mouse. this requires a little exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can overcome the pain that comes when clicking the mouse and helps to use the computer without any pain. unfortunately, you can also consult a doctor if you are using your computer, if this is not yet done.</seg>

<seg id="2501">Using & kmousetool; is simple: & chemousetool; monitors your mouse movements and guides a mouse click once you interrupt the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the intelligent move is activated, makes & kmousetool; a break when pressing the mouse button invoked. in this way, you can run the drag of pressed mouse button. in this way, you can run the drag of pressed mouse button. in this way you can get used to make a little exercise, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>

<seg id="2506">When the sound appears delayed, you can go & kde; to do the response time, go to Sound & Multimedia, select sound system and here the tab General. there is a slide-off sound buffer that you can adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times.</seg>

<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, smart shift should be switched off at first. if you get used to automatic mouse click you can later increase the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you are using the audible click, it is necessary to reduce response times from & kde; with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should be aware of what places will be a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral parts of windows or places in the browser window, which does not provide a link, will not leave the mouse in such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse is ckoned, you should clean your mouse. that's usually pretty simple. the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that contact the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to remove the mouse ball. like this happens, mouse to mouse is different. but it should be clear if you notice the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the Loches, into which the ball was inserted. the dirt and the dirt can easily scrape them with a flat blade or the fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system crashes the execution of & kmousetool; if you have just started a move process, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by the slogan of the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you can carry out a mouse click. this is the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you type text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and move the cursor to another point.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there, where you want to place it. but use the mouse on a neutral field of mind if you want to retrieve a key input lag. safe zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray surfaces around the toolbars and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the clever move, but I don't create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Intelligent comparting is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you avoid it. it is very likely to move it into this way to move it into the clipboard or use any other action in which you might need to make the mouse with pressed mouse button. but here are some advice about it:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move, if you just start to use & kmousetool; select text instead as follows: perform at an end of the text area a mouse click and hold the Shift key at the other end of the text, and then press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible cue point. this is by pressing a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the smart move starts. later, you can use the smart move without the audible mouse click. but it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the Xtest extension for & X window; it should be installed on most systems already.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible cue point is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker, and this is correct.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer is distorted shortly. this program was developed for people who suffer from RSI syndrome and to which the weakest of the moist pain is prepared.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured so that it starts a particular time that starts a pulling process before the mouse button starts. in this way you can also pull the Drag and Put with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2729">The easiest way to test the audio selection by selecting. please switch on the map selection, which speakers & tecs to select, select some properties and check how the selection of the speaker has changed. of course you must have set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is uneffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then faster with reading can begin, since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then stop or cancel the text on the map card, even if the language synthesizers do not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal prolimiting filter is automatically set up for the first time. it can not switch off, only removed. change nothing at this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Text-limiting filters compare with a regular expression for propositional and add a tonal sign (decimal code 8) to the propositional limits (tab character automatically removed from the text). note that the Standard-Satzlimiting filter keeps the animation.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (sound), warnings, messages, or the output of Screen Readers.</seg>

<seg id="2740">Please select the properties of the requested speaker here. if this feature plays no role, do not enter any part.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Check this check box if the property should have priority over other properties. you can also set multiple markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in the understanding of the output, this property will rarely use as a priority attribute. the only case you might want to specify the attribute language is provided, if you know that a certain application text is sent in another language than that of the work environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all properties in the field of speakers which corresponds to the nearest to the following, use the standard speaker, and then apply to actors that corresponds to the following.</seg>

<seg id="2803">In most cases drivers will be installed for the network hardware and other devices when installing and set up computers. network appliances will be added later, the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Settings module will be charged if the option is selected at the & controlcenter; when starting the module network settings this, the platform used on the system will be automatically recognized.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to select which the distribution and the release and the release can be made permanently. by setting the network settings this option is automatically pre-set.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing network settings are only possible in system administration mode. before, all options are displayed grey, which means the settings can only be considered, modifying the system administration mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>

<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with a graphic surface can be used like kpackage or the installation tool of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient, but additionally the development packages are required with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended for experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should accomplish this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic networks will be given, in the second all by & knetworkconf; changed configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section may not replace further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix contains only basic information on the integration of the PC into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 does not have a long distribution. from IPv6 it is expected that it is in the near future. this description is currently focusing on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to assign the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, on & privilege; Workplace is the network administrator to address a valid IP address, or if available, the IP address can not be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network the IP address should be chosen from a specially reserved area to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, therefore its use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are usually used in the range of 192.168.1.1 through 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all machines are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called Standard Route that the Second the loopback address (localhost = your own computer). the default route is required for IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The appadress 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface that works like a closed circle.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first goal was to create a surface for tar, which provided the ability of dds2tar for a quick, selective pack. the second goal was to reply to a question that made my wife: how much longer does it take?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be submitted by & kdat; this can be done in three types:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& dat; adds the band back and reads the pretense information of the belt. recognizes & kdat; the band does not know if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; the default index looks for the matching index on your record. can not be found if the index index is to be re-created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Everything goes smoothly, the symbol for the tape drives to indicate that the tape is mounted. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched through the flaps of the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before eject the belt, first integration must first be solved. there are three methods to achieve this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; can be seen through a change of symbol for the band, that the inclusion for the band has been resolved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat; it must be formatted by & kdat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band-type must be formatted before you use to store data. this process does not correspond to formatting with & kdat; this process has to be formatted before using the tape and does not formatting a tape. floppy drives usually don't have a formatting of the belt, DAT drives doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the belt name and the capacity, & kdat; with the formatting of the tape. all data on the tape are lost, the tape is automatically mounted and ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you must select the backup files. that can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in local file tree. it's deleted only this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Check the safety profile in the tree. only the files entered in the profile are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Mark files in local file tree with a tick. only the so marked files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu of Sichenians...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been introduced, the dialog for backup will open. in this dialog you can check once the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you have confirmed the settings, the backup will change. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Mark a file or folder in one of the archives in entry for the drive. it will be checked only the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Mark the files in one of the archives in the record for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>

<seg id="2914">"" "" "" "if you have confirmed the settings for the check, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the auditing process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can create re-produce, the files you are supposed to be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that will be named for the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick. only those files and / or subfolders are recovered.</seg>

<seg id="2920">"" "" "" "when you have confirmed the settings for the restoration, the dialog will restart. this dialog shows the progress in the recovery and the data throughput and the remaining time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the band indexed file using the band content. this procedure deletes all existing indexfiles for this band. you can rebuild the index to two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This will create a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can do the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup should be made. the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the currently selected operating folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under backup files, the files will be backed up to the same file system such as the folder. folder that are stored on other file systems, you can separately apply to other file systems. each entry will be viewed from others regardless of the other file system files.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have been changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file will be backed up since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and create a new snapshot file for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & gt; and lt; files; files were not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings using the KDat menu option... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be done:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / Tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding variant of the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, conveyed & kdat; before the tape is integrated into the drive load. for some drives, this is necessary to be performed before reading or write operation.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched ON, & kdat; to block the cast in the tape, this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, when using the integration of & kdat; automatically use the tape. do not use this option with floppy streams.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched ON, & kdat; the hardware-file size for the tape drives to change. not all drives support variable blocksizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you must inform & kdat; in any case you have to share the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a volume is formatted, writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should cover only a memory block on the tape. the file content is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The band-ID. the format of this string is machine name: seconds, where hostname is the full name of the system, on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds which have been formatted since the era in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file named with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archive which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work, as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users, where you can get information about your system or where the system is stored on the various protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to the example of issues relating to your server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users to understand what makes your computer in the background. is a simplified description of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stored the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog works; experienced users with quick access, for example, on information about problems that appear on their server. & ksystemlog; tries to provide some advanced functions which can be filtered and analyzed by the protocol files of specific programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. among others include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot shows & ksystemlog; functions available, using their help to easily filtering the individual minutes-lines of a protocol file. the individual possibilities for sorting out and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After launching & ksystemlog; first, the main protocol-file of the system - the system Protocol - will open to you, and it opens up instead of its a small message window, so you don't have to run on system administrator. the protocol files usually doesn't have access to read these files normally in the folder / var / log, for normal users.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also filter the filter bar in order to filter the selected filter bar. the list of the log-lines will now be displayed automatically, so that only a log-string is displayed next to the selected filter. in the default setting, the drop line contains only the default string, if in one of the columns the string search string is contained.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select an other entry in this place of course. for example, select the string search string, and then select the name of a process, and carry you in the filter bar the name of a process, so show you & ksystemlog; all the protocol-lines that have been sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled by default and helps you to identify the important minutes lines. minutes-lines of the level errors are displayed with a striking color as protocol-lines of the stage source. the color representation of minutes lines can be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Would you like to display only certain process (e.g. in the system protocol or in cron protocol), then you can look at the process identification (PID) in the process. for example, if you want to inspect the output of a certain command, e.g. to start the samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the option to new lines in context menu of the main window to display all new protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate window windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage an additional window. once you have selected a window, select a Protocol to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has a dedicated website to http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find more current information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, more known (and in the following also called names) as & ksysv; this section guides a couple of concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The System V Init is rapidly developed for the control of program start-up at the system in the & Linux; and therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not continue to take part in historical aspects (for example because I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to carry a machine on System V Init without having a reinstall and reformat. that's why you must make sure that the old init was removed from there, if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are located directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for each system service which you want to start the system or change to another round. system services do not include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things like setserial that is only once started. such views belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie in its part under / etc / rc.d if you need it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something like you have to do something with serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks for different places after the program init and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default value is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably determine that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to modify them, then you can fix / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you want to have something confused, then you can manually start the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder no real files are. instead, every entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stops init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written that it is a argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts out of hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when it contains a K, the script will start with the argument stop. if it includes a S, the script will start with the argument starting.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to set up a simple way of setting machines for many purposes. I could have & privilege; a server-run only, that can run only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc;, network & etc; & kdm;, Network & etc.;</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; you should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or another hand device is simple to not say trivial, simply drag an entry from the field of availability to one of the six rounds to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move the scripts between Runleveling or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else. this will only happen if you pull one entry from the field of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be postponed if you copy them to a new runlevel, you have to explicitly choose from the Edit menu or select the context menu -- even then, if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of a single entry cannot be calculated at times. in such a case you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to add the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is no way to restore entries, which have been thrown into the Recycle Bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different work areas (available system services, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection out- or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another round, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl + X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl + V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of a single entry manually, press the input button to change the properties dialog. select the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the loss of data loss, all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc, if they are available. otherwise they are saved by & ksysv; they will be saved by & ksysv; they are stored in a local cassysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimenting with the standard laptops, and now the machine is constantly emerging. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in a single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default tune to a reasonable value (3 should be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
