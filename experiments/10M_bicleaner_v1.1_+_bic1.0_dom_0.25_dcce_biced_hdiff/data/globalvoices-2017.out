although I visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely great .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , American authors have picked American music and operated his sports .
in fact , this country had a pro@@ found@@ ly deep impact on me that I was mainly used for a American film journalist .
when I was 14 years old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington who played the Gray Gran@@ tham in The Pel@@ ican Letter , the mur@@ der@@ ous con@@ spi@@ racy of an oil @-@ mag@@ nat@@ ter , which was inc@@ lined by the leading federal court with judges who had inc@@ lined his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; freely according to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was like the absolute truth , forget everything else that I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona had only increased my admir@@ ation for the US only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I always said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived whose diversity is so welcoming you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like minded people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I even had a very warmer love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most unusual aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me how he dies with his engines .
he never stops behind the mountain , as it says so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and publicly declar@@ es his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and Women .
nevertheless people on their testimony responded and tuned in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won during the rep@@ ubli@@ can candidate , was the highest number that a Candi@@ date rated by the Party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans to support this big@@ ots , I asked myself ?
I could not make b@@ ump and his voters in accordance with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
as for example , Professor Dr Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the Journ@@ alism program , the people from all over the world , with whom I could maintain myself through Islam and his past .
also , Tr@@ ump &apos;s Welt@@ anschau@@ ung did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current publisher of the &quot; Cincinn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; playing .
Tr@@ umps In@@ toler@@ ant also stands in contrast to gener@@ osity that I experienced at Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought the environment for their lives , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
still , she fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ i , which helped me with patience and grace to help me and my colleagues helped to acc@@ ust@@ om the complexity of American life .
we were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er council helped me much with my career .
these people and those who em@@ bodied in them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump doing his way to nomin@@ ate rep@@ ubli@@ can data , they offered me a stop and counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
it turned out to be , however , that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mainly white , are the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t towards non @-@ white people .
the confron@@ tation with the idea that people were voted for Tr@@ ump , because they were either sharing its rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , because they were ready to over@@ see these things , almost the heart broke .
maybe it &apos;s un@@ fair to call the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as a r@@ attle .
sending people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superf@@ icial and respec@@ t@@ less and imp@@ lies an in@@ ability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their wor@@ ries and fears are not taken into account of the hec@@ tic changes in their communities .
could it be that these v@@ ectors , of which most white , are voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , perhaps they wanted to say that in this America they are still important ?
maybe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick that ev@@ okes the cruel decision to raise a man who look upon those who look different than he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( O@@ B ) : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White against all other Eth@@ nia &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; p@@ un from white in play on the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash ( which means a great Van Jones ) , has just killed this , what America has made so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background you always might have , America is always welcome .
for this country chosen as its President , twice the Son of a Ken@@ nel , whose story how he himself says that nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the choice Donald Tr@@ umps , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : hell with multip@@ licity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the ru@@ e , they say .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier , who fell in Iraq , and what he told on the eve of choice .
on a rally of Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change to the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , Was my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a Place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ ared the crowd .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; if anyone who doesn &apos;t work like you , have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO . &quot;
Mr. Khan ended with words : &quot; God be thanks , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
that &apos;s now Tr@@ ump Land , the news said .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could find no more in this new America .
and that breaks me my heart .

out of the up@@ sur@@ ge to the stars : these Latin American children can &apos;t spoil their love for music by garbage .

what is the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ic city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
that the music , played at both places , has not only changed the lives of children but also a very close association with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby countryside and famous cuisine .
for a few years now La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Music ban@@ de ) plays in the municipality : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , a possibility to overcome poverty in her musical instruments .
a musical school with 100 students will become the central interest for the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the church , which is located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and gangs @-@ violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who launched a musical project and offered a rare occurrence of hope in the youth .
the young band members take their commit@@ ments to the music group seriously , the local press not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty roads to pursue their great passion .
they come always laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the Tru@@ ly you learn day for day trumpet , trombone , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that lies practically on the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay , on instruments which are made of recycled waste material :
music with restored instruments , made of local fixed waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recy@@ c@@ ler has begun under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez to transform parts of waste in instruments .
instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viola , c@@ elli , contra@@ bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all made out of the garbage .
the re@@ pertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ib and Latin American music as well as music by the Beatles , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez is remin@@ is@@ cent of a local econom@@ ist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura at the beginning :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach in the same place the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not collabor@@ ate with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown just what he had never seen before : a violin made from waste .
today there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments of restored footage and is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic &apos;s garbage dump ) shows the musical achievement :
the world generates about one billion tonnes of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
those who live with him and live are the m@@ oo@@ rest - like men in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play from garbage to music around the world .
the orchestra presented his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work successfully fight the illegal fishing industry
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights for wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published in a magazine that reported specifically about international , practiced solutions for environmental issues .
the publishing is done as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing the shared use of content .
in West Africa it was well known that this ship had already been operated illegal fishing in the Western coast before it was the other coast of Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the East African countries were brought accordingly , and little inc@@ lined to welcome a criminal law of this kind in their co@@ asts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the comp@@ ut@@ ors , Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to share one of her har@@ bors and refused to share their fisher@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries , which you simply refuse all &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reminds of Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior executive of the Ken@@ yan fishing agency . he is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was driven out of the region &apos;s waters : it wasn &apos;t succeeded to catch fish there .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for pill@@ aging the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a Network of countries , 2012 from the N@@ RO Stop Fishing Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , members of this network are the six countries who had exp@@ elled the Premier from their waters back then .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight different countries and are working together and work together . they swap for information and move each other while it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of Pe@@ w Char@@ itable State En@@ ding illegal fishing . this project gives F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by definition , is hidden that is hidden because it is extremely difficult to collect . thus , the illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
due to deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , which should be protected by certain habit@@ ats and species , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystem harm that have a delicate balances .
however , while actions against illegal fishing have been hin@@ dered by bureau@@ cratic hur@@ dles , and with the information between different countries , the actions are today in real time with trace@@ ability to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , the individual countries can exchange for example lists existing lic@@ ences , news about suspic@@ ious activity or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspec@@ tions .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive , when they move at the open sea , using satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas . even so susp@@ ects that a ship can suggest that a ship flo@@ ats its caught fish on the way to other ships .
in the ideal case , such investigations may show whether the participating ships have a fish@@ eries policy where they were traveling and possibly even if they have a criminal record .
countries that are opposed to illegal fishing can refuse to accept such ships in their har@@ bours . what means that the ships cannot sell their charge . and that they can even be forced to pay pun@@ ishments , as in the case of Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is considerable financial losses for the owners , which means that the illegal fishing catch is fin@@ anci@@ ally worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Chief Executive Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is an advis@@ er company which sets up for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to return an estimated $ 20 million in lost sales , which lose the eight members of the S@@ ISH @-@ i network each year because of the illegal f@@ ishers who enter Eastern African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies that attracts the region commercial fishing from all over the world . among them is even the same illegal fishermen .
these practices are among other things as the S@@ ailing under false flag , f@@ ake license papers , specif@@ ying fant@@ as@@ ers , fishes protected species and fish in protected areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they benefit from lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weakness of a non @-@ organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ship was illegal and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You should not walk my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and exactly this leg@@ ale lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspic@@ ious ships .
it has un@@ covered criminal networks , distribut@@ ing f@@ ake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships which used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and it has been tra@@ ced and found fle@@ dged ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to its cooperation with Inter@@ pol , international authority to fight crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organised crime &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system which should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to produce suspic@@ ious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will always be developed , also helps to hide the illegal ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal f@@ ishers use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a NGO which is also dealing with fish@@ eries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships switch on for example their automatic identification systems , which they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps to build a system that connects different information levels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ag@@ ro@@ cking ships with greater precision .
a model program
yet F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African countries can actually influence the no doubt global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Maritime conservation organisation Oce@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of the position of each trace@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to collect a better picture with the neigh@@ bors to get a better image of what is doing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w char@@ itable tru@@ sts have to run a similar project when a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities cannot only sense criminal , but also d@@ eter them .
ships that were f@@ ished without license and hardly had consequences , know they &apos;re watched .
according to g@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH countries have a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries , ever since fishing boats have more licenses .
when F@@ ISH @-@ i entered Somalia , Gre@@ ko 1 found out , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow @-@ nets , whose use is forbidden .

&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also have other countries to copy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ ila . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , six countries joined together , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting the illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with certainty , even more such initiatives and structures are to be created in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia was able to report his first major triumph : in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was travelling under false flag . and not only was the ship used without a license and were finally banned we@@ bs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also used in forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time , proof that such a special , collabor@@ ative working method works for the protection of the oceans . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition .

the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the presidency of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela had rejected the request for the opposition to a referendum , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ean refused to react to negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country in the lead by being assembled on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the trace@@ ability of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate will also be led in other parts of the country , among other things in the flat region Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , located in the central Bun@@ dest@@ a@@ at Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the State of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation in the country deteri@@ or@@ ated continuously , resulting in the daily life of Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ean through a acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the sen@@ sing of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately , the absence of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , Contri@@ but@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of the government statement as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis , the annual rate of inflation is estimated at 500 % of the annual financial statements and in which there was a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine , the referendum held its opportunity to rec@@ laim its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the protest@@ ers of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Unit ) , in which the opposition parties had joined the campaign against the majority of representatives of the opposition , which was planned for the election of 2015 as well as a march towards the Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government , will continue to continue supporting the referendum .
the call was commented on Twitter , among others , as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday , a national strike , and on November 3rd all went to Caracas , to the Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace .

images coming from disputes , as well as reports of op@@ pression and abuse .
the news especially struck the news about police re@@ pression in the central city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there , the demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral in order to protect itself according to the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they could leave the cathedral safely , but the protests went further .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ des State T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira bear no skirts , because otherwise you could not see what many national parks do not have !
in the meantime , an inf@@ ographic is already doing the amount of re@@ pression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had question@@ ed the validity of the demand for a counter building procedure in the sight of many by the presence of countless people around the street .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others consider these protests as another step in the fight against a government that made little against the devast@@ ating economic crisis and rather dis@@ covering critical voices . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to join the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentin@@ ean city of Córdoba .
now adult husband said Qui@@ j@@ ano as part of the Great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Córdoba against his father .
the trial concluded on 24 August 2016 , crimes allegedly committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
beginning with the burden , same name as his father to carry up to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
he kept the family secret for 34 years .
in the situation at that time , I thought that was fine .
I felt like a salary .
as a child with 15 years , you do not notice that one is manip@@ ulated by his father .
I could not know that my father was a th@@ ief , a th@@ ief and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ ris@@ er . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state of State was his father from 1976 to 1978 , Deputy Commander of the Secret Service division 141 in the prison La Per@@ la .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the extent of atro@@ cities which he had experienced as a boy , and who told a federal court against his own father .

from the gym to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy , who made mar@@ tial arts .
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are a dick@@ head , you are friends with one of the ERP .
pass just that they will not guide you one day and I must save you then .
the ac@@ ron@@ ym ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , the Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Workers Party of Argentina .
that is why he ordered me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me that I would be a salary .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had moved me .
on the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university clips , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , prop@@ ag@@ and@@ am@@ at@@ erial , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ But the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
during the first and last time he made me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
all this was stolen .
he gave me a little slice of the par@@ cel , and told me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen items were shut down and enter@@ tained me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open room and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured there .
I saw it , and saw a song that became tor@@ tured on humans .
she looked like a bath @-@ bed and metal springs .
later I found that it fast@@ ened to the end of a cable . the other end was fast@@ ened to the body of the person who was just cap@@ tiv@@ ated there .
they led a man with palms to the bed , shot him with water and pursued a charge of 220 volts in the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty wind .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I realized the smell immediately and it became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forgot this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering ?
&apos;@@ i knew that those people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - to the area where the prisoners were bound with palms and to bind them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilian which was also on the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked man were under the face - they were cap@@ tiv@@ ated on hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance ked people quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you know so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me up ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit , and were slain by soldiers .
I know that , because my father spoke at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there , killing and killed .
( according to data from survi@@ vors the civil is Jorge Rom@@ ero , who also was indicted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , with the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Molina ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio F@@ essi@@ a , the leader of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way that you came in here is also the way , where they came here .
when you look on the map , you &apos;ll see that they took approximately the way and have been tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they got a number assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were cast into the cu@@ ad@@ ay , until the arrangement of the top came that they should be laid .
this was the lie - the Eu@@ phr@@ ism - for the shooting of human beings and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war yield &apos;
my father destroyed all kinds of stolen things by home .
at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later in the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I became clear that the spo@@ ils won a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military rab@@ bits that you fought for an enemy .

but when one walks into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... hei@@ ste@@ als , that is not the yield of war but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the head of security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was an officer at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter into a house and steal everything therein .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a criminal , and I answered : and you who asc@@ end cars on the street ?
you are not crimin@@ als ?
he explo@@ ded in rage , beat me and shou@@ ted :
if you walk so far , then I will find you and quickly kill you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else !
so my father was .
I have no only good memory of him .
when I said in the trial , I showed a photo of that , on which I had a jacket and a tur@@ t@@ len@@ eck jum@@ per carried out . both had my father out of La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he brought clothing back home .
at that time , the defence accused me to have been doing a fellow in this crime . I answered no problem , they can put my burden to me what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to test@@ ify .
&apos;@@ the van@@ ishing of the body is the last ab@@ om@@ able act .
now where I am older , I feel repent@@ ance .
I have children . if you only have children , one can recognize the value of a life .
one develops and realize that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
so well , you did exc@@ use humans during the dictatorship . but why do the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why do children kid@@ nap ?
one day my father gathered a girl with his home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have been easy to put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why do their bodies disappear ?
did these people not sympath@@ ize with families , to whom you could deliver their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the bodies is the last shy act , which one can do to a man .
my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they brought machines to eliminate the remains of prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and no idea . no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something is of course always .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you killed men ! &apos;
just to declare it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was with the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the thought to view my father was born during a meeting , when he was under house arrest .
I gave him proposals for all the atro@@ cities which I had to experience on his account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt like falling down and asked me why all the crowded patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly def@@ endant , were really good .
then I shou@@ ted :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed men !
you have committed dre@@ ad@@ ful crime , and you were comp@@ elled to participate in a child .
he only rep@@ lied , &quot; then I will shew me . &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I paid the first ad .
finally , I realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can pre@@ dict that I am a pre@@ set . I have never said my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest standing still before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including heavy , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of freedom in 158 cases ; torture in 154 cases , torture in 98 cases , torture with subsequent death sequence in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of one under 10 years of age .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the order of the judgment of the judgment .
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 crimes against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 Now for crimes against humanity , the Court found guilty of crimes against humanity . the Court has custody in 28 cases , and in nine cases case of liability was between 2 and 14 years . in six cases the acqu@@ itt@@ al was put on release .
eleven of originally 54 accused died during the trial .

all the def@@ endants were members of the military during the military , including former military personnel , former police member and civil co @-@ workers .
Piero De Mont@@ i was kidn@@ apped along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Court of jurisdiction is a historical milestone for all human rights organizations who have worked for years for justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , a lawyer who was founded in 1995 by H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who was killed or murdered during the dictatorship , said :
the trial took more than three years , but research took 39 years .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error in a center in K@@ YO@@ TO , where one can pro@@ long his driving licence .
the photo was spread in the social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend his license to become a very mis@@ erable translation in the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a shield the Japanese word of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; was fal@@ si@@ bly - but perhaps also with bad back@@ ups &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the input area and in the building itself .
processing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared in the social media .
the mistake was the translator Julian Holmes , a inhabitants of Ky@@ iv . he was also that the local newspapers dra@@ gged her attention .
the daily newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote in Kyoto :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city as Kyoto is simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holmes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the f@@ law@@ less English translation was first removed . the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Loop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture are ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation mistake . furthermore she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had been tested by trans@@ lat@@ ors and that the translation was not tested for their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows by the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sorry that older people felt ins@@ ulting by the in@@ adequate proof ( translation ) for our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News put a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ ounced as an un@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the operator of older drivers , which are nation@@ ally involved in accidents , is quite a concern to concern .
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 from a total of 19.@@ 460 hectares of sen@@ iors were created in 2005 , which corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors 1,@@ 80@@ 3 were caused by a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
so their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents fell in total , the proportion of sen@@ iors caused accidents in the same period has increased .
the repor@@ tedly non @-@ named repor@@ ters published in the release of the article comments on the light which show , which pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese apparently calls against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo through the translation error has among others received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible driving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; Does the translation work correctly , or not ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no few such comments .
why is En@@ gr@@ ish so widespread in Asia
translation errors are widely distributed in Japan and in Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true discovery for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo of Flickr @-@ users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
to commit , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text and to transfer active language skills to get him in the target language .
the latter requires the active dom@@ ination of the target language - something which is in the case of mother@@ language . in general , the belief that trans@@ lat@@ ors should be - not in the language language - native speakers .
a French native language should translate for example from English to French - not from the French to English .
photo of Flickr @-@ users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a native language which might be translated into English . this may be due to lack of understanding , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers that can learn Japanese .
some companies , who don &apos;t have a foreign employees , have translations to pe@@ er themselves . then the Japanese staff , whose English skills are being applied as the best , no matter how good or bad the language skills are really .
photo of Flickr @-@ users Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ ying and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences which are produced by machine translations will show that this technology can still lack a human trans@@ lat@@ ors . this applies especially to some languages .
some of the strange English wording in Japan , among them also the av@@ oc@@ ative re@@ prints which are often called t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for sty@@ list@@ ic reasons - not read or understood .
photo of Flickr @-@ users of Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors do not seem acceptable or at least harmless . but of big companies or by the government who have the means to ensure greater standards can be expected more carefully .
the city of Kyoto uses a serious source of translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cen@@ sored measures taken on the internet and on television
main page of the port as &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y So@@ c@@ ie@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users found that they wouldn &apos;t have access to the online channel Viv@@ op@@ lay .
other users later wrote that the websites of VP@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV have no longer available .
other online broad@@ casts also over@@ contributed the protests of the protests in Caracas , who were organized by op@@ position@@ ist groups who oppos@@ e the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was bound , and recommended the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that the Internet sites of Venezu@@ el@@ an Provider are locked again .
that is from the page of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet sites , especially in times of un@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media has been re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant since 2014 on the coverage of protests . at that time the Commission threatened them with money pun@@ ishments and closures if they continue to report about the demonstrations , as the Commission looked upon this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call for violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative National TV channels , I have registered for @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of so@@ das .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ in@@ tro confirmed that not only Viv@@ op@@ lay is not accessible through a blocking of the domain name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its sessions .
former research of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had yiel@@ ded that the local Internet providers may use DNS . this is a technology that uses certain domains of certain domains .
when a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds le@@ fla@@ wed or ref@@ uses the request to call such a website .
we confirm DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ VP@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at VP@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , the transfer was closed on Thursday , April 6th , when the VP@@ IT@@ V camera team Elvis Flo@@ res , who had recorded live in Caracas , was taken into custody .
Flo@@ res was defeated , while he was in police custody .
eight hours later , he was released , and VP@@ IT@@ V went on stream .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also been reported to regul@@ ate Internet connections : thereby , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ean access might continue to make access to multi @-@ media coverage of the current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls will become a slave to obtain an apprentic@@ eship
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ ad@@ ita as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina fought for the rights of children and g@@ athers witness statements of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report by Kur@@ haus , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series called &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , which is edited and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where they had@@ n &apos;t lived together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her studies at the University she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house full of pride spoke about them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one who has become something has become , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she became ten years old she started working as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a big family with little money handed over her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , abundant family . in exchange , the child gets food , training and a roof over the head .
but what is not mentioned , however , is that the children cannot afford countless days of house@@ work that can never be paid and victim of abuse and abuse - and all this in the context of a contract that cannot be cancelled .
this practice called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas -- above all young girls who are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ oni@@ als , resear@@ ched and p@@ iti@@ ated .
she tried to name things by name , for the feeling of gratitude which cri@@ es the cri@@ m@@ itas , keep silent in general .
&quot; cri@@ b@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
there is one hand the family who will complete their daughter in the faith , that they can complete their training their position in society and make something out of itself , &quot; rel@@ ates to another family .
on the other hand the family who increases the girl from himself and just@@ i@@ fies the exploitation by the belie@@ ving that she would give another chance , who wouldn &apos;t be star@@ ving .
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is har@@ assed , his family will learn about many years later .
sometimes they even never know about it .
in January 2016 the previously unknown phenomenon was held , which takes place in the secret in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of strong pun@@ ches . soon , she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military personnel , Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an officer at the registration office .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3.000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of As@@ unci@@ on , the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira was defeated , as long as a stick on Mar@@ ín , until they suffered fatal injuries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they affected us that the murdered child was Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organisations like UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela , who were deeply rooted in the par@@ agu@@ ian society , is responsible for the death of the girl .
they described the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest r@@ allies and demanded that there were no further Carolina in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a be@@ amed up .
without the papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without the official documents , it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neigh@@ bors of the married couples and almost 60 civil society organisations required a rapid investigation on the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who had been sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is found before judgment .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas are explo@@ ited not only as labour forces , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k in which her father worked , bank@@ rupt@@ cy had to sign and her father lost its work .
their brothers had to go all work and began to sell cand@@ y on the road or on the market to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked in the house of their employer between four and six hours every day .
in doing so , they had to divide the time so that even time for learning .
she rose up at five in the morning and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
Fri@@ days for example , cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished furniture and the infected ground .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time for learning .
the more they finished with learning , the more free time she had .
but this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had to never be hungry , but I didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to take more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; she reminds her .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the owner , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a Liber@@ al Party , a Liber@@ al Party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at some evenings the homes of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belong to him and to be read by opposition groups such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he tried to persu@@ ade them to give faith to the reports of the official media on the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he kept her for intelligent , but did not enter@@ tained himself with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the house had found someone who heard him while speaking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they failed to visit my family often , because they were in mind that I would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; thus they supposed that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of the Guaran@@ í , to the house again their native language Guaran@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they had allowed the education that they had allowed to lose once again , explains .
but she was absolutely clear that she had paid for everything she had paid by them with their hard work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was disc@@ rimin@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing that almost never is spoken about , bul@@ lying and the ch@@ ic@@ anas are exposed to the school when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I could not invite anyone home . I had no circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in time , where friend@@ ships , I felt particularly clear that I did not belong to any group .
the isolation was worst of all , &quot; states Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the Company appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group that can be shared for cleaning personnel and children &apos;s ma@@ ids in Paraguay .
the administ@@ rators of the group is Pep@@ a Kost@@ ian@@ ov@@ sky , a city portrait in As@@ unci@@ on .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
for learning .
please report to you .
starting on Monday , if possible .
the ad got five &quot; likes &quot; and many comments .

Bill W@@ rite the Egyptian users to social media to sign up with the government

six@@ ty Egyptian parliamentary group recently agreed a bill to regul@@ ate the regulation on the use of social networking .
if it is assumed by the Parliament , user workers and social media must register for social media in Egypt , to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law there would be a place to be commissioned to share citizens and citizens to share social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with acceptance of the law , users would have to register with their right names and staff numbers , in order to make use of social networks .
if it failed to do this , this could bring a penalty up to six months of imprisonment or a fine of fine of money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bill , consisting of six par@@ agra@@ phs , is defined in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any application that is running over the internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video direc@@ ting and text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced , as the draft may not impos@@ e an indication of how Egyptian authorities should not register the registration , which is not clear in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ar , Member of the Legisl@@ ative and Supp@@ orters of the Legisl@@ ative Dec@@ ree told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user names and users received a username and password &quot; by the fire@@ wall , which is blocked Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning a fire@@ wall at the national level around Facebook . due to them it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network .
but it has not yet been known that such plans exist .
experts from local experts are scep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y R@@ ao@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German , &quot; German Research Technology &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt heavily on technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they ra@@ viol@@ ate physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them serious , then it means that they will apply a powerful monitoring system to filter out citizens who are applying for a permit or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to a judi@@ cial process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be approved as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legisl@@ ative committee and the const@@ itu@@ ary commit@@ tees prior to the plenary debate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his acceptance and en@@ forcement is successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military reas@@ oning in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no different nar@@ ration is present on the image area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says R@@ ao@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill of Cyber @-@ Crime in which a life imprisonment for those who were accused of threat@@ ening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

high above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the veter@@ in@@ ator H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq work to protect the spirits of Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of Leop@@ ards that ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia are among the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are found due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they always find less loo@@ t .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; how Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the Persian le@@ op@@ ard the only remaining rob@@ ber@@ y in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and the de@@ generation of the ecos@@ ystem depends on that a big pre@@ dat@@ ory is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in fact is small and goes against zero . therefore , when the team in the video indicates they have a photo of a great cat in camera body , Raz@@ a breaks out of pure joy .
as a trained biolog@@ ist , Raz@@ a shows passion@@ ately another side of their country , which consists of not only war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies for wild animals and educational programs by Nature Iraq for six years .

in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , the progress made for the north of Japan , had been achieved to re@@ build the life of those who had been affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and one at@@ om accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in S@@ end@@ ai , which was in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a weal@@ thy pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring Flo@@ wer@@ ies Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate , since the ts@@ un@@ ami had lost whole coastal cities from the map .
in this way , Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened at a nuclear accident which alone had to leave their houses 160 000 inhabitants .
the special report of K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows the progress made by six years later , to re@@ build the lives of local residents .
the comprehensive report of the newspaper includes both the Japanese Re@@ pro@@ vement Authority as well as the survey results of those concerned themselves .
the accommodation facility in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts ( in the ground , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) was delivered in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
with the biggest success under the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able , where 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were finished .
I@@ w@@ ate has finished 75 percent of such houses whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima forms the final light to Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
even six years after the disaster , however , we ende@@ av@@ oured to evacu@@ ate six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated from per@@ ry shel@@ ters ( in the one , Cau@@ se@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) to settle into defin@@ itive buff@@ ets .
after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw forced to live in per@@ ry shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people still lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such accommodation .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated out of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergen@@ cies , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was successful . more than 75 per cent of the evacu@@ ated ones that were hau@@ gh@@ ed after the disaster in besie@@ ged places were res@@ ett@@ led in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the figure is 34 percent here .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by the mis@@ fortune , have opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later the industrial reconstruction is much more difficult in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
while nearly 100 percent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , Fu@@ kus@@ hima opened its operation only 30 percent of the fishing ports .
ts@@ un@@ ami and atomic accident involving the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land have grown large areas .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of his farm produce , with only 66 percent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the atomic fact that only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed grounds of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are currently in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nuclear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures tourism has largely recovered , but here Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains un@@ defeated .
the tourist tax in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back up to 90 percent on the same stand as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , however , can only exhibit here only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that since the disaster has almost half the coast @-@ inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood .
is the native people prepared for the next great earthquake ?
in order to be able to establish a whole picture , the paper led a number of question@@ ings among the native population and under the evacu@@ ation . they asked them about the status of reconstruction and also how their emp@@ ts@@ un@@ ami resulted in the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in their introduction of the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population in experience .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures taken to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents say that still not enough for cat@@ astroph@@ es prevention .
as it stands about those who had been evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture .
in its issue on the occasion of the anniversary of earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has also strengthened its attention to the location of evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima had to experience only the massive earthquake and devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened also witnessed the worst , cat@@ astroph@@ ic accident that Japan had to experience .
of 160 000 evacu@@ ated out of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were transferred outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23 000 people were moved back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , and permanent substitute houses have been res@@ ett@@ led .
after 2017 , still 40 000 inhabitants live in Fu@@ kus@@ hima off the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
in the cat@@ astroph@@ ic regions most of the evacu@@ ated areas are known in hausen , older than 50 years old . you must find in proper accommodation , because the efforts to build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima will compete with massive construction projects , which will be part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
if people encounter@@ ed people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
after a while , however , one often recognize that a more one appears as it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important since they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces to expand our perspectives and remember that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Podcast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we treat subjects that often get fewer attention as they deserve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with anyone about language and country borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Veron@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ ana E@@ gher@@ man declar@@ es how a hike to music has taken the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care unit . last Friday , a police officer ended him at a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nationwide , millions of protest@@ ers took part in a protest against savings .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , student of social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on this Saturday and now moved him into an artificial Com@@ a .
its condition is considered crit@@ ically .
the local photo@@ journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus that quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
in the pictures , also the face of the police officer is to recognize that with a striking strike . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident recorded the military police in the Brazilian federal state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the investigation by the active service .
the photos show the police officer , as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with its impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officers were beaten and landing on the intensive station , his face would be on television for six months and the entire op@@ pression would just@@ ify it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a press channel of Media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , given that by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z recorded the video on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officers and hur@@ ry several plumbing briefly on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another video featuring the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also sur@@ faced in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus on the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus living in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ lians Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euros ) to cover a part of the costs for medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia during which he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado uses further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political force . here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me was assass@@ inated by his father , because he was attacked the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked by a police officer , who has hit him with a striking mass .
police sur@@ fers
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to brutal police operation on Friday .
polic@@ emen put in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where protest@@ ers had set up a stage for speakers , rubber floor@@ space and lac@@ ri@@ ots .
the dep@@ uty Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Treaty ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police via loudspeaker announ@@ cements on violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media log sp@@ ade away by focusing on another unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ist : a window disk .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically through a broken glass window to illustr@@ ate the title pages with a photograph .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a bus set on fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic ground , more on a broken window disk than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a specific matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this must be recognized also , if it is strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even here , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets absurd , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate significance , and the typical violence of the military police are mis@@ sil@@ enced by the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; along with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Vill@@ ages of the In@@ sur@@ ge For@@ gotten Vill@@ ages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Act of Á@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar cane plants in Cuba formed the doors ( photo : Julio B@@ atist@@ a ) .
the People &apos;s Community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - well , regardless of that there is no significant sugar @-@ harvest on @-@ site .
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane mill were l@@ ame .
after obtaining the sugar cane industry in the region sil@@ ently , and the factory lost and after its installations , until only the framework of steel and concrete was left .
approximately 272 workers had to invent themselves .
some changes the job .
others sign and comm@@ ute each day to the factories that still war@@ ns .
N@@ ene , a soldier @-@ v@@ ase that stands up at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not bol@@ ted its sleep .
he heard that there are in operation in the east of the region sugar cane mill , which are in operation after a long in@@ active time because they were received .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene is remin@@ is@@ cent of having heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would get the sugar cane mill , but that promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced quantity .
the news would have been a motive for the land some decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests have no more news .
why has the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old rail path of the church saw already better times .
( photo : Julio B@@ atist@@ a )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : 155 sugar cane plants were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive they became un@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production reduction was 4 million tonnes .
it only allowed the factories that produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.0@@ 3 euros ) .
the solution for the unemployment ?
the mot@@ ifs , which led to such measures , were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price increased from approximately a decade ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; between 2017 and 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os must remain , according to the 2016 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agricultural Cent@@ res &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the Agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the current production would reach the 2001 level ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the gross sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go down in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o during his speech on 21 October 2002 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years the still laying of 98 sugar cane factories came , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for continuing education .
the same happened in the sugar cane of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 . may 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene appears as a soldier , is known about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeatedly , &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down .
to get the place , they formed a full@@ time -@@ working group .
the first letters began to arrive before the first next year .
it was officially recognised documents that would only be removed in case of the parts , which would be removed , addressing the address , and the date .
they were all signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was over and the letters came more and more common .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was in charge of the factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that was still in operation .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 year old , is waiting for retirement in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved with his will at the feeding of the factory , whose construction he helped .
with every part which he removed , he showed one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial sectors of Cuba and most important workplace producers has been extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for working conditions and services generated by the municip@@ alities in which they found themselves .
we will never know whether during the Mamm@@ ut speech of 21 October 2002 , which then saw the former president in the eyes of the present persons , when he guaranteed that for five years , their factories were no longer in operation , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane mill
since 2004 , sugar cane is only extracted by Mah@@ len .
( photo : Julio B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years , the People &apos;s Community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things will change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane mill was closed , or better said they began to con@@ front them , they also stopped to paved the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they have been given to spare parts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without the perspective , many young people also left the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve for the supply of the church .
the ruins of the factory behind the new facility are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und forty har@@ vest@@ ing bring to old soldiers a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o a month to spend the years retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin color , small , with a few teeth and clear@@ er voice , is no additional person , nevertheless he gives the lies that you told him not .
they tor@@ tured him for ten years .
N@@ ene deals with 65 years in pension , not because it is lacking in force , but because he is ver@@ bit@@ ing .

first Nations Youth Make hip @-@ hop to express yourself and get their own culture
recording a song by &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
young people from First Nations Communities in all of Canada deal with topics that are important for them . they do so with Hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a number of traveling workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour since 2014 , workshop manager mobile sound studios directly lead to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agogue David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec in ten Cre@@ e Communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hip Hop Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop thus increases the young participants in convers@@ ations like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cultural identity , speech , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or whatever the meaning of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
as the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize a similar workshop with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , said the history of Highway 16 , also called &apos; Highway of tears , &quot; a street section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video game to medi@@ ate how important the receipt of traditional S@@ itten and Prac@@ tices despite the influence through glob@@ alisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young@@ sters did not always rule the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation is recorded , the chor@@ us will be sung in Cre@@ e .
the young@@ sters involved here received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ age Hip Hop Group who gave them a verse in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ scription , also a translation into English which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel , I wouldn &apos;t ever be interested in myself
but I &apos;m trying to go on earth my days
this is the day when you will get our cry
because as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will be lev@@ y one day .
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and also lead our youth
thus , they can do that for what she has given the Creator
in the comment part , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also provides a contribution and adds the st@@ anza to Sil@@ k &apos;s inscription ( which will be published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
plastic dishes in Japan are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant of plastic dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , they are displayed near the entrance to the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; National Models of courts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of each dish who will be served in this restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers will see these plastic dishes , and decide whether they enter or go on to the restaurant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi neighborhood is a variety of these small companies that can just produce plastic dishes , documented by German filmm@@ aker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they do not ask them once more . a new trend is now transformed into show@@ y cell accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
with Na@@ ver Mat@@ ters the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ u .
now in the special sale : new plastic coating created with plastic coating , as they can be found in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed to kit@@ sch@@ y collectors , such as in this case , fridge magnets :
here are a few sho@@ ots in fridge magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in essence is increasingly difficult .
in this case a ka@@ ans @-@ don ( a popular bowl with seafood ) is turned into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phone support .
this part is also made for the Tokyo Exhibition Centre .
and here is an apple , holding your mobile phone :
designed to view like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comfort .
some mobile phone support and mobile phone designer allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping which is served with white rice .
some users had their doub@@ ts on Twitter :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic courts can also take a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form , for example colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant to surprise .
our latest phone stand has the shape of mel@@ odic ice .
moreover , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and Hand@@ y@@ ards from dried salmon .
further sk@@ inn@@ y plastic dishes can be viewed under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # 1 &apos; .
if you like to know more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you insight into the district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the supply of restaurant industry . as for example with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project summar@@ izes the stories of the survi@@ vors of the struggle against the organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against the drug traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; in reports of national and foreign media on the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico the most mis@@ erable and killed regularly occur only in statistics . however , these mirrors are not reflected in the extent of the human tragedy that this battle ensu@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , chief of the Sin@@ al@@ oa , pushed the stories of the conflict entirely into the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the gri@@ ev@@ ing or the churches which have learned to live with pain .
behind every stage , behind every bone structure in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , their w@@ ounds may never be healed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico formed the digital project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dealing with drug traff@@ icking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) which told these victims and stories of people who were in the battle between the prosecution and ant@@ it@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime does not only fear us to our lives .
the effects are far profound .
for example , when doing business , because they are threatened by drug traff@@ ick@@ ers and whole churches to travel so many kilometres to buy something like milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear changes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells us these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who is looking for secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost their father &apos;s four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two her ne@@ phe@@ w , at only one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priest : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today again to the task that we have asked for , and go to graves after the people who have loved us to seek . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son means Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked at an electric shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never returned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment she has no in@@ comes .
you are paying the insurance of my Father , but she does not pay them out because they demand a death certificate .
where should we get that ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editors of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Apr@@ ender a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explain why the project is so important : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to show the faces on those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts which show frag@@ ility and stat@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories from readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central @-@ Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , whether in which form it occurs :
I have been aware of illness and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism now for several years .
I pass daily newspaper he@@ aps every day and see the cover pages with images which can only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or files from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is interested or sad . it seems like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to the body .
I cannot be in@@ different or considered to be normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year @-@ old C@@ ousin also thinks that he is big ( German : drug traff@@ ick@@ ers ) if he is great . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of the perpet@@ rators , if they go through the streets .
for me it is , as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who are afraid of them too .
I see our weakness , when stories are to be exposed in a statist@@ ic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of the human being is incredible for me when death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring place just@@ ify that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; infl@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to spare the trage@@ dies that they are spar@@ ed away from such trage@@ dies when they don &apos;t stir and quietly .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the Capital district : like a family with threats made from her business , &quot; she describes how armed crimin@@ als suffered money from her business until the end of the year not only the business was destroyed , but also their family torn apart .
you think about everything you lost and about how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain in it never passes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again , if you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we walk from each other , the better .
she closed her report with words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you do not know when they will dec@@ eive or kill you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I asked myself in these fear@@ ful days to dissolve my deep root feelings , but the answer is no , for I have forgotten how to we@@ ep . I must learn how to live with pain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of Viol@@ ence drawn Generation . &quot;
in the Introduction he casts questions on how : who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he told that he had to teach himself how to make a egg , cooked potatoes , eats , tort@@ illas and &quot; ch@@ ich@@ i &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the vial with water , sugar and milk powder .
he talks about the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ utter@@ able for a boy who has to learn all the lives of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years earlier , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody body of his father saw that by armed men of a passing car had been shot .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as a violence caused by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of mur@@ ders according to the Federal Council for Public Safety and Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the public pro@@ secutor had 3@@ 103 k@@ ill@@ ings . this corresponds to average 8,5 Mor@@ per per day .
these are only some of thousands of thousands of stories that leaves the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
few stories still live in view of the new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; in 2015 , Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico formed the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co , whose aim is to depic@@ t the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traff@@ icking , who has tor@@ tured the country in the last four decades , in a simple manner .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by the Flickr @-@ user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this entry and the pages about which it linked , contain pictures , on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment in which it is going to raise a rum@@ our , or un@@ masks a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but what is the year after di@@ pped the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether real or un@@ true , will tend to exist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident at seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first publication , it was used to alle@@ vi@@ ate trage@@ dies that have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this false p@@ airing of image and event - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; false description &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - deny not the fact that there are rich@@ ly careful reports about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is questions about our longing for images on messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tank car crossed the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , rose and explo@@ ded . 230 people came to life .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglec@@ ted and devast@@ ated . the roads in the region have become dangerous to dangerous paths that were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , the road tan@@ ker fell victim to death .
the Government of Administration is described by a fire@@ ball , dozens of houses including a cinem@@ as nearby which was full of people who illustr@@ ate the World Cup .
houses are ro@@ asted and c@@ aved cor@@ p@@ ses scattered in the streets .
many people were burned for ignor@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of preview this day form the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; horri@@ ble scenes of this day &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of cavity placed on the floor , while they are viewing on the floor while they are viewing .
but the story does not end here .
over the years the same photograph has been supp@@ lic@@ ted several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , although real , but not in connection with related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what and what not happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote areas of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dra@@ stically from atro@@ cities , in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and cor@@ p@@ se were in streets and bus@@ hes .
reports were taken , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one was back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one inhabit@@ ant on Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were carved , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite photos the following was depicted .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt to win the B@@ oko Har@@ am ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo as proof for the fact and possible mag@@ n@@ itude of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris for two days .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the images from the DRC has been documented only in a number of mis@@ ex@@ ams ; Africa Check has been document assign@@ ments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was taken into account as a voucher for measures .
yet another step further teach personal comments such as the DR of DRC with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments .
the image from San@@ ge came to appearance with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash , published by the United Nations , those who could escape hits , ra@@ pe and some dead , some through burning .
while others reported on violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Post@@ s reported as the following to summar@@ ize these descriptions with photos from the DRC :
this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab news page , which claimed , that President My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ an being said , mon@@ ks and politicians had participated in the assass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition she had used the picture from the DR Congo to report this information .
the original contribution , which was accessed by April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations , the AF@@ P as their source , had also w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly referring to being such a statement , but had not brought the picture from the DR Congo to this statement .
the worldwide operating range of false information
trace of this false coupling subsi@@ ded to the years 2011 and 2012 and indeed come from all over the world .
using a &quot; reverse photo search &quot; you can see how far more information can exceed .
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ y@@ has found 3@@ 44 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures which are very similar to the picture taken in the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ h of private pages , platforms of social media and community and national publications , and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have re@@ directed false reports , have tried others to dump the counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have bor@@ dered the examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and associated with the respective countries on which side they had been published . thus , we want to be more significant than by language alone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several examples listed in the listed countries ( which were also linked in some cases ) may originate from ab@@ u@@ sive use .
here are some cases that can now be fully collap@@ sed ( on the card in orange ) :
map : News frames .
examples of false cou@@ ches of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries indicate pages or servers , which are still available through the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ tering .
the countries in grey are examples that are available according to the metadata and information that are available through Tin@@ y@@ Eye , probably due to f@@ eit@@ ful examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma @-@ Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Alg@@ erian and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims . &quot;

La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica quoted as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( whereby it is not known whether the original report contains the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ wit@@ ter@@ entries after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , like this one , used the image from the DR Congo to illustr@@ ate the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; have seen clearly no sites like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster that refu@@ te this . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Malaysia offers two extreme examples of mis@@ use the image from the DRC , with one hand a twe@@ et , sympathy opposite the Nig@@ erian massacre , and on the other hand of a blo@@ gger , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being persec@@ uted , as the photos were ab@@ u@@ sive because of it .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar &apos;s government published a judge on what it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ately united news and photographs related to international media , international human rights organizations and governments &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in an attempt to create mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings in Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this post , dedicated to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , reveals that the picture of the DRC does not show Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page showed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ an being imposed in 2012 was that mon@@ ks and politicians have been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from San@@ ge .
the article has been updated in 2014 and currently it is included in this publication .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article of 2014 about students , who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the now deleted news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly stated that the picture was not from the k@@ ill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar d@@ ope &quot; attack .
when the picture was later placed in circulation by the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were links to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ fer@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world is asleep ) .
the picture of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dissolved a discussion among Muslims after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities possessed these events , the mut@@ ually in the name of Islam , a major attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was done as proof of the mass@@ acres of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times of ret@@ we@@ ed ) , but the messages that were associated with it were taken in no religious context .
instead , the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage in comparison between Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Father Juan Carlos Pascal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Nig@@ erian massacre , there were some discussion forums like this in Vietnam@@ ese and explained it to a wrong review . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Pascal was dis@@ soci@@ ated by the Embassy in which the DRC has been present .
there are further confirmed examples of a faulty use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
with other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( from the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ y@@ also has not completely trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time@@ stamp / date stamp exist on the cra@@ wler and isolated them in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the image may ultimately bear a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or access@@ able .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( frames ) that cover these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in terms of larger discussions on the silence of the killing of Christians through Muslims or - to the defence of Muslims - the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second frame is used to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
religion , and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth considering how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer give faith to these pictures .
with social media , there are zig people who have been looking for a proportion to tr@@ ise water around a tragedy .
sug@@ evalu@@ ates this mood of mis@@ - and fal@@ tering , that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and lubric@@ ate the real hor@@ ror of what is actually done in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the spread of massive images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ hold pictures of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even requested by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that for@@ ci@@ ble pictures readers and spectators des@@ elect and feel the ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( such as this study , the investigation , such as violent media influence others ) .
while there is something regarding for@@ ci@@ ble represent@@ ations in the news media , the fact is that it is essential for today &apos;s news coverage .
Techn@@ ologist also experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; they will thoroughly re@@ think about the situation where a picture is somewhat sug@@ ary , which actually can be used from the context or on completely mis@@ use .
every investigation into false men@@ tions , however , should also be considered internationally as internationally .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photographs by Andy Simm@@ ons used under CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. und@@ af@@ iz@@ able ) stri@@ ves to offer language @-@ avi@@ ans a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate .
such words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these in@@ ex@@ changeable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every effort of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation , and sometimes a context is required to understand precisely what &apos;s meant by this word .
these unique words have been collected for a long time in an online list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , in the blog you will find words from the M@@ anu@@ at@@ u M@@ yl@@ at@@ u .
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Get your parents in recognition of how to keep yourself trying in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language which are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after being poured in cold days in the sun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they conf@@ ers other cultures , un@@ veil other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes you affect how we analyze and classi@@ fy the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site want even more of these &quot; un@@ removable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive are these little languages .
speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Languages &quot; who are very appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite words here .

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding of the decade
the archip@@ elago of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slide disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon mon@@ soon , who usually places the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , Gin , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 bor@@ ou@@ ghs in the south and west of the country over the shore .
after a statement of dis@@ astro@@ us escape from Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and mud winds .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since the last Friday ( May 26 ) and about 100 000 people were brought into 304 secure lo@@ unges .
the rain falls on Saturday ( 27th May ) , and the waterfalls in some areas were slowly back .
health and hygiene conditions constitute a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos provide an impression of the scale of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water stands of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ s and Sri Lanka are delivering regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly poison en@@ closures the den@@ im crisis , let Save the Children , after other rainf@@ alls are already on the way .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus rose up to 6 metres in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da in G@@ alle , flooded during the last night of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operation and five will be delivered to transport of emergen@@ cies for the residents included in their flooded villages .
various organizations and start@@ ups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od V@@ ICT@@ IMS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about flood situation and humanitarian aid .
if there are any search and rescue teams d@@ ron@@ es for their operations , please call the 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry foods and li@@ fel@@ ong goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this field .
the Tax@@ i@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app so that the cat@@ op@@ ho@@ e centre is informed .
last year after the disaster of the Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ me introduced a &quot; high water aid &quot; key which allowed it to call a car to pick up assistance services and donations . these were then directed to the sr@@ il@@ ank@@ ian Red Cross .
they launched a &quot; SOS &quot; button , which had more than thousand en@@ quiries and 150 successful bo@@ at@@ es@@ a@@ ign actions for flood and land@@ slides .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the united efforts by the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , with whom several social media platforms are fully exhausted , bring inhabitants in need of security and provide help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is coming to the recovery of norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
B . Dam@@ as in January I took part in Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and loving friend .
I trust her four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in one minute we call symbols for women &apos;s rights .
in the next sk@@ ating we are right for trans@@ gender .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the i@@ con@@ ical image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , other sn@@ apped par@@ oles vs. Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; my friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things are not about you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I already led this conversation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom I work or people who know me since years , separate myself - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is based in their conception . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they di@@ sen@@ Muslim me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion different .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , on different kind . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well @-@ designed in our collective performance that as soon as Muslims , who like I do not fit into the Muslim .
ab@@ normal@@ ities are being mi@@ zed
I am not alone with that alone .
this is even the poet &apos;s place , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images will one in the sense when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
as J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the western idea , religion was called Rum@@ is , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ etion makes a large extent of the history of 1,7 billion Muslims of this world .
another consists of the ab@@ duc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims , which has been colon@@ ized by Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing picture language is determined by the dark man you should fear , and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid divi@@ des the story behind these paintings in the 1970s .
but these paintings still rise further today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood still viol@@ ate them .
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen such powerful , fla@@ wed nar@@ rative and news feeds .
this nar@@ rative over@@ shadows the reality that led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the US won &apos;t even choose their first female presidential candidate .
this nar@@ rative fails to detect that when French , Muslim women are prevented , to wear their head@@ scarf in public buildings and forced to cover Saudi Arabia with their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
a powerful group makes his &quot; control &quot; based on the &quot; others . &quot;
this powerful nar@@ rative weak@@ ens Muslim women , to conduct the movements for change .
it sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken in the American soil of Afri@@ cans who were brought to slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this nar@@ rative has filled our collective action of such art deep and fla@@ wed , that often S@@ ik@@ h @-@ men and children become a target of anti@@ mon@@ astic attacks and ch@@ ic@@ an@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we tell and about the way we can tell , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not just afraid of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than tell stories that are based on facts .
or at alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rati@@ ves that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to detect the scar@@ city of 1,7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here where seven million Muslims turn the highest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the total Muslim population is afri@@ can @-@ shaped Americans .

four decades ago , my parents decided to live in New York to live her American dream .
my mother put her first jewelry design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ atics of Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then when Khan thought the world &apos;s Sky@@ lines from the world , my parents were ab@@ used Muslims and Americans .
but am I now w@@ asted Muslims and Americans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t say any pork , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes or bear my hand@@ bag , whom all Muslims contribute to themselves - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of respect from Pepp@@ a W@@ utz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I j@@ ze , we don &apos;t carry all bags with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or for almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who make an effort to combat far @-@ spread lies across Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated islam@@ ic machine machinery , think tanks and experts for wr@@ inkl@@ ing , which is our already faulty picture of what a Muslim is , or what Islam is , manip@@ ulated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the stories we tell and about the way we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is in more than just a stranger who under@@ mines the head@@ scarf . &quot; &quot; &quot;

I want to explain that .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim who was born when I was four years old when I was four years old in a provis@@ ional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social sciences describe religious life , they rely on the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , will see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , though I hold them in my arms , and you shall whis@@ k the Arab verses to protect the Kor@@ an and called the Q@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask therefore that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim &apos;s citizenship is always part of my shadow .

it is the picture of her that I &apos;ll see my eyes when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings ; and a Kor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters , which they can be quite co@@ stly .
Muslim means to be the prayers , which she said to me , when I have a bad day .
it is to be Muslims , as she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , What God means , my only Lord .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a people who founded - over the centuries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Empire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - which has founded a company with the name of Ven@@ erable British Ost@@ ini@@ dies @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep importance to call God my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot;

meanwhile , while he writes the books about the modern Islam and about the independence K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan van@@ ished to his family in India with K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he was not allowed to close into his arms in half a century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; membership is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palest@@ inians , whose families were torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at play risk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Muslims , to be aware that in the last two centuries Europeans have capit@@ alized to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was rejected by a Muslim country over a century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir sub@@ jection of British Empire , was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dangerous &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because he led the first mosque in England . &quot; &quot; &quot;

to my Muslim bro@@ ws of 1,7 billion , one goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ plugged history .
it means to remind that four@@ teen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops , apart from every continent apart from Antarc@@ tica , have gone to hunt mass destruction weapons , that did not exist .
it means to know that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the w@@ reck@@ age of the war .
being an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means to know that when a tragedy is seeking the USA and the susp@@ ects has found a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; white &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to know that four@@ teen years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slaves , named Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ l@@ aved and brought to this land .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X a American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people over@@ crowded the airports to fight against Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and if we are saying black lives .
to be an American woman , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , an Muslims and a journalist , to introduce the inher@@ ent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our multilingual ident@@ ities , but to fail to communicate it to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the nar@@ rative of 1,7 billion holds more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ er , but is represented in the reduced branch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mother means to ensure my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build on this branch of structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is in Muslim regist@@ ers who started with President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it consists in consistent monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immig@@ ration officials , who takes a child of five years old .
it consists of a country that includes its borders with people from just the countries who bom@@ bed it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly @-@ list &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that largely takes the Arabs and Muslims into the visor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the wars which we lead and the bombs , which we reject to Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell us , we are here .
in a study with the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of Nor@@ th@@ western University participants showed a scientific picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims have obtained the lowest score .
the conversation we have to guide
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep dar@@ ing to enth@@ using Muslim or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stand for decades to detect the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous image prints yiel@@ ded in our news editorial offices .
at least , there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to gras@@ p out our many multiple ident@@ ities and forgotten history .
the Podcast Sea Some@@ thing , Say Some@@ thing of Muslims ; the pod@@ casts # Good@@ Mus@@ Muslim Bad@@ Muslim , an initiative to print more Muslim writers and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , Muslim , American super@@ hel@@ din - all of this makes me hope .

but I am concerned with this difficult global time , where we are in .
and this moment has consequences arising out over the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason for con@@ spi@@ racy the@@ or@@ ists that existed in the dark corners of the Internet now , now the White House .
they are exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown because they made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that exp@@ orting exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by being &quot; others &quot; created .
but a few years earlier she had not yet been given ; now she is controlling large areas in Syria and Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am concerned about the real@@ ities and the story that I was not aware of what I was as old now my daughter , but who made me today to a w@@ reck@@ less Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
things I have left here like a bread@@ crum@@ bs in my speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; things that may provo@@ ke memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that our human race does , may l@@ ur@@ ge a story where someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
right now , at the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversation took place in the context of the 8th Annual Conference of Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; others &quot; , &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American mil@@ itar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are no terms in which we usually cast us in our schools or that we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where is Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and affected by the proc@@ ure of the &quot; others &quot; in the public vision four decades ago of science of Stan@@ ford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to lay un@@ comfortable questions after the role of this , consci@@ ously and deliber@@ ately committed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; as such as my girlfriend and I did not give us a new future in which we have no President , the chocolate cake , while he had already en@@ caps@@ ulated countries and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for nar@@ rati@@ ves wants to preserve urban language variety
stories , by Flickr @-@ users of Daniele Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to get in touch with someone else , despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , the founder of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the story of stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices recently reported about a different initiative by Steven Bird , the In@@ dispens@@ able Blog .
however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain and stran@@ gle the language variety of major cities .
in fact , in an urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin , Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land , where T@@ LS has already performed events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite as little languages were not given to the children born there .
for the makers of the project apply :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mass mortality of the world can be avoided if we manage to take cities - safe spaces in which inhabitants must not forget who they are to belong in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen often so often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to understand these events &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to feel , to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ eller tells their story in their own language and translate them in English .
even though the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their dev@@ otion and their representation will allow the list@@ eners to be inhal@@ ed .
they make up laughing and emotions as the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows such a traditional history from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller Ras@@ si@@ dat@@ ou compet@@ es also the opportunity to explain the customs of tales for their land .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the be@@ ak from the bun@@ ni@@ es and the P@@ avian in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after he explains the meaning of his parable , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that will not understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a wide smile he shares his feeling of inclusion : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
until now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling in three cities have taken place and the organiz@@ ers hope to expand this . all that are inspired by the project can get in touch with T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico calls for the United States New Year of Deb@@ t
with the aim of a New Test for the public debts of Puerto Rico , who took part in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 , several religious and bourgeois organisations participated in a mass rally ; the march of the capital , which went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón , in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was proclaimed by the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ ía de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( for the ne@@ ural examination of the debts ) and the Eastern Church Assembly of Puerto Rico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the advoc@@ ates of the restructuring of the debt also submitted a pet@@ ition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico claimed that politicians , ben@@ ker and government agencies that are responsible for their debts to their corruption .
we call for financial examination and an Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debts , with a firm , our working conditions appropriate re@@ mun@@ eration that is in favor of the economy .
we will be pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not pay attention to decreasing retirement payments .

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missed over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives arrested the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open network .
this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , annual conference on the digital culture annual meeting held in Berlin , devoted to the event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of the Book Prize of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ d ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective dependence ) .
the book , which was published last year , has been released and posted here , includes a number of essays that deal with free culture in face of supp@@ ression .
it is an homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is called :
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built , and what the true costs are linked to whom this is connected .
activists , artist , designer , developers , researcher and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have been working on page to get over the fog that surro@@ unds our news@@ feeds and to create something out of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free the Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , who has been detained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was rep@@ ain@@ ted from the directory of the Ad@@ ra prison in which he sat on October 3 , 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for its participation in a free culture , many of us start thinking about their own destiny , actions and decisions .
why Are We Here ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up extreme beliefs in this process ?
since March 2012 , the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody by Syrian government authorities .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the Ad@@ ra prison , a non @-@ military facility to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ sel had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in Ad@@ ra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who had informed himself as an in@@ sider of the Assad administration and informed them about a alleged death sentence against her husband .
his residence and condition remains unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a decisive role to extend the Internet and to knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologi@@ an , and currently over@@ lap the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project called Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps no one of Bas@@ sels cultural prototypes was acting as the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important arch@@ eological sites in the world , was the cross of many civi@@ liz@@ ations and here are Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ sel wasn &apos;t able to know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would set everything that em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this move into digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a time cartridge , which will be the public for public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel could not complete this project yet .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my entire life with it , dre@@ aming of freedom , and bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
he taught me English , even when he was in custody .
I learned to read , write and speak English .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked him . he has taught others to read , write and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened my door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners , as they use computers , at least theoretical , without having actually held one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a trial application that she was in prison from 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura have worked together in the book for one year .
she cast the lyrics with him , when she visited him , and he translated them from the Arabic into English .
the book is freely available .
book covers of Yous@@ sef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens with every visit ,
that I fail in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes ,
that I lose the reflection on the moment in which we embrace ourselves ,
that any danger does not matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , fet@@ ters and guard
I forget the pris@@ ings of the prison
and I penet@@ rate every detail of your voice and words ;
whom I carry with passion ,
when your eyes say farewell
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly turn back to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring all the moments ,
and over your absence to cry and to smile .
I test@@ ify to myself that I will return soon ...

according to the Syrian network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , since the beginning of protests against the Syrian network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared .
those who were arrested or were swallowed by the regime were tor@@ tured or executed .
by 2016 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in prison according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the stories of many other people are unknown .

today , we repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambique : Director of corruption in case of corruption re@@ inst@@ ated on previous post
Mos@@ ambique responded to anger on a corruption incident in which a government member returned to the work in the state machine after half of his sentence after half of his sentence .
this is a de@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , which was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ endants ( about 800 000 € ) to 22 years imprisonment .
the money came from the public funds of the airports of Mozambique whose Council appointed Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for a good lead and immediately ordered his res@@ ult@@ ation to the company , which was then on April 19 .
in accordance with a general opinion of the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , there would be no haz@@ ard background for Cam@@ b@@ aza , to again refer to his old item , as the company had no discipline after his detention .
however , many citizens do not need this action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Inte@@ gri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution which advoc@@ ates itself for public transparency , in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the decision of the company to stop the director again : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; poses a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the absence of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression regarding the efforts of our legal system , thus the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we have to inform about that also the company should have instit@@ uted a disciplinary approach against the contra@@ dic@@ ting workers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the firm , however , seems to ensure reasonable legal measures for the application of appropriate functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behaviour also and considered the case as &quot; contra@@ dic@@ tory &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to one prison term and half of them had to eat .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speech , he could advise and re@@ pose his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has decided to become integrated into the company , which he helped to cause harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza would love to be paid for his silence .
resist@@ ible !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says , the director does not have any moral authority :
Cam@@ b@@ aza by the State re@@ wards , because he bel@@ lied to it , I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded someone in such a way that has already mas@@ sively ins@@ ulted the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza l@@ acks mor@@ als to serve and serve the State , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has only served by the State instead .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as he had been getting tired of an in@@ exhau@@ st@@ ible money source and the state itself is we@@ ary that was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally condemned to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this guy was rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the prime minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief belongs to the prison :
th@@ ie@@ ves belong to the prison Zam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only remain in memory for ever as an independent president but also as a sharp , one cutting and - by the way - prophe@@ tic speakers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of his most famous illustrations was when he affir@@ med that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man was capable of all his own individual interest to sell his own individual interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then Sam@@ ora said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person is changing , my experience shows that it is not so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he changes the tac@@ tics , but he does not address his amb@@ itions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an ambitious human being is a criminal one . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also rejected :
sentenced to 22 years in prison , Cam@@ b@@ aza was in prison for 10 years and was released .
and today , the company puts it in which he gives funds of the un@@ faithful , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - of par@@ son@@ ic writing . ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12 , 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and has cen@@ sored many users in@@ justice
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar p@@ e &quot; means chick@@ pe@@ as or spi@@ der .

according to information from Facebook users in Myanmar , the popular social network accepted its postal mail from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is normally used to refer to people East Indian source or generally used as an ad@@ jective . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook comp@@ iles the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in bur@@ mes@@ ic writing ) as part of an initiative in order to address the popular problem of speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely high @-@ value con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that most often used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in his efforts to fight rab@@ bits in Myanmar , the company has compens@@ ated a lot of meaningful content on his platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar can normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not automatically call acceptance speech .
the context is important , # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even post@@ ings in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doub@@ ts about his use for use , cen@@ sored .
moreover , there are several bur@@ ial words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , stool is written on Bur@@ m@@ ically &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Spider ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ k@@ aar &apos; ( Cur@@ tain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ gn@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
one post of my friends was er@@ ased today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends in a spiritual way if they were w@@ anting as he could alle@@ vi@@ ate his sp@@ inal pain by making a p@@ un .
the set ku la - &quot; cure &quot; ( ku ) + the Quest@@ ionnaire ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that it will be reduced by radical nation@@ alists , but it also stressed that Facebook to be analy@@ tic to spread all Post@@ s that are suspected to spread rac@@ ism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it automatically filters the word automatically .
the automation will not understand what you are writing on Fac@@ be@@ ire .
what it should do instead is carefully read the post and check it by checking the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar p@@ e &quot; ( switch balls ) .
the good thing is that these tri@@ angular nation@@ alists , who spread h@@ ass@@ language , get a rather good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise its nation@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the action may send a strong signal to all of them , the efficiency of this strategy is no longer att@@ ain@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proved that the c@@ ens@@ orship will often start to use a cat and mouse game , whereby the users can simply start social networks to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the scanned word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his post as he wanted to share his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished by the social network :
... when I was aware of this new policy from Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my post from Facebook was removed and told me that the li@@ ken , post and parts of content was prohibited for 24 hours because the post &quot; on the Facebook community standards did not decide . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of postcards from people who don &apos;t have negative inten@@ tions or trying to show their opinions about the ass@@ essing radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate language :
postal mail is removed from Facebook .
in the mail the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are po@@ or@@ ly .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have been doing more at the beginning of the initiative , for example asking the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask advice :
Facebook has a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by their platform , but it doesn &apos;t work like that .
such words can only be used more hat@@ red within the various communities .
in addition , it seems as if it all started without local context or technical support and forbidden as words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ as cur@@ ry &quot; .
even when they found that they made mistakes , they did not try to pur@@ ify the fal@@ si@@ fied Post@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would have a great turnover , that would be great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ orship has taken care of a lot under the users .
rather than take it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consci@@ ously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of h@@ ass@@ language to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots from Facebook post@@ ings which were not clu@@ ded but nevertheless removed :

the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and look at pe@@ dic@@ cur@@ ry and watch a Indian film .

over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , social networks have used to enhance their voices and influence .
among other things , H@@ ass@@ au is to continue to heat the violence in Myanmar in Myanmar , especially in the area Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have been forced to escape .
Facebook has been critic@@ ized for his failure to critic@@ ise the balancing h@@ ass@@ le on its Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control .
but instead of just putting the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better to have looked at the context as on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .

the age of children in Trinidad and Tobago now illeg@@ ally .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament unanim@@ ously approved a law which forbi@@ ds this practice , so that the pan@@ try age is now at 18 .
before that change of the sp@@ ouse , some members had dev@@ out Hindu and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ ad Mahar@@ aj had come to a group that was deleg@@ ate to the various religious groups of the country so that the state should not inter@@ fere , as this is , age do not pun@@ ish the maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happened un@@ certain that Trinidad and Tobago has an contractual partner of the UN &apos;s legal Convention , the min@@ ors considered to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every person under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics from the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who had already been married to 15 percent in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 they were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 the country &apos;s Statist@@ ical Office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media mot@@ ions , which were ende@@ av@@ oured to abol@@ ish laws on pedi@@ atri@@ ots , followed by great support . without doubt , they helped to bring this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hindu guide , for example , had no concerns that they should say the criticism &apos; criticism , they should be dam@@ ned to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition headed for ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and sometime , doub@@ ts came about whether the opposition of the law would agree .
but the bill was decided at the beginning of 2017 - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent that contained in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the president of the country must appro@@ ve and declare the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update to Facebook , which was posted to the Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill bill against the children &apos;s area was decided in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes , and none of them was decided .
once he has been decided in the Senate , the draft may now become a stat@@ ute .
the majority of social media @-@ users were thrilled , because the laws of the children &apos;s area were finally changed .
Lov@@ ell Francis , a host office of the Ministry of Education , said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has taken a lot of time and unnecessary talk that is ve@@ iled to the core of the cause , but you know what ? the children in Trinidad and Tobago now are illegal and this is worth every prize . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while Abel Jackson was the opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had come finally :
public Status Quo release on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excell@@ ent news !
the sp@@ ouse has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , - 35 - against that ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that was quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was noted :
the marriage age of Trinidad and Tobago has now become independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the amend@@ ment to the amend@@ ment of the Act was approved today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 members of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all de@@ pu@@ ties , who were against , voted for the law .
the child &apos;s area in Trinidad and Tobago don &apos;t allow us any more .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ r@@ illi@@ pu@@ ree .
many thanks to all the activists who con@@ sent@@ ed him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our M@@ EPs .
but a possible hook is found in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , according to the secretary general of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hindu @-@ organization in the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj had announced his intention to undertake the judi@@ cial steps , should the law be approved , and he seems to fully redeem his promise .
while the General At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a supp@@ orter of the law , said it is quite right if Mahar@@ aj wishes against the law , would like most social media users , you would argue the debate on this subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed :
dear Sat , if we don &apos;t say instead of speaking , in a way that could cause only panic and evil , instead of speaking to the problem , that the state , our daughters , that they might be compared to them , would be mis@@ used , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think it &apos;s not about a problem ?
but whether it comes to a judi@@ cial approach to the law , or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children in different gra@@ d@@ ations are legal or still the norm , though there are laws that they say .

through the mirrors of websites , Turkish users can look back on Wikipedia content
the English version of Wikipedia left on 18 January 2012 , opposed to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally obsc@@ ured .
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than one month , Turkey closed the popular and on the crowd sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
tag on day is more clearly , how important the user is for users to find helpful and reliable information .
both students as well as repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking .
although many techniques used to use blocked web users ( a new article from the New York Times suggests that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users don &apos;t fall into this category .
although Turkey has been closed from Wikipedia as recently as recently as a report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Small Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society on Harvard University has been submitted to find regular block@@ ings on the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most known country in the world , when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform is still locked , several mirrors are displayed ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform has removed all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its dec@@ entr@@ alised Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer network which is not supported on the system of domain names and makes a complete c@@ ens@@ orship difficult .
the content is not call@@ able despite legal ban .
in a blo@@ g@@ post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) we sat on it all about reading snapshots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the content in a centr@@ alized , distributed way .
this can help users to view all the Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.org .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was performed independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it only concerns screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the lock .
Crist@@ ian Cons@@ onn@@ i from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has a mirror site of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open @-@ source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors respect if it is blocked in the country of Wikipedia .
Cons@@ onn@@ i reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member and collabor@@ ator at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; pod@@ cast :
it is no complete copy of a proxy address , a Mir@@ ror .
one access@@ es another URL that is not the original , that what you see is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server will forward the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey .

I live on the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate game photograph@@ ers ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father , that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the River dam is just a few minutes from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the space on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately started to cra@@ ck pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar att@@ aches a collaboration with the authorities to acquire global recognition for Nep@@ als Nature and wants to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not so terri@@ fying as they look .
and he should know it , for he was already on face to face to face :
a tiger can &apos;t be dis@@ rup@@ ted from the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
I too was at home because of the dark on the way home when suddenly the king of Bu@@ he@@ ks appeared . he immediately begins to see us and he star@@ es through the Sal trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent in order to take pictures from Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live near the tourist attractions .
see below some of these photos .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India .
a revised version was re@@ published here as part of a share @-@ sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , there are women with great care , the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a t@@ onom@@ ic or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h , women may respect that they respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , and fear of the consequences they ought to respect the norm .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convicted of an Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a p@@ seu@@ do@@ court and viol@@ ate their family and the village community after she had spoken a native relatives with his name .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also not by name , is also common among men . however , they have far fewer allow@@ ances to fear , if any one , they should not come after this practice .
in the small village Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them Health don@@ tics and house@@ wives , a unique club and were thus quickly became the main topic of the city .
it is a place just for them alone where they discuss and discuss the host@@ ility of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as one of 56 clubs that exists in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is run by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is engaged in the exploitation of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was working for seven years with the help of her video camera in the field of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and guides these clubs .
it reports , as these clubs have created a safe place for these women and they simultaneously made them to amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of change .
the first video showing the Roh@@ ini in its discussion round , was the best selling of women who did not call their hus@@ bands on behalf .
she decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women could easily identify .
the names of their hus@@ bands did not speak lou@@ dly , a custom , to maintain and never be question@@ ed .
the Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition shows that a woman is respected by her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not keep this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ty , as woman without mor@@ ality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never had thoughts about this discussion round about this discussion .
at the beginning Roh@@ ini , who had never had called her husband , had never wanted to try his name at home , as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round of her husband and mother in law .
Roh@@ ini talks about :
my mother in law and my husband still weigh long after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I should call him from now on his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage Roh@@ ini began their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to put the discussion with practice .
Roh@@ ini asked any participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked them all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , that they cannot respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on her lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Roh@@ ini Pa@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women never married the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini talks about :
a woman was so shy , that she could only be afraid during the whole practice ; one another decided to release the whole gest@@ ion of frustr@@ ation against him and his family , causing it to curse him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
even in the ad@@ ren@@ aline , to have broken with an old custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands upon name .
and they held their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in his head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother in law came her , she was afraid , and told that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini meant I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a group of participants was less under@@ stand@@ able and the situation part@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reported how women tried to stop other practices , such as carrying the galvan@@ ic score on the forehead , showing the sp@@ ouse :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ ced red point if he did .
he laughed at only , and I stopped doing that to bear him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other women have not completely stopped with it , but they , they are now in a better position to choose him , not to bear him on some days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we are doing an excursion at each discussion club .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I do not want women to worry about who could hear what &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months she celebrated her own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time ; they d@@ anced and talking about things about which they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have been doing about some things , for example how our ident@@ ities are knot@@ ted to our hus@@ bands , never as hon@@ est@@ ly spoken .
it feels great to say things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honour and how it is associated with clothes .
some women in the group had only taken sar@@ is in their marriage .
for most of them that is okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ ad @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide tro@@ d over a pants , wear ; they have not dar@@ ed .
after a lot of argument and discussion on the advantages of their own clos@@ ets , mor@@ als linked to the Sar@@ is and much more , g@@ lass@@ works Roh@@ ini their own couple of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round , so that women could wear it .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a in which they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they will succeed .
on the question , whether in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini affir@@ med that things come into rolls slowly :
so far we have made only little steps .
some women tast@@ ed it a few times , but then listened to the name of her husband .
some people are confin@@ ed to make it , but only when they are alone and not other family members .
only one or two say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women are now wearing Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red at their fore@@ heads .
the women in a discussion lu@@ b know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the fever on more freedom of movement or their own clos@@ ets - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how to explain Roh@@ ini :
each one of us is victims of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
but with this club , each of us gives confidence that something is going to change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if every woman is home in the club and other people about it , what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the Beatles of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is regarded as the revers@@ al in Japanese culture of post @-@ war years .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who had exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beatles 1964 in London , noted on the 50th anniversary of the first visit :
for just about five days the Beatles were in the land , but this was enough to let the Japanese turn through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people here soon became clear that they had no other choice than receiving the Beatles with open arms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their Zen@@ it when the Beatles had arrived in Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the individual trade show Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ kei Asian Review . &quot; &quot; &quot;

I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; should be John Lenn@@ on or not .
and as it belongs for fans , Japanese also made pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the familiar places that are linked to the band .
if you love the Beatles , you are your 5 places you have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Ma@@ the@@ w Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( Memorial in New York )

a new system of kidn@@ apping persons for organic purposes , probably for super@@ st@@ itious purposes , wor@@ ries the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a number of operations to life in order to stop the Pra@@ k@@ tics .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found be@@ headed , and a part of the organs were found .
two men were arrested , and in the epis@@ de they were sitting that the bodies of sh@@ am@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
there is the local super@@ st@@ ition that the head of a gl@@ itter@@ ing man of gold contained gold contained or riches , the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , the BBC .
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks were registered on a man of man in Mozambique .
another group , which is aimed at murder , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN mission carried out a mission in the South African country to investig@@ ate this practice of practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ st@@ ition and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who have prepared to travel to the country :
attention to lam@@ ah@@ le men who are traveling to Mozambique are the aim of ritual attacks , warned the Muslim police according to the latest assass@@ ination of three glorious men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ k , where these mur@@ ders were arrested .
Hus@@ ky Alg@@ y Ad@@ amo , student and residents of the city of In@@ rock in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police already said :
PR@@ M believes that the sh@@ am@@ ans are involved in the death of young men .
the persecution and killing of smooth individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ las@@ bal@@ a , for probably super@@ st@@ itious ritu@@ als , has given cultural motives and is given by the traditional sh@@ am@@ ans , which also indicates a belief that the victims might have power , according to which the victims in their head might have power .
in the last days three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha reported on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the trigger arms sn@@ ai@@ ppa , which indicated that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty of which Mozambique is facing :
I would like to go to GER@@ MAN E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ k , TH@@ AT S@@ AM , to go to the streets of a por@@ no@@ graphic in which the teachers would not fight against good notes , and if they were able to hunt for their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor ch@@ at@@ as for super@@ st@@ itious purpose or &quot; black magic , &quot; which aim to gain rapid wealth .
despite the sin@@ cer@@ ity of phenomena , some of the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ hor@@ ror could not escape .

free Bas@@ sel : Ne@@ ti@@ zen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) Neu@@ n reactions to the medical treatment of Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and dis@@ sident Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia , that was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partner agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dis@@ si@@ dents of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o had raised attention in the international community after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the end stage .
in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison because of &quot; Subversion &quot; ( the state of state after the Dra@@ ft ) , a manifest@@ o which calls for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a speaker told , he committed it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not required to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet China continue to maintain calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Liu X@@ ia , release or give him treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , other topics are completely explo@@ ited .
Hong Kong Free Press has consolidated some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu .
a speaker , however , refused to comment whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to treat Liu abroad a treat .
Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister in Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Bren@@ de refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway was taken into stores after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010 , although the Norwegian government told that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
the diplomatic relations continued only in December last year , Norway signed an agreement to escal@@ ate the salmon after China , because the exports had been blocked since 2010 .
after the message has been spreading that Liu was seriously ill and brought the Nobel Peace to express his hope for an un@@ conditional release and invited Liu to pick his price in Oslo .
because of his arrest , he was not able to accept his price .
during the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on July 6 , the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to free Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to request medical support where he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini also asked China to release the release of Li@@ us as described in a statement on 30 June :
we expect China to raise all the limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all visits , who they wish and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told that Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he has the possibility for the treatment abroad , in@@ sof@@ ar it was given to him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an spokes@@ woman in the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the message agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the Embassy to release Chinese authorities but not only to free Liu , but also his wife Ms. Liu X@@ ia from their house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the translation of the US Embassy returned to China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country have the right to re@@ locate himself to Chinese internal affairs and ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with China to offer the couple below :
protection and freedom , such as trav@@ ellers and access to medical care of their choice , which they have made according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also adopted a decision in Congress to impos@@ e the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I ask China to release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally , so that he can proceed in proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert on July 3 , Berlin I hope that Liu was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support he needed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he should be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping was published on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters , that China had great concerns about the vor@@ tex by Liu could be transp@@ osed into Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide an adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to re@@ locate himself from his family .
Li@@ us Adv@@ oc@@ ate told AF@@ P previously , that Li@@ us woman , Liu X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but police always monitored the room in the hospital , and that it is not permitted to contact anyone outside , including his lawyers , contact and contact them .
Mc@@ Call@@ um is talking about :
Canada calls on China to safegu@@ ard his international human rights obligations , including free speech and freedom for the exercise of these rights .
France
France &apos;s Foreign Office called for China in a declaration on 29 June to release Liu from humanitarian motives :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments that he needs , regardless where needed . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information if France will eventually receive him .
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the events in Taiwan called for China on June 27th to show Liu and demand a greater tolerance towards those who require peaceful means to promote political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Israeli progress party also urged China to allow the sick of intellectual Liu to treat yourself in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself in a statement on 28 June by Liu were very worried and gave that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Liu :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my belief that he took and had kept strictly punished to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China to have contributed to a peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt very moved and also encouraged , as I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who were under charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem dum@@ b , as it is recognized at an international level as an independent state .
but , according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore should be considered a city .
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting occasion of the meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association , the Minister found that many people critic@@ ised the dom@@ ination of the only political party in Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
it supports that Singapore should be considered a city .
... nobody asked whether New York be a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , with most people going a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a town .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog of Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to turn logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exerc@@ ices of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and offered sacrifices to create this valuable land , we hear that ultimately we are not a country .
it so@@ unded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight before the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose country is it ?
the reasons performed by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in the face of that , he appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally by a party .
these towns are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject , the good old surro@@ unds of the author@@ itarian makers appears to be the pre@@ dominant logic , since it fits better to their power .
at the end of the final week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am we were given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our advertis@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ responses .
associated questions he acted with non @-@ responses r@@ ational type .
Rachel Z@@ eng ur@@ ges Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am to illustr@@ ate his mind since she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I think it &apos;s a bit hard to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country but a city , in which country belongs to our city ...
short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our value K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take on the trouble to clari@@ fy this point as he was paid very much to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by rele@@ asing his comment on the blog , he points out regarding the critics that you should begin to understand the complete tran@@ script of the conference so to understand the context of the say@@ ings of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am better , according to which Singapore was a city and no country .
read the address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ even if we delight in free and just choices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the U.S. ( and how many of these towns looked for a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment via Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , the leader of a growing generation that makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore told , very ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w and the members of the old Gar@@ de which I expected - be with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I doub@@ ts and I &apos;m not sure if he really believe that he really believes and is aware of what he defended .
the TEM@@ AS@@ EK Review conclu@@ des the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams Arg@@ uments :
does Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; committed a mistake &quot; or was it a w@@ ud@@ der spokes@@ man ?
when Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as independent and so@@ vereign State ?
if not , on which country go the so@@ vereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally both land and city .
as he plays an important role within the government &apos;s cabinet , the say@@ ings of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am are of grave significance .
why do the Singap@@ ore@@ ans do their military service , do they defend only their city but not their country ?
who must pay our Prime Minister &apos;s bills ?
what is the value of our pink people ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
if the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade ten@@ ds to the affir@@ mation of Singapore and it was always a town :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence shines many Singap@@ ore@@ ans to have anno@@ yed ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc , but that &apos;s not quite right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screenshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most ab@@ used aspect in your home or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors exposed to certain parts of the world and to be shown another fac@@ et .
the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thompson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , which lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is put to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , there is a polit@@ ician to show interest in his conversation partner by presenting personal questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on my clari@@ fication , the standard answer usually follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ hockey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans cook nau@@ gh@@ ty especially anger , if they are held for Americans , but doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who does not know itself , there is little that Can@@ adi@@ ans differs from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans put a Canadian banner good to their backpack if they travel .
everyone loves Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans are , however , ... .
as early as I began 20 years ago , Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before the 11th September , began to travel through the world .
Canadian had always carried little map@@ le sheets on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
the same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think , Canada is so great .
we are courteous .
we obviously say very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada also counts as the most toler@@ ant country opposite ethnic groups .
we are not as those types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate it .
first , I have many American friends I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t be for me , if I would change to Johnny from Dallas by example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , to be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is basically to be sh@@ ed@@ gy - as such as the ben@@ evol@@ ent , soft , but trag@@ ically un@@ significant character N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( which has its own Canadian bi@@ ker ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Canada would really have a nation of people like N@@ ed Flanders , indeed , it would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kind &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no edges and edges , nothing in which one can encounter .
harmless to be , is un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting to earn no attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from things that happen around one around .
I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone , a prime minister of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what exterior appears as &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just chil@@ ly courtesy .
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t talk about the fence with the neigh@@ bors .
we lack warm heart@@ y , open friendliness , which I connect with my American friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thank@@ fully for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Just@@ in Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Canadian is more than just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a music video published in Thailand is a music video which took the Jun@@ ta and re @-@ gover@@ n the power of 2014 and re @-@ gover@@ n the civilian government despite their promises to re@@ produce the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ zel Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who told it which rules it makes his girlfriend .
although not expressly political , the music video rel@@ ates in@@ directly to the ongoing military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for song was a huge success .
in the first three days alone , the video was allocated to Facebook at 1,@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 likes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists needs to watch the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and enter@@ taining introduction to Thai politics , in particular as it is acting under the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at those recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political issues linked to Thailand during the last three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ stic section 44 of the preliminary constitution given to the commander of the army , absolute national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are viewed by the Jun@@ ta as a critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose vag@@ ue and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to assume activists and other critics of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose a new unit in the army has also been instit@@ uted , super@@ vised by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Online Content &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and persec@@ uted people who have been accused of having persec@@ uted the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thailand uses a strict ban against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ esty of Maj@@ esty ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup .
one of the problems which the Jun@@ ta continues to buy , is their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warning them , the purchase is un@@ necessary and a waste of tax money .
the video even shows how people will be thrown into a black van , before moving into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem incident occurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists sit in prison because they have repor@@ tedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened for long prison stra@@ ins to ins@@ ist the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs from the band called the tribute from &quot; The tribute of Pan@@ em , &quot; was already used by the coup during protests in 2014 .
life goes on in the ruins of the ghost cities in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and is published here with kind permission .
the post@@ war company only re@@ covers very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now passed over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Prussian War has officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ se@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the basin of carbon @-@ Asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , am@@ as@@ ies , Georgia and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today most of the Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases live in the area .
such sett@@ lements are also called ghost cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people still lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic for spher@@ ical .
since 2011 , the total population of the 16@@ ,000 district , after a decade had barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all this is a result of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ story living blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , the Chr@@ u@@ ush@@ t@@ kov@@ y@@ kas are symbo@@ lically representing the decline and destruction of the region .
the buildings are falling and quite rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ aw@@ k@@ ha I met a local old man .
he starts a conversation and it is hard to stop this .
&quot; all this is a result of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why speak ?
it is still unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , who served all the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ ooth@@ ed si@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have now abandoned the district .
in the spirit city of D@@ z@@ han@@ se@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
some 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ ek , which is still one or two families , can be found on the balconies , where the laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look from the window of a destroyed home .
when they discover myself with the camera in your hand , they immediately go back .
&quot; our mother forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is just forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pered something to her friend and suddenly aband@@ on the destroyed buildings and disappeared .
many people work in the area for a small Turkish mining company named T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the consistency management ( growing domestic products for personal use ) such as livestock , bee@@ keeping and vegetable farming .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the laps .
the district administration supplies candles and bread in the winter for free .

&quot; I do not know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ cchini &quot;
about ten years ago , an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ j@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina does not have to leave Gal@@ ina in order to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will always remain in Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to accept financial help from her daughter and har@@ p that she supports her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly R@@ ente are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is hard to survive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; gives them . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old wife and a young family and I live in this building .
if you are a holiday , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this at all - everyone has his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ ante G@@ ye calls her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ cchini . &quot;
&quot; one can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a talk partner Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in their home for a few days .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds of the village fle@@ ct before the war .
despite its relatives who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ell broke out simply ) , they did not leave the opportunity to leave .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but that will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives approximately $ 9 children for every child .
her husband is working in the cab@@ bage pit .
the young family has its own farm .
close to the house where Nat@@ ascha kinder@@ garten was once located , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chick@@ ens .

but over time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that this building was destroyed during the war .
in fact , however , it is rather something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there were hardly any work and everyone lived like it was right .
I remember every day as the city and the war once were . &quot;

it runs through the windows of a destroyed building and hi@@ des .
a ball flying from the window and another boy ch@@ ases him back .
he plays with the ball , who rolls up the hill .
a group of children now sh@@ out the ball .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; hosts migrants &quot; migrants during their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez is a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , province of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and is published here with kind permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the way to migrants that cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I visited one of these places at the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city centre .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a cor@@ all@@ ine pink bread and gold earrings in te@@ ddy bear .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on the transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for approximately $ 50 per night the night sleep in simple rooms , with br@@ ushing , br@@ ushing walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for hotel - yet hundreds of African and Ha@@ iti@@ an migrants are coming here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells the people coming into full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at present , it is rather quiet but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on boxes .
she would not like to reject anybody .
she helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they bu@@ ys them medicines that they cannot pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m that exhausted from the long voyage .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebast@@ i@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived in a short time ago .
I asked him if M@@ um is a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebast@@ i@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a jo@@ v @-@ beard ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebast@@ i@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and her three children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some African , which are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and move towards north . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family owned by other companion of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Mich@@ elet , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells that the Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans already speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ App by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his pione@@ ers , Mich@@ elet had previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker for building sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was we@@ aken , he began his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to get the bu@@ zz@@ ic@@ ket after Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we will never go back again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always keep in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that their guests send their often text messages when they have gone to greet them or to report about the course of their journey .
she explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their job .
she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have contributed their chick@@ ens like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only spar@@ ks to travel to migrants that travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valencia and his family have mig@@ rated to immigrants in their little house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bu@@ li@@ ets are too expensive for many African immigrants .
he has begun to help them to obtain reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on floors on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking facility out .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I have been living in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled after a raid on his work place from the United States .
the majority of migrants that travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio C@@ ord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to black@@ mail him , without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown , a single @-@ one , offered him its roof .
a few months later the family still lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back to the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses , travelers consult their teleph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that their house is full , but it is also nost@@ al@@ gic because of them which went away .
like a proud grand@@ mother they sc@@ ared her in her album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair spots which you made a rally , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sad , while she presents her for a short time .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang people are forced to install a monitoring app on their phone .
a check @-@ in for personal communication units in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users for the base of the plan .
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the West China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi obtained a cell phone notification in which it displays the Government Government to install a monit@@ ory app named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should hin@@ der access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but , the authorities also inc@@ lined the app for more than the com@@ b@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Aut@@ onom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture because they had installed the app after they had been installed with a private We@@ Chat group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the press release , the app read and follow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and the distribution channels of terror@@ ists , along with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs@@ &apos;s website descri@@ bing the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online sc@@ am , tro@@ users and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they go online and to remot@@ ely control their home network of home networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remote &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers might be able to manip@@ ulate or steal the home network of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while not@@ if@@ ications with digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mainly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often glo@@ ster@@ ed for those who live in remote , pressed ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit dis@@ comfort and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , authorities often arrange extreme c@@ ens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ely Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Twitter @-@ based media out@@ let &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Images from Open China &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the cen@@ sored news in China released , showed photos from a Check@@ point , on which police officers were randomly checked if they had installed the monitoring app . &quot; &quot; &quot;
authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang @-@ App .
a mobile notification required that people will install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered in a Check@@ point with a device without these software , it could be in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
you have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by superior technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from Open China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Transfer from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also released a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system , and thus obtain unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard disk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and cell@@ phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic sciss@@ ors .
prescri@@ ptions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to minim@@ ize the city &apos;s instructions , the spread of illegal content .

a recent report by Freedom House , a US @-@ American Human Rights organisation , also referred to this new monitoring system :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a decree with the directive to all the residents and entrepren@@ eurs , to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; by local police .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intention is to identify and destroy any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrorist videos &quot; &quot; &quot; . however , this promotion has breach the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives guidance for a whole range of other possible verses , among them that relate to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sleep or death , Part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane is sign@@ posted in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you look at and place that you are entirely alone in a place where everything is important .
everything was dissolved after and after dissolved and a truth reveals that clearly recognis@@ able , both inside and outside .
one who makes their name all glory .
one that has struck down in a list of feelings and expres@@ sions , let not allow any met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when looking back the scenes and look behind the scenes - beyond the theater , the beautiful scenes and the per@@ formers - turn the characters in flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doub@@ ts dissolve in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence even though the Earth is stuck on the axis of the Un@@ he@@ ils . you are clear that you have been caught here between the walls that have set your parents , stone around stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that didn &apos;t allow me to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the chief of the security guard he formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he presented his power over us by destro@@ ying even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were torn apart from a peaceful protest like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was sufficient to divide the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ez@@ Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ aming .
all the districts sought cov@@ eted , but not my own .
for the first time , it was quiet , ar@@ ous@@ ed , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that is until in the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their compli@@ ments .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down , after the power supply stopped in the quarter stopped functioning .
I broke through the silence , crying out several times &quot; All@@ ow@@ all@@ i &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice by the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to assemble .
I was not alone .
many friends , real friends joined me ; we lied to a splendid picture that my expectations were full and full .
in such a moment you are aware that you delivered the ghost out of the lamp , but just don &apos;t care in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my Father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet us at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice after you have made it all the way to the office of security out of the body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I joined there .
the Colonel Gh@@ assan stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I do now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ assan begins to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t let me hear how you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you &apos;re only brave enough to scre@@ am , if we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes set up for me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you know what to look at me in my eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did , has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing before this building .
perhaps it was about my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps the revolution .
I was so sure when I said , &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never listened to seeing you in my eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary and his Father with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just like his father with it . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed is to me in the nose today .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a torture torture that I was exposed to months .
I scre@@ ams the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
afterwards through the courtyard and into the second office which leads through a gang to the individual cells .
I shape all the details exactly before I cared for the room .
otherwise , they felt a larger cell that was assigned to me .
I have to share it with only one single prisoner and let me sit at once , without waiting for her permission .
after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the civil servant left the cell , and I gra@@ b@@ bed on an old @-@ established communication method : to beat her f@@ ist against the wall .
I learned that my com@@ rade was a &quot; Er@@ sth@@ zen . &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a respected man of middle age that looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , there can be no striking facial features , and doctors are not there ; we are all only Num@@ bers .
&quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot;
all the answers connected his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would save him when I stay .
li@@ ars .
I would have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these cro@@ ws , which drain the fruit in the garden of my head lab@@ s .
from the distance I still hear &quot; All@@ ow@@ all@@ ahu &quot; scre@@ aming .
it must be around 10 noon in the evening . always in order to kill this time the cri@@ es , every day .
the door opens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was always convinced that black as the colour of per@@ dition , until I presented the yellow light , which put us the tone in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; interview on 13th S@@ ure of Kor@@ an ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you are here to be heard . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the secret was to protect and to prevent the state safety before us , to unite the tra@@ itor and terror@@ ists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ e dial@@ ect - and they played their conc@@ essions to their world view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a house that is here is no country ; it is a curse that it states co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their cl@@ an into a hero . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I take care of the hearing and meet Abu I@@ mad , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he always comes to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the facial expres@@ sions , which dec@@ ei@@ ves him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can join this day to protest against you and to protest against demonstrations , which will soon find an end anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I have used it to me , not to answer .
I can really tell you exactly when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become a friendly conversation for me to become an ordinary communication tool .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me told that I had to get used to get used to it , though I had done nothing to earn this punishment .
of punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to plu@@ ck me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls it lov@@ ingly &quot; conf@@ ession &quot; .
it starts with a plastic tube , which probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ ker re@@ treats your scre@@ ams .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cri@@ es .
my cri@@ es did not play enough for him , so that the pipe caused the pipe through a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collector , or whether it belonged to normal working equipment .
they had flown four cables to present us up , from their point of view , to present great invention of a giant cab@@ al .
within one hour three of them changed , while I was still in the row .
I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I listened to scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and found no appeal to it , which is why it took a neighbour to an electrically loaded rod .
electricity f@@ lowed through my entire body , enough to supply my entire district .
my semi @-@ cra@@ cker body , which lay stretched on the ground , was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness van@@ ished and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to lay down again , let us say that was my only option .
a few hours passed which came to me like minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
the door open and the morning light meets the space . &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I reply with the voice of an exhau@@ sting youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lord , my father must be troubled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be silent and run away , you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had freed me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a smoke in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends the majority of his time inside ; sometimes he locks on his canvas , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch .
what you can rely is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nic@@ otine de@@ filed lips .
he lives in the su@@ preme execution of his family house which had belonged to them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel had forced his occupation of the West@@ bank and fled from their village in Palestine where they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : farmers ) .
for more than six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist , which the conservative majority oppos@@ eth for gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ing .
with his music , which deals often with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of the Arab world . all these topics do not only find in his home town Amman relev@@ ance , but also in cities that from Damascus in Syria up to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his thinking , and he can feel with people who are under the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign inter@@ ventions in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not open it openly , he calls for a special en@@ vious against the American foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b visits his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who have attempted to do in war zones , do anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian legisl@@ ative of the second generation , &quot; even if he was born in Jordan .
&quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own living conditions , &quot; said H@@ d@@ ai@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think I &apos;m a man , while he &apos;s dissolved in water in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan . in this time it is provided for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also says that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ adan .
obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness of breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the s@@ wig do the warm coffee and the wa@@ ver of the K@@ ent @-@ C@@ igar@@ ette in the nose into the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when taking a look into neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to avoid basic things - as in public during the Ram@@ adan water - to avoid not in prison .
recently , the Interior of the Interior adopted a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila , for the second time .
some parliamentary groups that support the Islamic Republic of Action - argu@@ ing that sexual orientation of the hom@@ osex@@ ual fron@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , contra@@ dict the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country and the main reason for the concert tables .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pu@@ ties and former press spokes@@ woman in the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cancelled due to sexual orientation of the prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many claim that involvement of the band in affairs as the Arab Spring , human rights and free speech expression in the Arab world may be more dangerous than author@@ itarian regim@@ es in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila called the j@@ ord@@ an people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continues to use for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement may not be simply being the rh@@ etor@@ ic of the rh@@ etor@@ ic , an increasingly crystal clear reality reflected in Jordan , which seems to be clear in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b learned traditional gender nor@@ ms to body by preventing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex @-@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a clearly down ramp@@ aged unknown woman whose arms and legs are extended up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who they actually trust .
in the past years , the number of &apos; hon@@ our@@ able &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
human Rights Watch predic@@ ts its cul@@ mination in 2016 . however , the number of hon@@ our@@ able infrastructure is still lacking that Jordan has become the institutional infrastructure , in order to aid women , victims of attempted murder , or domestic violence .
according to a law gover@@ ning failure in 1954 , women who are exposed to danger of internal @-@ family violence , &quot; and for their release is often necessary for years of bureau@@ cratic effort , as well as the guarantee from the family that the woman will not happen .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs Music also enjoys great popularity and is well known to fri@@ gh@@ ten some topics in his country as t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b stri@@ ving that his work is political , however , dre@@ amt that he is his music that is full of explic@@ it beliefs on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of expression , not part of politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
I was pro@@ ver@@ ted in politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos; ed , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the focus again on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs , which are in essence , can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get what you want &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - be faith or dis@@ belief , H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noticed that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of co@@ ils and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T individuals will be sharp@@ ly cen@@ sored by 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b introduced an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an On@@ line@@ program Ro@@ ya , in order to mem@@ ori@@ ze his comments from the context , twi@@ sted and his mind were cen@@ sored .
&quot; on Youtube , without any inc@@ isions , it was uploaded without any inc@@ isions , but only a worked version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b bu@@ ys openly for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that in@@ tolerance is not dis@@ cour@@ aged by homosexu@@ als .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ das , a poet of the eighth century , still has remained remembered today thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Hur@@ am , who should work once again on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why is Jord@@ an@@ ians not that ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , has nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila , or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service concluded several former government officers and members of the teacher , with the grounds that they had critic@@ ized in social media critical problems dealing with the deeply rooted in the land .
in view of this , the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s opinion is according to the tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to make a structural changes in the next generation of Jord@@ an@@ ians .
for him , progress is a stand@@ alone and take . Jordan has now denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - this is what H@@ d@@ ai@@ b exists . it is sure that this changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
finally , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs , from an Arab world without inter@@ ventions from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he dre@@ aming not only to bring his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region is gras@@ ped by using music , art and literature in a real and basic op@@ enness - and not through bombs , stre@@ amed positions and on artificial nature . at least he hopes that .
until that time , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is going to ra@@ p and thus also resist resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
this great , extravag@@ ant war dolls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is assumed that it is celebrated as a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually ha@@ unted in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ kus and from time to time , in the army invaded the region of Japan , to force the indigenous people of the region , the Em@@ ishi to force the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab a few great places , so we have a great view .
you can imagine just how big these parts are ...
a common centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( lit@@ t@@ l ) .
I &apos;ve been looking for a long time on the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en : two p@@ ush@@ chairs have just been seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true and a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 meter high tower was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against sciss@@ ors and straight razor

rarely , outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peruvian youth from crime , and to promote a legitim@@ ate vocation like those of the Hair@@ For@@ war@@ der .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific ocean , close to the historical center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street smo@@ ked and illegal drug traff@@ icking are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region don &apos;t feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other intermediate and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has led to more norm in the experienced hands of hair@@ dresser , which can make these lav@@ ish hair@@ styles .
an un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired a annual event , the competition of hair@@ dresser &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there will be experts each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric rows , as you can see in the following video ( other videos on current competitions is available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to obtain their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools , which enables them to find work in the hair@@ styl@@ ing .
motivated by this activity and the evol@@ ving opportunities , dozens of young people saw that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion .
before the school year , the school offered special training workshops and reported to some of their successes :
in 1995 , we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district , where we are very proud , for we have built this educational community for children .
Colombia : love Letters to Guer@@ illa Battle
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the revised version of &quot; lovers of love messages &quot; which published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to men who know ?
is it not even more important , people who feel out@@ cast , affection ?
this question was precisely the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired her to write letters to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la RE@@ TAR@@ aci@@ ón ( letters for recon@@ ciliation ) .
only recently , their country was the venue of an historical event , and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian Government concluded a peace agreement with the Guer@@ ill@@ a@@ Movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) , which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was the sign of the peace agreement as such a significant event that Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services .
however , before colum@@ bi@@ an@@ ists , however , there is a long way until one can speak of a true recon@@ ciliation and peace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ err@@ illa &apos;s strug@@ gles who have lived in illegal camps for many years , and around the clock had to carry out their weapons in their arms , and have to integrate into life as civilians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who used to acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hat@@ red , has to take action in their ranks and support it in the building of a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young Colum@@ bi@@ ans would close together and would have to help with the integration process .
and exactly this they did , as far as thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former Guer@@ illa forces to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa war - who shall be handed over to personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for Recon@@ ciliation was developed on the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize that took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to talk with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this stated that we love the people who love to write thousands of love letters , but those who need them much more need@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is planning to share his love with people this year , with the most urgent need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the plan to write letters of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC who now have to build their place in society and establish a new life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make a dis@@ course of a history of peace , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they say . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i had never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on March 19th in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from the University J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the City Cooperation of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art re@@ arrange the camps to person@@ alize the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC set themselves on how they used to meet the leaders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of shel@@ tered persons from all over the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a very moving moment for all those involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings in just a few hours go through - from fear to happiness and everything that is between , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former mil@@ it@@ ant led me through the camp of the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( a kind of cottage , in which the gu@@ err@@ illa battle live ) I saw an err@@ illa battle that wrote something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was afraid to go down because beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ ro@@ wer , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty sleep .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I spoke to him anyway , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they just do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering a letter which someone wrote me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life was someone written to me something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my tears suddenly ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I em@@ brac@@ ed him completely , and sat down beside the Gren@@ ade La@@ un@@ cher .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe he was sorry for all the years of faithful companions to be this fighting , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life as war . when the F@@ ARC had never expected , it was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the hunger strike . &quot; I never thought that someone would have forgiven me for my mistake .
but now I know that there is a company outside , waiting for us with open arms .
until now I just learned how to handle weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace re@@ igns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
at the pre@@ lu@@ de , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC leaders were already in secret .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declar@@ es the history of the organization , their ide@@ als , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many years we have experienced the ability to develop us to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this order , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people heard that before had never seen hearing nor had no choice , and to recognize that people who often have seen as monsters and even hate them , who were turned around by their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ oods and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reality , in which the country lives , doesn &apos;t hurt me .
but comfort me that all men - including those who have killed and so much damage , give us a bit of a smile and a hug .
many former fighters answer the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
colum@@ bi@@ an@@ ists were proph@@ es@@ ied that peace would reign after the dis@@ arm@@ ament .
but that is not the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as it gives ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to raise up and protest to their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we from F@@ ARC now rely on peace , based on a policy without weapons .
therefore , we call all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of which race , religion or ide@@ ology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , because we know of your own experience that nothing is simple . that among us defend the life as the basis of existence , many difficulties are im@@ min@@ ent .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ osex@@ ual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror , activists have seen the coverage of the last months above the persecution of E@@ uler men in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but the men@@ ace , which depends on the LGB@@ TI community over the situation of LGB@@ T community , has not been created just over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to it what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LGB@@ T legal situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines after several months , after reports were published , which cover the tow , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina at Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , who took suspic@@ ious que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
she felt a woman since her childhood , that she was a woman in reality .
when they grew up , she became aware that Che@@ chn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which was why she moved to Moscow .
after a group had experienced Che@@ chens from the gender equality of her land@@ lady , the hunt was opened to Sab@@ rina .
she was afraid of her life in the last du@@ des in the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day , someone told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , somebody , from whom I thought , he would be a friend , a copy of my documents , and spread it everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . so there are no men more in Che@@ chn@@ ya , who can eliminate these dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that the pictures from my documents were made by the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was just doing some shopping spots from my car back seat , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt me .
then I heard a set , but this time to Che@@ chn@@ yan : &quot; how long do you still need to join the family , O Sch@@ and@@ stain@@ s ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost awareness and last du@@ des in the hospital again .
apparently some women had to get started and started scre@@ aming .
the man was fled .
the women were called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two wor@@ ms in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which hospitals you have been placed - in which men or women have ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor drew and laid me for the women .
for this I am very grateful .
when I read his name for the first time in his office I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ cas@@ ian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him for being respec@@ t@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote to me - Rel@@ ated , stranger , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relative .
the desired to send me back to Che@@ chn@@ ya , to prove that it was all a lie .
they released absurd claims : some said to me , I must prove it by running through the roads ; others wanted to appear in the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex to say that everything was only bad talking , and Photoshop .
I have bas@@ k @-@ size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how has your family tried to handle this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still difficult for them .
some older people once said my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world not only your family but the whole of the republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you , because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother became too much and she put on a kn@@ it around the neck .
luck@@ ily the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window a car with dark window washers and a license plate with a 95 .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was some la@@ zy .
my Human Rights Friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how are you bra@@ ided ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something unbelievable .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without sign up , without notice , without notice , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
came and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you &apos;re in security only because you have left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you know , in which hotel you hide . you even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it is number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and sisters .
however , about gender equality is not speaking , this is a tab@@ oos .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ cas@@ ian elements in me .
so much I wish that these spiritual barrier can &apos;t overcome this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always say that as long as my mother is in life , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when we chat with camera , I &apos;m really strug@@ gling to look like the person that she reminds her of her past - so in my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed more information about the situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who had inj@@ ected the one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ adan there was no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will focus on family and family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so my I , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; glory &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have experienced in blood co@@ ag@@ itation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : are men still gay men in these secret pris@@ ons now ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of me says , there would be not many .
if , most of all those who have no rich relatives or which were dropped by their relatives , to prove Kad@@ y@@ rows judgment .
as far as I know , they will be detained , so that they can present them later than terror@@ ists .
say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim they could have attacked any village or military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply gone , they are specifically sub@@ du@@ ed to radic@@ alize .
OC Media : is it just a guess or do you have a source of this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote anyone who was imprisoned at about one and a half months .
he says that many people have gone up in this prison after their beard grew grown .
there has been nothing new of them since .
they just took them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was involved when these people were taken .
however , until now they were not presented as band@@ its , in addition there were no reports yet . we susp@@ ect that such actions are quite possible .
why would it not have been allowed to shave this man ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always brought my hair long time .
in Che@@ chn@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think , before 2003 I was already in the whole Gros@@ ny , when I was still alive there - and I never had problems .
in the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 when Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia was originally intended to lead us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil society &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but finally took us back to the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyebrows were plu@@ cked ; I had coloured eyelashes , bore tube je@@ ans and short tops .
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never been cro@@ oked for me .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , mainly on weekends , a whole group of people met with me .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and all the city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a phr@@ ase : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t say about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just have their eyes closed before you , because they believed they are sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never ins@@ ulted me , never ch@@ ased and never struck .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov re@@ signed to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he started speaking about mor@@ ality on television .
he spoke not about us by se , but primarily on women &apos;s behavior .
nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city .
who laughed and laughed at once , looked at once with suspicion .
in the meantime , I left Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic has shifted steadily .
OC Media : which activities are you going on now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ iter .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the US are not much .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ et@@ ffs , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get Essen@@ tial cards .
I have no p@@ enny for it .
I discovered these people themselves when I kl@@ ad@@ ore refuge .
I am Muslims and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ arms .
so nature is nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is exactly the same as Che@@ chens , who want to tell you with foam before your mouth , that there are no co@@ ils with them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ians have , who have the Cab@@ ard@@ ines who have the Russians also on the whole planet - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Not in Che@@ chn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from there , I come from there , so it is un@@ pleasant to hear that .
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
do you know , many think about Tran@@ si@@ dent@@ ity about males who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a dec@@ eption .
these are two different things - two different types of feeling to be precise , different habit@@ ats .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and do not harm me for my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry that I &apos;m getting personally so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warning in Iran an increase of self @-@ murder within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
there has been a strong increase in confidence since the last few months .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man called Jas@@ ho@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 drew on the des@@ perate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran , characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the li@@ mel@@ ight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ ra@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was com@@ promising for his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness to come up in@@ ability to his family , such as Ah@@ mad @-@ human rights groups who want to work and remain anonymous in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
a video shared on YouTube watched the moments after he had kind@@ led himself .
some people made it quick to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken into the se@@ ap@@ hani hospital in the city of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
local sources , the burns were so strong that physi@@ cians could do nothing more .
he died short time later .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arabian Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ Min@@ ority , and activists from on @-@ site make sure more men could take life .
this month , the An@@ c@@ azi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Man@@ i@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have one thing in common : it was all family pat@@ ter that felt hel@@ pl@@ ess and felt unable to feed their families and to keep their families .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffering under poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , which is a large part of the Arab @-@ owned Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community living in Iran , has been sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to dispute their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ monarchy took power and in 1925 did great efforts to end the ethnic autonomy in all Iran .
in the A@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran forward oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most important and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources the regional economy continue to evol@@ ve only slowly , and the local population gets only little from this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated disease , hunger and ag@@ itation .
the Iranian regime refuse to conduct their jobs system@@ atically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also built a multitude of dam@@ s , which lie water from the Arab territories in the Persian regions , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ hom lie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these dam@@ s have led only to waste the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness caused by dr@@ y@@ ness and to destroy local farming as well as the fish and palm trees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ spir@@ zi rose now to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of co@@ operative , work and social welfare , report that 5 % of the pedi@@ atri@@ cians who are looking for a job , completed 55 % a secondary school and have 45 % a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ bl@@ azi Human rights activ@@ ist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Global Vo@@ ices , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Global Vo@@ ices , a mixture of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high rise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the number of self @-@ moral leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Doh@@ im@@ i said that especially unemployment has become worse for unemployment . reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ ra@@ z ane@@ an@@ upcoming ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
since officials and institutions pre@@ fers non @-@ Arab workers , the local Arabian Ah@@ w@@ azi will have access to work opportunities in all sectors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood outside their homeland of Ah@@ ra@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are people who had to hide their ancest@@ or and sur@@ name to be conc@@ e@@ aled and so hired , because even Arab names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace , for the speech of the Arabic language or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arabic clothing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the circumstances given to the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi , human rights activ@@ ist alarm before the situation will explo@@ de .
it remains to wait if the world is w@@ aking up and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .

&quot; why I do not identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ section . &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons License .
the following article is an revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was an object of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression .
they can be found in the comments under the original text .
if I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who describe themselves as an inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with frustr@@ ation .
you wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * within .
for example , women nowadays still earn less money in spite of equal education than men .
that women are still under strict observ@@ ations , when it comes to what they can do with her body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that cultural and social standards ensure that women so@@ oner or later encounter a glass ceiling in various fields of life , and discrimination based on the sex is still passing through the many different countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced of it and I was suffering double and triple below .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I &apos;m coming to speak on skin color , on black tran@@ si@@ ve@@ al women , on black tran@@ si@@ gence women , to black women in the LGB@@ TI community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention , as we have always used in rac@@ ec@@ centric , mental and verbal jobs , many white femin@@ ists decide to keep silence inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but nevertheless , all agree that women - all women - come together to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lift up their voices and sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to achieve equality for equality ( some ) women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about that , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institutional form of motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or that black women and women of other ethnic and origin are less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls are deported to the school more often than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spher@@ es and women with a mig@@ rant background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all men to do all males and all human rights . on the other hand , I cannot connect to a movement in whose center the white woman ref@@ uses to consider the in@@ just@@ ices in their thinking , which relate to the gender as well as to the skin colour of a person .
I &apos;m exhausted and will not fight for my membership in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that always has rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 1851 , in her speech , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also refused to maintain a ide@@ ology , in which the black woman is a fundamental and mar@@ gin@@ alized nature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups of group@@ ings , which as@@ simil@@ ated by cultural ex@@ propri@@ ation our customs and customs in order to advance their eg@@ o@@ centric program .
I will not try to define white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping of skin color and gender . because some of them continue to keep the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to give them a better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism has been set up to set up women from different places and restri@@ ct itself from the white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I take it before , to join me full of femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was so persistent for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of me for a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m , that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women in our own ideas and take us into the spher@@ es that we are created for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson River We@@ ems , the author of Africa &apos;s wom@@ an@@ ism : rec@@ laim@@ ing O@@ ur@@ selves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we can defend ourselves in this way , in which they can also defend ourselves totally and in which the cultural , spiritual , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements could be ven@@ er@@ ated that make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists instantly call separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion , after they have read these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contra@@ dictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift up black women and women of other cultures , as in this para@@ dig@@ m I existed .
I will be recognized as part of this para@@ dig@@ m because of my dark skin and because of my being .

this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in@@ particular about international efforts to solve environmental issues .
as part of a share @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be published again .
but again , Nabil San@@ a traveled to Iraq last 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in the can@@ oe - with a particular concern through the Kurdistan Regional Region of Iraq . its mission aims to make people conscious of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation of Emily Kin@@ s@@ key we follow Mus@@ a , who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; I really wanted to do something for the river which we lost when I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells him .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , the pollution and the un@@ controlled development , lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation water@@ keeper Alliance - a subsidiary of Water@@ keeper Alliance - which uses and works to protect &quot; the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as the local communities in sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the video Mus@@ a summar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this video was produced for En@@ zi@@ an Emily Kin@@ s@@ key , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq @-@ based documentary filmm@@ aker and multimedia journalist , filmed and published .
the focus of her work is on pursued , little substantial sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co@@ operative video photography and new multimedia techniques , with their help to help them tell their stories in her way .
Paraguay women and her difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their sorrow on women &apos;s mor@@ ality in the country and in the region to express their re@@ jection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ do . the article belongs to the series of # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # ko@@ lich@@ en@@ ef@@ ski@@ bin ) , which is reported on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the persons affected .
a police Commissioner said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could not do anything against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who had become violent .
since the end of their relationship was passed and the police said , her testimony would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena proved to be mist@@ re@@ ated because of abuse , the accurate display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was evident .
a few days later the second woman moved her ad back .
breaking the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women once again ad@@ dict , they generally do not receive support from the stage .
in many cases , women are also dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who ad@@ mit to be victims of violence in all cases of prosec@@ utions .
inhal@@ ation 1 blo@@ ws and statistics 2 un@@ seen mist@@ re@@ acts and a legal system , that nothing infer@@ ior to Paraguay laws : good approach , poor implementation of impacts and statistics
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to see how many women are really mis@@ used , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , a social research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are various information and reports which , but not even an@@ sat@@ in , the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the available figures however are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the At@@ tor@@ ney General launched 9@@ 600 indicators because of domestic violence . at 70 % it was about violence against women .
86 % of indications when police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence in the peace of peace . 86 % of women &apos;s ads came here .
in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically badly used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics show however not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only few of these off@@ ences will be shown , too . &quot; on every woman who are reimbur@@ sed in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
there are two women who do not do this for physical abuse on each woman who do not do this , &quot; she explained in late 2014 .
since the killing of Paraguay has no own criminal law , the prosecution authorities cannot appropri@@ ately document how many women have been murdered by their current or former partners .
alone up to August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country .
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay has at least 37 cases where women have been murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies off violence by men .

invisible mis@@ ery and a legal system that prevents nothing
before Mariana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the strong friend of Carlos Vera , he in@@ sist@@ ed that she called his name to all of her former friends .
she did not want to do that in the beginning , but after that she was supposed to regret it forever .
today , Mariana is 28 years old and has no longer concer@@ ted with Carlos . but for two years , she carried out psych@@ ic violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult :
I never thought that I would once become victims of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I thought that only women happened to be sub@@ ordin@@ ated , because they don &apos;t be fool@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mariana uses social media to report on the mist@@ re@@ ation by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described its ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he isolated it .
many people responded to their posts , including Carlos himself . he asked to rh@@ etor@@ ic , if he ever charged the hand against them and refused to ad@@ mit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had enjoyed this so long by Carlos and didn &apos;t break it earlier .
it almost seemed like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain blame .
Victoria Santos , which is not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that her former partner was har@@ assed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ o te Cre@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) that are all victims of abuse in any way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk with others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the testimony of women seriously .
in Victor@@ ias case everything began with psychological abuse .
her weal@@ thy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Victoria &apos;s ads with the authorities were without a result and also of their relatives , she received no support .
she led a trial against her former partners who developed into an imper@@ ative legal struggle between Paraguay and its home country where it was mainly for money , power and influence of her former partners .
Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws which are very good but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the abuse of abuse is a way full of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in the application of laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill of legislation was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # Inter@@ phone ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ one L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign based on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law sees to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent crime , and harder to pun@@ ish as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
in some points , the legisl@@ ative text was altered in some points to ensure that the de@@ pu@@ ties are denied to de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions which are actually banned in Paraguay and may be punished with up to five years in prison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original draft Bill has planned to carry out the bulk of ( bureau@@ cratic and economic ) case , which only need to carry out the victims of violence itself , if they simply want to commit to the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law does not be effective if the legisl@@ ature must not provide sufficient financial means :
in Paraguay , abuse are seen as part of inter@@ human relationships .
here , a change must take place , so that violence is not considered more than something normal .
those who keep silent about this facts , and bear witness to that the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators .
we have to continue for so long time until mist@@ re@@ ation is no longer considered to be normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the Law in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate was adopted . however , parts of the law was altered , but amongst others , a passage was painted , which the partners shou@@ ted into domestic violence .
opinions about the changes go apart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the section regarding recon@@ ciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor , to attack his victim again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the cancellation of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sex &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of parts of the law is regarded as great respect . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman dre@@ ad@@ ful to ban a newspaper on attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago the Ottoman authorities have closed the independent Arab newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their coverage of corruption in the Sult@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to jail , where he served a prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , were also arrested and tried and tried again later .
Oman has been ruled since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid after he came to power after he had set his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Ober@@ ster commander , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Minister of Foreign Affairs and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan of sult@@ ans is characterized by the most thorough efforts of security forces , in particular by domestic meetings , to restri@@ ct and def@@ ending human rights def@@ ending , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities det@@ ri@@ ct peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in human rights , and activists , also activists , and their views on the public affairs of the country like corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , her closure , and the detention three of her editors in the last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , where it was reported on corruption in Oman since its inc@@ eption in 2007 , until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , established , after appearing in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 , after corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in judi@@ cial decisions .
in the report , government officials were accused of raising the judge of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a sentence in a possession .

on 3 August 2016 , Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , a member of the Board of Directors , was charged from the ISS before the Special Department and arrested on his arrival from the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the dep@@ uty editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who was acting as a chief editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari &apos;s arrest .
the newspaper was closed down in@@ definite time after the information ministry has given the statement , &quot; the publication and dis@@ semin@@ ation of the newspaper on any way , including online , starting on August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial took place in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri .
the Court sentenced three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final shut@@ down of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convicted , because of distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; Under@@ bur@@ ial of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of a public ban and the s@@ lan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j was sentenced to three year jail pen@@ alties and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic vines ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a one @-@ year career was imposed on both journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ab@@ ri was condemned to a year jail and a fine of 1000 R@@ ial ( 2600 US dollars ) after having been using &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information network to spread material that could represent a danger for the public order &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , a damages deposit of 5000 om@@ anic vines ( 13 000 US dollars ) has been set , and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Court of Appeals acquitted of Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced to six months of imprisonment for Al @-@ Ha@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was dischar@@ ged from the central prison in Mas@@ cat on April 10th , 2017 . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served his prison sentence .
the Court of Appeal adopted the decision of the Ministry of Labour to include the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the court to re@@ mit Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper sees itself as before attacks by the Japanese government .
on 8 January the Minister of Information appointed a statement to pro@@ long the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; for three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and the Minister assigned a further time to the decision of the Appeals Court .
the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists in the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman has recently been viol@@ ated in Oman .
for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the discharge of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper in the country to set up its operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not willing to end an end to the extensive violation of press freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the om@@ anic authorities :
1 . You@@ Jó@@ z@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j to leave and un@@ condition@@ ally free ;
2. to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , so that their journalists can work their job ;
3 . protect the press freedom in the country , and
4 . in all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitim@@ ate human rights work without fear and without fear , including judi@@ cial pen@@ ic@@ ants .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non@@ governmental organization founded in the Gulf region and adjacent states by promotion of Mein@@ - and association , and the right to gather together peace@@ fully , and provides them with protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely reported or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area addressed to one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for medical research on site : there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines to cover the specific medical requirements on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria have more serious implic@@ ations in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries in Africa , and lack of investments in the research of these diseases by the Phar@@ m@@ af@@ ir@@ men are a big problem .
second , research , which is carried out by African scientists , helps to develop their own research capacities in Africa . major role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the centr@@ al@@ ab@@ ors centre for the research of inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , when the AIDS epidemic showed its first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Louisiana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself worked on the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to assist the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings of the media about this research .
disc@@ laim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work on the application of research results . thereby I assist the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I also developed a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant disease path@@ o@@ gens .
G@@ V : what are your opinion according to the important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always keep the receiver instead of being al@@ acher .
the solutions that we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is to find suitable scientists for projects ?
RW : USA and Europe .
the projects will be funded differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or withdraw here , as financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work which you did not before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not conform to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import from other countries .
G@@ V : what is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods in schools ought to be taught to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need of special academic education , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and efficiency of traditional medicine will greatly benefit .
G@@ V : can you describe the advantages and draw@@ backs of life as scientists in Africa compared to Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and license access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges .
the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental issues worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on bred already in the United States since the 1980s .
its company has 114 types , such as Out@@ red@@ der , the first plant that has been cultivated and consum@@ es by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ ons &apos; work has been set by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question how many sal@@ ads can get there .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noted that more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not continue to re@@ bre@@ w them for this reason .
the patents are not only for single varieties , but also for certain qualities as resistance to diseases , a special rotor or green or curved leaves .
over the past years more of such patents have been registered on more plants such as cereals or cardboard . based on these trends , plants and experts provide food safety to ensure the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , Mort@@ on is still a salad he needs no longer , since its work is always worth more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like a b@@ oul@@ ders lying in a river to which I have to d@@ ump@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents go far to sal@@ ads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before court , no one can breed a new sal@@ ute , because all the features are patented , so it &apos;s so good as possible and tries to breed those features that he would like .
however , it is very careful and tries to use no material that is protected as a intellectual property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also joined a movement which is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bre@@ eders ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the station . there we have been testing whether plants are grown in space . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is no co@@ incidence that this name sounds rather as though the movement from the IT @-@ area would come and not from the field of plant breeding .
open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the motion for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was initiated into life in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , and can be used permanently for plant bre@@ eders .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bre@@ eders could ple@@ dge to use that others can use the seed alive free of them .
however , this does not mean that they can continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; -@@ bre@@ eders only allow others to breed their seed , to cross it as own varieties , and do not immediately out@@ crops - two aspects , which are banned or prescribed by many plant pat@@ rons .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
sin@@ c@@ ere prospects
for the Emer@@ itus Professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i , CEO Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over seed and the possibility to grow new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds are likely to play a role in larger combinations such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would attempt to use the latter , not only little using natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg st@@ resses that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement is not busy with gene@@ tically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from organic agriculture or not . &quot; to achieve our aim of ecological sustainability in the global agricultural industry , it should also know that in August or September 2016 , we should also know that the way in which this vegetables are cultivated , is threatened .
food so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty without seed su@@ pre@@ m@@ ity is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to providing others their seed still freely available , in contrast to the seed , seed and plant characteristics .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters may argue that the future of food supply is endangered because the available gene pool is due to the increasing intellectual property rights of plant material that is thus always reduced , in@@ sensitive to shr@@ inking .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability . it found out that approximately one @-@ third of all the map features are protected as intellectual property , whereby it is usable for plant bre@@ eders either at all or not only ar@@ able .
there are not such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass @-@ grown plants are patented as wheat in more extensive style as let@@ tu@@ ce or carrots .
a Mat@@ ter of Vis@@ ions
plants are so bred that they have specific undes@@ irable features - from such , by which their taste or their colour improves until such , because of which they prosp@@ er in certain environments , such as p@@ ests or diseases .
ad@@ vers@@ aries of patents on plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is decreasing by ever more patents . but nowadays , genetic vari@@ ability be more need@@ less than ever since the changes in climate change are much worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s spokesperson in Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to , that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four co@@ ats and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preservation of genetic variety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , she contra@@ dic@@ ts that intellectual property fails to restri@@ ct other bre@@ eders , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ ances for innovations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan to follow everyone as soon as the patent is up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method of the same result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection will not in@@ hibit innovation , but promotes the public more material and know @-@ how to be made available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mort@@ on looks very different : 20 years waiting for a patent . this would certainly not result any innovation .
and if you have to wait so long for plants , which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources still have been a common good and it should remain , neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary inc@@ enti@@ ves are not attractive for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to make farmers easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us , and it will be impossible for us if we don &apos;t continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Mort@@ on is based on the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the features .
they form the plants themselves and as bre@@ eders , we have no idea how the plants do it .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US @-@ state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i member board , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; who bred a variety , also provides its own values into it .
who believes in the industrial farming with great farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for which cultiv@@ ating Her@@ bi@@ zi@@ de are needed , who cultiv@@ ates this concept of agriculture .
my concept is opposite . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , it is the most smaller seed companies to survive - either simply refuse the patented or they do it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders would be innovative through the avoid@@ ance of plant pat@@ rons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that are patented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I need new material for my catalog since I know that my competitors are going to sell my varieties in a couple of years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a patent for 20 years , it is quite easy to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the USA seem to be a leader in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in India , the center for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which itself describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed program works by farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that fulfill specific requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seed and sell their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organisation agreements operates on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for breeding are different from country to country , because the O@@ ss@@ i obligation can not simply be one thing to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive committee of the European Union , the European Commission , declar@@ es that the conventional plants should not be patented . thus , she speaks about the current practice of the European Patent Office , which contains patents on conventional plants .
however , there is no law , however ; it is now in governments of the Member States to bring patent for this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , to farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives from whole East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend for ornam@@ entation of seeds .

a merger from environmental and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non@@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and its concentration - Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Essen@@ es - a ban from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - publishes a report that farmers may have to share it and improve the seed policy , thus providing a stable supply of food .
the report also emphas@@ izes the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection , by the Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i , hopes that more people will see him soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the motion for regional and ecological foods have primarily ge@@ ared where and as something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now try to make people clear that more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
on the weekend of 05.@@ August the Egyptian government locked up the Arabic network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt , as well as the Arab world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August the network released a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ized the Egyptian authorities for this step , and promised to continue work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Arabic network for Human Rights Information , despite this attack and sub@@ jection of the Egyptian law and the Constitution , should defend itself to its goal , to continue to resolve the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , and even though it has never been so difficult to overcome these objectives and do not recre@@ ate them . we &apos;re waiting to fulfill our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked off the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ speaking edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the network of Qatar for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of wave of web sites to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i represents one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic , htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / N@@ IZ@@ M@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ est and human rights scientist Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada used his blog on the spread of columns and articles that he does not write to in@@ accessible websites and media in Egypt .
now , the blog , which he built to circum@@ vent the c@@ ens@@ ist of the Egyptian government , even target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider of that also called Zi@@ adas blog , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 and recorded a video , as he exerc@@ ised physical violence against two students .
its products are mainly about policy and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment Zi@@ ada said to the lock by the government and reflected what this means for him :
the , Blogs to Lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It is successful for them to medi@@ ate the feeling of a siege of arrest ; an arrest , an attempted murder , sum@@ m@@ ons at the National Security Council , the barriers of blogs , and any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You proved that I was not writing for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used to handle items to handle c@@ ens@@ orship .
now , after having locked it and that they may be afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cour@@ iers go to the end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities locked up technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , among others Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers by integr@@ ating internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( VP@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 we noticed how the barriers of websites that VP@@ N@@ s began .
such practice indicates the intention of the government to block and filter content to the Egyptian users .
the situation is also wor@@ sen@@ ed that the cen@@ sored decisions are taken behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which they can perform against this action .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and whom will it be next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the residents are fighting .

day for day newspapers in Brazil with a mis@@ leading head@@ lines made by Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard mot@@ ifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every second day , a police officer murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die@@ gr@@ rau@@ ben Phar@@ m@@ acy with military weapons &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air Force to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a well @-@ called financial situation the violence reached the highest level in 2017 in Rio .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called to attack the United Nations .
the reports such as these are all day and this is un@@ acceptable and # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is how the detailed reporting of violence in the Rio known newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on August 16th was published , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which they ceased to set up a new category called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the paper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex @-@ breaking , etc . all , what happened from ci@@ v@@ il@@ ised standard and what is only happened in Rio . ( ... ) This is our way to cry : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so as journalists do not close our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , that this decision was no reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war@@ rior in a country that cannot realize the war .
the same video explains a journalist in the newspaper , that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas , there are many criminal organisations .
in the Editorial the newspaper writes :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware that a war dis@@ course if it is dist@@ orted , even if it can be used , atro@@ cities of the police , who only sho@@ ots and then asks questions to fail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the m@@ af@@ ia and their partners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
will the name &quot; war &quot; harm more than them ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argu@@ ed to describe the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a just@@ ification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it harder , responsible for police force .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as shown by the analysis of the military rates in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investments in personnel , recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance and a historical and self @-@ counter@@ le@@ ct of the public service .
in the memory : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Rio de Janeiro , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities are in Brazil , according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no such cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
if we have a look at the murder rates per state , Rio is on position 16 , &quot; she writes .
specially belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , which , as Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been under@@ taking the security policy of the State since years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to these safety policies , the foundation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Pac@@ if@@ ic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit created by the State of Rio in 2003 , is to conquer a fav@@ ela by making use of a massive police package and make one unit permanently . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at first , this was in fact led to a decrease of for@@ ci@@ ble deaths . since a few years , the U@@ PP was supposed to protect from ch@@ ic@@ ans and re@@ pression against poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio doesn &apos;t exceed the criteria for the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil war &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as the war also suggests severe consequences for human beings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this calls for the state to employ means and ways that are typical of a war . to this end , the in@@ tru@@ sion into the territory of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belongs to the landscape and an object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ver@@ ted balls &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
war or her , fact is that the residents of the fav@@ el@@ as will continue to suffer in Rio .
a week it is now that police attacked the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ galvan@@ ho , to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident was made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots taken by police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besie@@ ged Syri@@ ans , mushrooms

since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime to loy@@ alist forces .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib in one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons took the lives of hundreds of civilians on August 21 , 2013 .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition go on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organizations that the massacre was carried out by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these from rebels have been under siege under siege under siege under siege , which led to those that residents are made on local or through tun@@ nels and control points of dis@@ cour@@ aged food .
due to the years of block@@ ade traditional food products such as meat become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; lif@@ es@@ aving food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i do not belong to the traditional , planted foods in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian kitchen . however , it makes it an attractive supplement for many residents of the besie@@ ged east gh@@ out@@ a .
the direct from the project , Ab@@ o Nabil , faced with the French News agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate fung@@ i as they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ahmed Le@@ ila , one of the organiz@@ ers , reported Global Vo@@ ices for the last three years , that this project was well @-@ known , and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at public@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to collect money for the initiative you use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to arrange 125 families of knowledge for plant@@ ing mushrooms , as Dr. Le@@ ila to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have achieved over 100 % of their expected target of approximately 12.@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations from Can@@ do by Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel short@@ age , local chemicals made of plastic are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Le@@ ila told &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Global Vo@@ ices &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they started with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
afterwards they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when they succeeded , they used a larger tub . so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apprenti@@ ce farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in the East Gh@@ out@@ a .
Dr. Le@@ ila declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people the fungus for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ care by eating food remains ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc . ) for the extraction of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women to work at home .
to create new work@@ places for disabled people , which are bound to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world , so our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand for justice to the victims of 2017
several hundred people protest@@ ing on 21 October in many district cities in Portugal and demanded righteousness for the victims of the fires that died in the north of Portugal within the week .
two @-@ two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government of the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state of state .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ ic@@ ia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire erup@@ tions that spread in the northern and centrally located regions of the country and about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages did .
in June , in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest management system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos alone in 2017 , approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the Ernst of the situation : there are no fire in 4 bor@@ ou@@ ghs .

numerous videos spread in the network and show images that allow better insights into the action :
the se@@ eable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ ventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why civil protection was not in the position to inter@@ sec@@ t the extent of tragedy as far as possible
João So@@ ver@@ al declared the newspaper p@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o in Portugal :
according to Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did it nowhere : there are dozens of open roads closed by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria there would have been a similar tragedy in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
further , construction permits will be question@@ ed in locations with high fire tests .
an extensive proposal on the forest form which the government had brought in 2003 and 2005 , was ob@@ jected by the authorities , who saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle to investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a sl@@ ack@@ ening of the law that the applic@@ ant granted the case of case if the applic@@ ant had an open door , so that everything was built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same article the newspaper p@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Environmental Organization Quer@@ cus made aware that large surfaces with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees made of easily inflamm@@ able wood , like in a v@@ icious circle , to spread to fires of this species .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to these problems , the website of Portugal &apos;s civilian protection from Portugal on the 15th and 16th of October , sought to contact persons or attempted to contact people who were offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a private initiative which provided the population with information : it used your own civil protection data using f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt to the location and spread of fires .
the project was founded in 2015 by the developers João P@@ ina to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was so crucial that the servers followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users that followed the fires , did not count the website more than half a million .

during a night in the fall of 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan started by the Taliban .
two years ago , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ ja@@ he@@ din group , which had conquered the short @-@ lasting pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan became a country of terror and desp@@ air .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central af@@ gh@@ z@@ stan for the last time with his family at dinner together .
even if his mother never said it at that time , she didn &apos;t know that she could not see her son a long time - maybe even more .
in dawn the boy should break .
his uncle would fet@@ ch him , and bring him to the tow .

Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt dev@@ out suddenly .
the Taliban issued for their hat@@ red always came near@@ er to Haz@@ ara .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape A@@ shar@@ af was found in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ hes@@ ion pit . the work was hard and made him sick .
then he took what was left by his small reward , and went into Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged s@@ acks with mort@@ ars that were heavier than he himself to earn his living .
back then , like today , Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterised by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) had lived in an empty building on the building site on which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no services there and no heating . we mounted nylon before the open windows so that we don &apos;t indul@@ ge at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af had left his life without papers in Iran and made his way ready for the trip to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing over the sea he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek Auth@@ orities had rejected his application for asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af hom@@ eless , ran away alone through the streets of Rome , slept in Parks and went to a church who shared twice a day of food in host@@ ess .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for asylum seek@@ ers , but it is also true that the conditions for asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astroph@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human rights organisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffering from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers is accommodated in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special entrance centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; there is impro@@ vised equipment in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ qualified personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a admission center if they officially expressed an application for asylum , which can withdraw after the registration of the asylum request for months .
until then people who don &apos;t have money for accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
thus also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his ind@@ w@@ ab@@ ated life @-@ life helped A@@ shar@@ af to free oneself out of these conditions .
after he had made various works in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af put all the savings into the creation of a host@@ els in Venice .
it was so good that he still opened a second hostel after a while .
A@@ shar@@ af bar@@ at@@ is success story is now on the topic of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wah@@ id@@ i .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , for the first time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
lots of bureau@@ cracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a trans@@ itional solution to other European countries .
in recent years , some of the Afgh@@ an companies , including tail@@ oring , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of the Orient Experience restaurant , where the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the restaurant menu is told by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts , the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari , opened in Padua , opened the Restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na Pizzeria in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome also .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals have , however , go far beyond the Italian food industry and the retail sector , and aim back to the country that he had to leave due to teenage children .
&quot; where a risk is , there are possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my land and I cannot live happy if I know that my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and have the same possibilities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , which allows people to sell packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , they can sell their harvest on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through un@@ certainty and doub@@ ts , but towards the end stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans in this way .

the Egyptian Parliament will examine a bill , which sees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registration with a government authority .
users would have to use themselves to use social networks , in six months after the succ@@ es@@ ful decision on the website of the authority , specif@@ ying their complete name as well as their ID number .
those who have failed this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the final re@@ direction of a penalty .
the law that was applied by six@@ ty Members of Parliament is currently legisl@@ ative as well as the Parliament &apos;s constitutional committee , and shall be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may another dep@@ uty for a legisl@@ ative proposal in which harder pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult to the presi@@ dents or high officials would be introduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the Egyptian law , the ins@@ ult of the President and state facilities are already pun@@ ish@@ able . under the law , such a fact would be pun@@ ish@@ able with prison and money pun@@ ishments , so t@@ ailed by the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the Law has been adopted , this may mean until three years in prison for the convicted .
this would also be a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom has already been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) , when he had taken refuge in the Egyptian police , demonstr@@ ating violence against demonstr@@ ators , demonstr@@ ating against the demonstr@@ ators of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
for four years , Sha@@ w@@ kan waited for four years in detention to have been detained at the same incident .
recently , his trial was post@@ pon@@ ed to the hearing of 20 May , because the prison leadership failed to bring the accused from prison to the court hall .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty for one , so many human rights groups involved , ev@@ asion of arms , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza was acquitted of two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their coverage to pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties by the repor@@ ters Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , which were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunis@@ ian activists to be linked to sp@@ ill@@ ated documents
in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the f@@ ake of Sami Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was used mainly to a continuous action plan . Bes@@ ag@@ ter plan is supported by the President of the Republic , which , according to the plan , expressly acc@@ ru@@ ined to warrant the business@@ men and during the former regime , by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption of accused officials .
the document published on April 21 on the site of Na@@ wa@@ at casts a light on how the magnificent plans to support the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources using Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press code , which complic@@ ates journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , in the District Court of Tunis , on 9 May , he witnessed in the case .
will China force the users of social media to introduce their identity ?
according to the new rules of information offices of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users need social media in China to write or share news in social media .
in the regulations , it is indicated that registration with the full re@@ turn@@ able name will be required .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anal@@ ysts suppose that by the elim@@ ination of anonymous comments within social networks , it is un@@ clear to now how the authorities will apply these regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese network vou@@ chers , proposed in the social media , to impos@@ e this rules only sel@@ ective in order to protect the civil journ@@ alism and its independence .
then do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May the state c@@ ens@@ orship Russia locked the access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ com@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat decided to register as the &quot; organizer of the information selection &quot; in the provincial government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this name is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to the Russian government lists a list of online services , which also organis@@ es the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; publication of the Government &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the law also permits the Services to extract content and force them on request to use user data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these websites are currently belonging to websites like V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ classi@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has spar@@ es Wikipedi@@ as
a Turkish court dispos@@ ed the barriers of Lebanon after Wikipedia administ@@ rators refused to delete two English @-@ speaking articles , the indications that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication has been blocked because they collabor@@ ate on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a source of information which collabor@@ ates with groups to support a political diff@@ us@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey is completely blocked by Turkey , among others , China , one of the few countries world @-@ wide , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
