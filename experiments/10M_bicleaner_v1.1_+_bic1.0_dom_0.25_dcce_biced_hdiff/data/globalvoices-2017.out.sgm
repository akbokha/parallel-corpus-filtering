<seg id="1">Although I visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, American authors have picked American music and operated his sports.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a profoundly deep impact on me that I was mainly used for a American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When I was 14 years old, I saw the great Denzel Washington who played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, the murderous conspiracy of an oil-magnatter, which was inclined by the leading federal court with judges who had inclined his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "freely according to Method Man," "" "I was like the absolute truth, forget everything else that I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona had only increased my admiration for the US only.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "I always said," "" "America is the only country where I have ever lived whose diversity is so welcoming you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like minded people." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very warmer love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me how he dies with his engines.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as it says so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless people on their testimony responded and tuned in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won during the republican candidate, was the highest number that a Candidate rated by the Party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans to support this bigots, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not make bump and his voters in accordance with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, Professor Dr Bill Silcock, Director of the Journalism program, the people from all over the world, with whom I could maintain myself through Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trump's Weltanschauung did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the current publisher of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" playing.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerant also stands in contrast to generosity that I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought the environment for their lives, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">Still, she fits to the engagement of Kristi Kappi, which helped me with patience and grace to help me and my colleagues helped to accustom the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">We were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser council helped me much with my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those who embodied in them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump doing his way to nominate republican data, they offered me a stop and counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out to be, however, that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mainly white, are the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt towards non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people were voted for Trump, because they were either sharing its racism and fanaticism, because they were ready to oversee these things, almost the heart broke.</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it's unfair to call the Trump-voters as a rattle.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sending people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectless and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears are not taken into account of the hectic changes in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these vectors, of which most white, are voted for Trump, because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, perhaps they wanted to say that in this America they are still important?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "however, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick that evokes the cruel decision to raise a man who look upon those who look different than he." ""</seg>

<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background you always might have, America is always welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chosen as its President, twice the Son of a Kennel, whose story how he himself says that nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the choice Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: hell with multiplicity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the rue, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier, who fell in Iraq, and what he told on the eve of choice.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally of Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change to the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, Was my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a Place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" roared the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried and their voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"if anyone who doesn't work like you, have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO."</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan ended with words: "God be thanks, Mr. Trump, is that not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That's now Trump Land, the news said.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could find no more in this new America.</seg>

<seg id="69">What is the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguaic city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music, played at both places, has not only changed the lives of children but also a very close association with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby countryside and famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For a few years now La Banda de MÃºsica (Music bande) plays in the municipality: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, a possibility to overcome poverty in her musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A musical school with 100 students will become the central interest for the Vicente Guerrero community in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The church, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs abuse and gangs-violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who launched a musical project and offered a rare occurrence of hope in the youth.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group seriously, the local press noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty roads to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They come always laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the Truly you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that lies practically on the largest garbage dump of Asuncion in Paraguay, on instruments which are made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with restored instruments, made of local fixed waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycler has begun under the direction of Favio Chavez to transform parts of waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">Instruments imitate violins, viola, celli, contrabass, guitars, flutes, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made out of the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguib and Latin American music as well as music by the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chavez is reminiscent of a local economist and music teacher of the children of Cateura at the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach in the same place the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not collaborate with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown just what he had never seen before: a violin made from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments of restored footage and is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic's garbage dump) shows the musical achievement:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tonnes of rubbish every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and live are the moorest - like men in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play from garbage to music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fights for wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, published in a magazine that reported specifically about international, practiced solutions for environmental issues.</seg>
<seg id="99">The publishing is done as part of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing the shared use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa it was well known that this ship had already been operated illegal fishing in the Western coast before it was the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">"" "" "" "the East African countries were brought accordingly, and little inclined to welcome a criminal law of this kind in their coasts." ""</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the computors, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to share one of her harbors and refused to share their fisherman.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries, which you simply refuse all" "", "reminds of Benedict Kiilu, a senior executive of the Kenyan fishing agency. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was driven out of the region's waters: it wasn't succeeded to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for pillaging the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a Network of countries, 2012 from the NRO Stop Fishing Fishing (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, members of this network are the six countries who had expelled the Premier from their waters back then.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight different countries and are working together and work together. they swap for information and move each other while it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of Pew Charitable State Ending illegal fishing. this project gives FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition, is hidden that is hidden because it is extremely difficult to collect. thus, the illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to deliberate disregard of existing laws, which should be protected by certain habitats and species, the illegal fishing ecosystem harm that have a delicate balances.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, while actions against illegal fishing have been hindered by bureaucratic hurdles, and with the information between different countries, the actions are today in real time with traceability to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries can exchange for example lists existing licences, news about suspicious activity or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspections.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, when they move at the open sea, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas. even so suspects that a ship can suggest that a ship floats its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the ideal case, such investigations may show whether the participating ships have a fisheries policy where they were traveling and possibly even if they have a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are opposed to illegal fishing can refuse to accept such ships in their harbours. what means that the ships cannot sell their charge. and that they can even be forced to pay punishments, as in the case of Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there is considerable financial losses for the owners, which means that the illegal fishing catch is financially worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Chief Executive Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is an adviser company which sets up for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to return an estimated $20 million in lost sales, which lose the eight members of the SISH-i network each year because of the illegal fishers who enter Eastern African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies that attracts the region commercial fishing from all over the world. among them is even the same illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">These practices are among other things as the Sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specifying fantasers, fishes protected species and fish in protected areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they benefit from lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weakness of a non-organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "a ship was illegal and a country could say" "" "You should not walk my harbour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me." "" "and exactly this legale loophole tries to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks, distributing fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships which used multiple fraudulent identities and it has been traced and found fledged ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"" "" "" "due to its cooperation with Interpol, international authority to fight crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances." ""</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the" "" "organised crime" "", "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system which should help FISH-i to produce suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>

<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which will always be developed, also helps to hide the illegal ships.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "the illegal fishers use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO which is also dealing with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships switch on for example their automatic identification systems, which they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps to build a system that connects different information levels. it should help FISH-i to find criminal agrocking ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">Yet FISH-i's team of African countries can actually influence the no doubt global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Maritime conservation organisation Oceana: a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of the position of each traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "to collect a better picture with the neighbors to get a better image of what is doing," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at global level." "" "Pew charitable trusts have to run a similar project when a global system allows the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities cannot only sense criminal, but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that were fished without license and hardly had consequences, know they're watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to gilu, some of the countries involved in FISH countries have a 33% increase in fisheries, ever since fishing boats have more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">When FISH-i entered Somalia, Greko 1 found out, the inspectors found there on board tow-nets, whose use is forbidden.</seg>

<seg id="148">"" "in 2015, six countries joined together, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are now fighting the illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "" "with certainty, even more such initiatives and structures are to be created in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia was able to report his first major triumph: in October, it was Greko 1, a ship that was travelling under false flag. and not only was the ship used without a license and were finally banned webs.</seg>

<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to join the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">Now adult husband said Quijano as part of the Great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial concluded on 24 August 2016, crimes allegedly committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden, same name as his father to carry up to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">He kept the family secret for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I thought that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a salary.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, you do not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not know that my father was a thief, a thief and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmerieriser. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state of State was his father from 1976 to 1978, Deputy Commander of the Secret Service division 141 in the prison La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who had experienced the extent of atrocities which he had experienced as a boy, and who told a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows that great power has a parent over his child, and how this child chose a path of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the gym to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I was friends with a boy, who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">They all called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it.</seg>

<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. for so my father had moved me.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>

<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, television, fridges - just everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">All this was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little slice of the parcel, and told me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great clump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen items were shut down and entertained me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open room and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured there.</seg>
<seg id="238">I saw it, and saw a song that became tortured on humans.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a bath-bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found that it fastened to the end of a cable. the other end was fastened to the body of the person who was just captivated there.</seg>

<seg id="265">When they survived the torture, the prisoners were cast into the cuaday, until the arrangement of the top came that they should be laid.</seg>

<seg id="277">I was an officer at Gendarmerie and I would never have liked to enter into a house and steal everything therein.</seg>

<seg id="280">You are not criminals?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded in rage, beat me and shouted:</seg>

<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he brought clothing back home.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time, the defence accused me to have been doing a fellow in this crime. I answered no problem, they can put my burden to me what they wanted.</seg>

<seg id="303">The disappearance of the bodies is the last shy act, which one can do to a man.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To commit, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the starting text and to transfer active language skills to get him in the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something which is in the case of motherlanguage. in general, the belief that translators should be - not in the language language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">A French native language should translate for example from English to French - not from the French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a native language which might be translated into English. this may be due to lack of understanding, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers that can learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who don't have a foreign employees, have translations to peer themselves. then the Japanese staff, whose English skills are being applied as the best, no matter how good or bad the language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrying and enigmatic sentences which are produced by machine translations will show that this technology can still lack a human translators. this applies especially to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English wording in Japan, among them also the avocative reprints which are often called t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr-users of Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors do not seem acceptable or at least harmless. but of big companies or by the government who have the means to ensure greater standards can be expected more carefully.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto uses a serious source of translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users found that they wouldn't have access to the online channel Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Other users later wrote that the websites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV have no longer available.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasts also overcontributed the protests of the protests in Caracas, who were organized by oppositionist groups who oppose the NicolÃ¡s Maduros government.</seg>

<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author of Global Voices, published the results of a Traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was bound, and recommended the users, VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinintro confirmed that not only Vivoplay is not accessible through a blocking of the domain name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transmits sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Former research of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had yielded that the local Internet providers may use DNS. this is a technology that uses certain domains of certain domains.</seg>

<seg id="407">We confirm DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked channel, the transfer was closed on Thursday, April 6th, when the VPITV camera team Elvis Flores, who had recorded live in Caracas, was taken into custody.</seg>

<seg id="410">Eight hours later, he was released, and VPITV went on stream.</seg>

<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a big family with little money handed over her underage son or her underage daughter to another, abundant family. in exchange, the child gets food, training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">But what is not mentioned, however, is that the children cannot afford countless days of housework that can never be paid and victim of abuse and abuse - and all this in the context of a contract that cannot be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas -- above all young girls who are affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected testimonials, researched and pitiated.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, for the feeling of gratitude which cries the crimitas, keep silent in general.</seg>

<seg id="462">She rose up at five in the morning and prepared the breakfast for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays for example, cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished furniture and the infected ground.</seg>

<seg id="528">"" "how Raza shows in the video," "" "is the Persian leopard the only remaining robbery in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and the degeneration of the ecosystem depends on that a big predatory is present." ""</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made for the north of Japan, had been achieved to rebuild the life of those who had been affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. an enormous earthquake, tsunami and one atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shenno newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which was in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a wealthy prefectures in Japan, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring Floweries Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, since the tsunami had lost whole coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In this way, Fukushima happened at a nuclear accident which alone had to leave their houses 160 000 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Shimpo shows the progress made by six years later, to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The comprehensive report of the newspaper includes both the Japanese Reprovement Authority as well as the survey results of those concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The accommodation facility in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts (in the ground, saigai kouei juutaku) was delivered in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">With the biggest success under the three prefectures Miyagi was able, where 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were finished.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has finished 75 percent of such houses whereas Fukushima forms the final light to Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="554">Even six years after the disaster, however, we endeavoured to evacuate six years after the catastrophe, evacuated from perry shelters (in the one, Causesu juutaku) to settle into definitive buffets.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw forced to live in perry shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people still lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated out of Fukushima still live in emergencies, whereas Miyagi was successful. more than 75 per cent of the evacuated ones that were haughed after the disaster in besieged places were resettled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the figure is 34 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected fectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by the misfortune, have opened its doors until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later the industrial reconstruction is much more difficult in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, Fukushima opened its operation only 30 percent of the fishing ports.</seg>
<seg id="563">Tsunami and atomic accident involving the three prefectures of agricultural land have grown large areas.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of his farm produce, with only 66 percent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">"" "it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the atomic fact that only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed grounds of Fukushima, are currently in the" "" "nuclear" "" "zone" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures tourism has largely recovered, but here Fukushima still remains undefeated.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist tax in Miyagi and Iwate are back up to 90 percent on the same stand as before the disaster. Fukushima, however, can only exhibit here only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the disaster has almost half the coast-inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native people prepared for the next great earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to establish a whole picture, the paper led a number of questionings among the native population and under the evacuation. they asked them about the status of reconstruction and also how their emptsunami resulted in the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In their introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami awareness among the local population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures taken to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents say that still not enough for catastrophes prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands about those who had been evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the occasion of the anniversary of earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also strengthened its attention to the location of evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience only the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima happened also witnessed the worst, catastrophic accident that Japan had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuated out of Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were transferred outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, some more than 23 000 people were moved back to Fukushima, and permanent substitute houses have been resettled.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017, still 40 000 inhabitants live in Fukushima off the prefecture of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophic regions most of the evacuated areas are known in hausen, older than 50 years old. you must find in proper accommodation, because the efforts to build Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima will compete with massive construction projects, which will be part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="627">The People's Community Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - well, regardless of that there is no significant sugar-harvest on-site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane mill were lame.</seg>
<seg id="629">After obtaining the sugar cane industry in the region silently, and the factory lost and after its installations, until only the framework of steel and concrete was left.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changes the job.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others sign and commute each day to the factories that still warns.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier-vase that stands up at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not bolted its sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are in operation in the east of the region sugar cane mill, which are in operation after a long inactive time because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene is reminiscent of having heard that in MaÃ±alich would get the sugar cane mill, but that promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the 1910 produced quantity.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for the land some decades ago, but the bad harvests have no more news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why has the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old rail path of the church saw already better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: 155 sugar cane plants were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive they became unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production reduction was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">It only allowed the factories that produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for the unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs, which led to such measures, were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price increased from approximately a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">"" "between 2017 and 2025, the price of unrefined sugar between 15 and 16 Centavos must remain, according to the 2016" "" "Agricultural Centres" "" "by the OECD and FAO, the Agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations." ""</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the 2001 level (3.6 million tonnes), the gross sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go down in history," "" "these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro in the sugar factory in Lavandero during his speech on 21 October 2002." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years the still laying of 98 sugar cane factories came, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for continuing education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane of Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on 14. may 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene appears as a soldier, is known about the closure of the factory, the word he is most repeatedly, "fraud."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">To get the place, they formed a fulltime -working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">The first letters began to arrive before the first next year.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially recognised documents that would only be removed in case of the parts, which would be removed, addressing the address, and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">They were all signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was over and the letters came more and more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was in charge of the factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that was still in operation.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 year old, is waiting for retirement in another facility, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved with his will at the feeding of the factory, whose construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part which he removed, he showed one of his 31 years of work.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial sectors of Cuba and most important workplace producers has been extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives for working conditions and services generated by the municipalities in which they found themselves.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from First Nations Communities in all of Canada deal with topics that are important for them. they do so with Hip-Hop, thanks to a number of traveling workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour since 2014, workshop manager mobile sound studios directly lead to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec in ten Cree Communities and then with the Cree Hip Hop Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">"" "the workshop thus increases the young participants in conversations like" "" "cultural identity, speech, conflict, love, self-acceptable" "" "or whatever the meaning of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">As the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize a similar workshop with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the area of the tribe of Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, said the history of Highway 16, also called' Highway of tears, "a street section in Westkanada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video game to mediate how important the receipt of traditional Sitten and Practices despite the influence through globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters did not always rule the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation is recorded, the chorus will be sung in Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The youngsters involved here received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northage Hip Hop Group who gave them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the facebookpage of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcription, also a translation into English which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel, I wouldn't ever be interested in myself</seg>
<seg id="706">But I'm trying to go on earth my days</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will get our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will be levy one day.</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and also lead our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">Thus, they can do that for what she has given the Creator</seg>

<seg id="722">The Kappabashi neighborhood is a variety of these small companies that can just produce plastic dishes, documented by German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they do not ask them once more. a new trend is now transformed into showy cell accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">With Naver Matters the blogger itinii series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanu.</seg>

<seg id="737">"" "is there someone who would say:" "" "Wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>

<seg id="779">I have been aware of illness and sensational journalism now for several years.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass daily newspaper heaps every day and see the cover pages with images which can only come from a textbook for criminology or files from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is interested or sad. it seems like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to the body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or considered to be normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10 year-old Cousin also thinks that he is big (German: drug traffickers) if he is great. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic" of the perpetrators, if they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is, as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who are afraid of them too.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness, when stories are to be exposed in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the insomnia of the human being is incredible for me when death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring place justify that they were" "" "inflated." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to spare the tragedies that they are spared away from such tragedies when they don't stir and quietly.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months blackmail in the Capital district: like a family with threats made from her business," she describes how armed criminals suffered money from her business until the end of the year not only the business was destroyed, but also their family torn apart.</seg>

<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the post "Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: one of Violence drawn Generation."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the Introduction he casts questions on how: who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he told that he had to teach himself how to make a egg, cooked potatoes, eats, tortillas and "chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the vial with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He talks about the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unutterable for a boy who has to learn all the lives of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years earlier, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody body of his father saw that by armed men of a passing car had been shot.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, as a violence caused by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of murders according to the Federal Council for Public Safety and Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor had 3103 killings. this corresponds to average 8,5 Morper per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only some of thousands of thousands of stories that leaves the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories still live in view of the new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" in 2015, Animal PolÃ­tico formed the data journalism project Narco, whose aim is to depict the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, who has tortured the country in the last four decades, in a simple manner.</seg>

<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite photos the following was depicted.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt to win the Boko Haram (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo as proof for the fact and possible magnitude of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris for two days.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (frames) that cover these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in terms of larger discussions on the silence of the killing of Christians through Muslims or - to the defence of Muslims - the killing of Rohingyas through Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second frame is used to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion, and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth considering how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer give faith to these pictures.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are zig people who have been looking for a proportion to trise water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Sugevaluates this mood of mis- and faltering, that actual atrocities are untrue and lubricate the real horror of what is actually done in the DR Congo, in Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of massive images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withhold pictures of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even requested by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that forcible pictures readers and spectators deselect and feel the ability to empathy empathy (such as this study, the investigation, such as violent media influence others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is something regarding forcible representations in the news media, the fact is that it is essential for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologist also experiment with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News." they will thoroughly rethink about the situation where a picture is somewhat sugary, which actually can be used from the context or on completely misuse.</seg>
<seg id="940">Every investigation into false mentions, however, should also be considered internationally as internationally.</seg>

<seg id="1135">Stories, by Flickr-users of Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to get in touch with someone else, despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, the founder of Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the story of stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices recently reported about a different initiative by Steven Bird, the Indispensable Blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain and strangle the language variety of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in an urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin, Australia or in Oakland, where TLS has already performed events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite as little languages were not given to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project apply:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"" "" "" "the mass mortality of the world can be avoided if we manage to take cities - safe spaces in which inhabitants must not forget who they are to belong in." ""</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listen often so often" "" "to understand these events" "" "instead," "" "listening to feel, to feel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storyteller tells their story in their own language and translate them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even though the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and their representation will allow the listeners to be inhaled.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They make up laughing and emotions as the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows such a traditional history from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou competes also the opportunity to explain the customs of tales for their land.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the beak from the bunnies and the Pavian in the language of Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after he explains the meaning of his parable, John Nyamusara is asked:" "" "how is it to speak to an audience that will not understand your language?" "" "with a wide smile he shares his feeling of inclusion:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">Until now, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling in three cities have taken place and the organizers hope to expand this. all that are inspired by the project can get in touch with TLS in order to organize their own storytellers.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a New Test for the public debts of Puerto Rico, who took part in a mass demonstration on April 3, 2017, several religious and bourgeois organisations participated in a mass rally; the march of the capital, which went to the Plaza de ColÃ³n, in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">"" "it was proclaimed by the group" "" "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda" "" "(for the neural examination of the debts) and the Eastern Church Assembly of Puerto Rico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1157">"" "" "" "the advocates of the restructuring of the debt also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Rico claimed that politicians, benker and government agencies that are responsible for their debts to their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We call for financial examination and an Steering Committee without personal interests in public debts, with a firm, our working conditions appropriate remuneration that is in favor of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We will be pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Rico refuses to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>

<seg id="1165">We demand immediate measures.</seg>

<seg id="1167">Hence the so-called "Center for New Economy," a government independent non-profit organization with no focus on socioeconomic development, a law to state responsibility, as an alternative to existing public sight.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>

<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives arrested the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">This year's re: publica, annual conference on the digital culture annual meeting held in Berlin, devoted to the event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the France-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, Managing Director of the Book Prize of Freedom: a Collective Ind (The Cost of Freedom: a collective dependence).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year, has been released and posted here, includes a number of essays that deal with free culture in face of suppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is an homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is called:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built, and what the true costs are linked to whom this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artist, designer, developers, researcher and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge, have been working on page to get over the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create something out of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free the Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers, who has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was repainted from the directory of the Adra prison in which he sat on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for its participation in a free culture, many of us start thinking about their own destiny, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why Are We Here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up extreme beliefs in this process?</seg>
<seg id="1200">Since March 2012, the web developer for open source and digital activist has been in custody by Syrian government authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military facility to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel had taken on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, who had informed himself as an insider of the Assad administration and informed them about a alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His residence and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a decisive role to extend the Internet and to knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologian, and currently overlap the head of New Palmyra, a project called Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps no one of Bassels cultural prototypes was acting as the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archeological sites in the world, was the cross of many civilizations and here are Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel wasn't able to know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would set everything that embodies the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This move into digital archaeology and the conservation has created a time cartridge, which will be the public for public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not complete this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my entire life with it, dreaming of freedom, and bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">He taught me English, even when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked him. he has taught others to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened my door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners, as they use computers, at least theoretical, without having actually held one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (waiting), a trial application that she was in prison from 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She cast the lyrics with him, when she visited him, and he translated them from the Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1228">It happens with every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I fail in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the reflection on the moment in which we embrace ourselves,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That any danger does not matter to me,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, fetters and guard</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the prisings of the prison</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mosambique: Director of corruption in case of corruption reinstated on previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambique responded to anger on a corruption incident in which a government member returned to the work in the state machine after half of his sentence after half of his sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is a deodino Cambaza, which was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants (about 800 000 â¬) to 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from the public funds of the airports of Mozambique whose Council appointed Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for a good lead and immediately ordered his resultation to the company, which was then on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a general opinion of the Attorney General of the Republic, there would be no hazard background for Cambaza, to again refer to his old item, as the company had no discipline after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many citizens do not need this action.</seg>
<seg id="1261">"" "the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution which advocates itself for public transparency, in an interview with Deutsche Welle, the decision of the company to stop the director again:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "poses a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the absence of transparency and is even a regression regarding the efforts of our legal system, thus the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">"" "" "" "what we have to inform about that also the company should have instituted a disciplinary approach against the contradicting workers." ""</seg>
<seg id="1264">The firm, however, seems to ensure reasonable legal measures for the application of appropriate functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a major voice in the Muslim social media, rejects this behaviour also and considered the case as "contradictory":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to one prison term and half of them had to eat.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speech, he could advise and repose his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has decided to become integrated into the company, which he helped to cause harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza would love to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resistible!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says, the director does not have any moral authority:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza by the State rewards, because he bellied to it, I can't believe that someone is rewarded someone in such a way that has already massively insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks morals to serve and serve the State, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has only served by the State instead.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as he had been getting tired of an inexhaustible money source and the state itself is weary that was summoned and finally condemned to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this guy was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte prefers to remind the prime minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief belongs to the prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Zamora Machel will not only remain in memory for ever as an independent president but also as a sharp, one cutting and - by the way - prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">"" "one of his most famous illustrations was when he affirmed that" "" "an ambitious man was capable of all his own individual interest to sell his own individual interest." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1279">"" "then Samora said," "" "I don't know if an ambitious person is changing, my experience shows that it is not so." "" "he changes the tactics, but he does not address his ambitions." ""</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious human being is a criminal one. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also rejected:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Sentenced to 22 years in prison, Cambaza was in prison for 10 years and was released.</seg>

<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pe" means chickpeas or spider.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photos of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to information from Facebook users in Myanmar, the popular social network accepted its postal mail from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is normally used to refer to people East Indian source or generally used as an adjective. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook compiles the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "Kalar" "" "(in burmesic writing) as part of an initiative in order to address the popular problem of speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely high-value connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that most often used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in his efforts to fight rabbits in Myanmar, the company has compensated a lot of meaningful content on his platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar can normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call acceptance speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important, # 8212; many people have reported that even postings in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about his use for use, censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover, there are several burial words with basic meanings that have the same letter as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, stool is written on Burmically 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (Spider), 'Kalar Oat' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (Curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboogner Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">One post of my friends was erased today, because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends in a spiritual way if they were wanting as he could alleviate his spinal pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The set ku la - "cure" (ku) + the Questionnaire (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is the opinion that it will be reduced by radical nationalists, but it also stressed that Facebook to be analytic to spread all Posts that are suspected to spread racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automation will not understand what you are writing on Facbeire.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is carefully read the post and check it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pe" (switch balls).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these triangular nationalists, who spread hasslanguage, get a rather good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"" "" "" "as the action may send a strong signal to all of them, the efficiency of this strategy is no longer attainable." ""</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proved that the censorship will often start to use a cat and mouse game, whereby the users can simply start social networks to use a new word or alternative spelling of the scanned word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his post as he wanted to share his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banished by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new policy from Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post from Facebook was removed and told me that the liken, post and parts of content was prohibited for 24 hours because the post "on the Facebook community standards did not decide."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of postcards from people who don't have negative intentions or trying to show their opinions about the assessing radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate language:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Postal mail is removed from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the mail the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are poorly.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes Facebook should have been doing more at the beginning of the initiative, for example asking the Burmese Internet community to ask advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook has a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but it doesn't work like that.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words can only be used more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if it all started without local context or technical support and forbidden as words as "chair" or "peas curry".</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found that they made mistakes, they did not try to purify the falsified Posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"" "" "" "if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits, which would have a great turnover, that would be great." ""</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has taken care of a lot under the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Rather than take it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hasslanguage to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots from Facebook postings which were not cluded but nevertheless removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and look at pediccurry and watch a Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "just to try out if Facebook contains the mail, which contains the word Kalar." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists, social networks have used to enhance their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, Hassau is to continue to heat the violence in Myanmar in Myanmar, especially in the area Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have been forced to escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticized for his failure to criticise the balancing hassle on its Burmese pages under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of just putting the word 'Kalar', it would have looked better to have looked at the context as on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1347">Statistics from the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children who had already been married to 15 percent in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and with 18 they were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011 the country's Statistical Office of the country confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media motions, which were endeavoured to abolish laws on pediatriots, followed by great support. without doubt, they helped to bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu guide, for example, had no concerns that they should say the criticism 'criticism, they should be damned to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition headed for tensions in this actually uncomplicated thing, and sometime, doubts came about whether the opposition of the law would agree.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But the bill was decided at the beginning of 2017 - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent that contained in the House of Representatives, where he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must approve and declare the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update to Facebook, which was posted to the Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill bill against the children's area was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 votes, and none of them was decided.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Once he has been decided in the Senate, the draft may now become a statute.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media-users were thrilled, because the laws of the children's area were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Lovell Francis, a host office of the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">"" "" "" "it has taken a lot of time and unnecessary talk that is veiled to the core of the cause, but you know what? the children in Trinidad and Tobago now are illegal and this is worth every prize." ""</seg>

<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group that was quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was noted:</seg>

<seg id="1367">The amendment to the amendment of the Act was approved today, on June 9, 2017.</seg>

<seg id="1375">But a possible hook is found in the form of Sat Maharaj, according to the secretary general of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu-organization in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj had announced his intention to undertake the judicial steps, should the law be approved, and he seems to fully redeem his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the General Attorney General Paris Al rawi, a supporter of the law, said it is quite right if Maharaj wishes against the law, would like most social media users, you would argue the debate on this subject differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we don't say instead of speaking, in a way that could cause only panic and evil, instead of speaking to the problem, that the state, our daughters, that they might be compared to them, would be misused, "would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think it's not about a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a judicial approach to the law, or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the children in different gradations are legal or still the norm, though there are laws that they say.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English version of Wikipedia left on 18 January 2012, opposed to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally obscured.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than one month, Turkey closed the popular and on the crowd sourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Tag on day is more clearly, how important the user is for users to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students as well as reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques used to use blocked web users (a new article from the New York Times suggests that Turkey has the third-largest VPN prevalence of the world), most common Wikipedia users don't fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been closed from Wikipedia as recently as recently as a report by the Berkman Small Center for Internet & amp; Society on Harvard University has been submitted to find regular blockings on the Internet since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most known country in the world, when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform is still locked, several mirrors are displayed (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform has removed all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralised Peer-to-Peer network which is not supported on the system of domain names and makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is not callable despite legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia) we sat on it all about reading snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the content in a centralized, distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view all the Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was performed independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it only concerns screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to handle the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has a mirror site of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open-source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors respect if it is blocked in the country of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member and collaborator at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is no complete copy of a proxy address, a Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One accesses another URL that is not the original, that what you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server will forward the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos he saw around himself was never satisfied. they were blurred with badly positioned motives and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">It motivates him to carry a camera on yourself and try to graze the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring himself into the international stage in Nepal.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his homeland right beside the Chitwan National Park, it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures that direct attention to Nepals wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Described on Facebook, he described this first-class situation in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live on the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate game photographers!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navarre (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father, that on the bank of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The River dam is just a few minutes from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the space on the other side of the river, where the leopard was and I immediately started to crack pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar attaches a collaboration with the authorities to acquire global recognition for Nepals Nature and wants to deepen understanding that wild animals are not so terrifying as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he was already on face to face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't be disrupted from the opinion of the sheep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">I too was at home because of the dark on the way home when suddenly the king of Buheks appeared. he immediately begins to see us and he stares through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and usually lived in a tent in order to take pictures from Otters. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds, which live near the tourist attractions.</seg>

<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, there are women with great care, the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a tonomic or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women may respect that they respect the husband's social pressure, and fear of the consequences they ought to respect the norm.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of an Indian state of Odisha by a pseudocourt and violate their family and the village community after she had spoken a native relatives with his name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives also not by name, is also common among men. however, they have far fewer allowances to fear, if any one, they should not come after this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them Health dontics and housewives, a unique club and were thus quickly became the main topic of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place just for them alone where they discuss and discuss the hostility of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"" "" "" "as one of 56 clubs that exists in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is run by the Community Video Volunteers and is engaged in the exploitation of the Patriarchate." ""</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas working for seven years with the help of her video camera in the field of practices, such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and guides these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports, as these clubs have created a safe place for these women and they simultaneously made them to ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video showing the Rohini in its discussion round, was the best selling of women who did not call their husbands on behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which the women could easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The names of their husbands did not speak loudly, a custom, to maintain and never be questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">The Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition shows that a woman is respected by her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not keep this is regarded as deceitty, as woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never had thoughts about this discussion round about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning Rohini, who had never had called her husband, had never wanted to try his name at home, as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round of her husband and mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini talks about:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother in law and my husband still weigh long after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said," "" "I should call him from now on his name." ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage Rohini began their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to put the discussion with practice.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked any participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked them all," "" "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, that they cannot respect us?" "" "" ""</seg>

""</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini talks about:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy, that she could only be afraid during the whole practice; one another decided to release the whole gestion of frustration against him and his family, causing it to curse him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the adrenaline, to have broken with an old custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands upon name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a multitude of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in his head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother in law came her, she was afraid, and told that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini meant I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A group of participants was less understandable and the situation parted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported how women tried to stop other practices, such as carrying the galvanic score on the forehead, showing the spouse:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinced red point if he did.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed at only, and I stopped doing that to bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"" "" "" "the other women have not completely stopped with it, but they, they are now in a better position to choose him, not to bear him on some days." ""</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we are doing an excursion at each discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I do not want women to worry about who could hear what" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months she celebrated her own birthdays with cakes for the first time; they danced and talking about things about which they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have been doing about some things, for example how our identities are knotted to our husbands, never as honestly spoken.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say things loudly, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honour and how it is associated with clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group had only taken saris in their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them that is okay, but some wanted a Salad-Kurta, a wide trod over a pants, wear; they have not dared.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of argument and discussion on the advantages of their own closets, morals linked to the Saris and much more, glassworks Rohini their own couple of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion round, so that women could wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa in which they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure that they will succeed.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini affirmed that things come into rolls slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have made only little steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tasted it a few times, but then listened to the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some people are confined to make it, but only when they are alone and not other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two say the name of their husbands; only one or two women are now wearing Zinnoberred at their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in a discussion lub know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the fever on more freedom of movement or their own closets - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How to explain Rohini:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is victims of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But with this club, each of us gives confidence that something is going to change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if every woman is home in the club and other people about it, what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison because of "Subversion" (the state of state after the Draft), a manifesto which calls for democratic reforms in China.</seg>

<seg id="1642">The diplomatic relations continued only in December last year, Norway signed an agreement to escalate the salmon after China, because the exports had been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the message has been spreading that Liu was seriously ill and brought the Nobel Peace to express his hope for an unconditional release and invited Liu to pick his price in Oslo.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem dumb, as it is recognized at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But, according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting occasion of the meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association, the Minister found that many people criticised the domination of the only political party in Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody asked whether New York be a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, with most people going a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a town.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog of Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "to turn logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercices of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and offered sacrifices to create this valuable land, we hear that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight before the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you're not my country, whose country is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons performed by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in the face of that, he appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These towns are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core point of the subject, the good old surrounds of the authoritarian makers appears to be the predominant logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">At the end of the final week of Shanmugam we were given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our advertisative, our political system really non-responses.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Associated questions he acted with non-responses rational type.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng urges Shanmugam to illustrate his mind since she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I think it's a bit hard to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city, in which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our value K Shanmugam would take on the trouble to clarify this point as he was paid very much to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By releasing his comment on the blog, he points out regarding the critics that you should begin to understand the complete transcript of the conference so to understand the context of the sayings of Shanmugam better, according to which Singapore was a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the address.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "as he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "country" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore are so uneven if we delight in free and just choices." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the U.S. (and how many of these towns looked for a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "be no country," "" "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment via Shanmugam, the leader of a growing generation that makes such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore told, very...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde which I expected - be with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I doubts and I'm not sure if he really believe that he really believes and is aware of what he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review concludes the weak points of Shanmugams Arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Does Mr Shanmugam "committed a mistake" or was it a wudder spokesman?</seg>
<seg id="1720">When Singapore is not a country, we are only regarded as independent and sovereign State?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country go the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally both land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the government's cabinet, the sayings of Mr. Shanmugam are of grave significance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the Singaporeans do their military service, do they defend only their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our Prime Minister's bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink people?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">If the magazine Journey of a Decade tends to the affirmation of Singapore and it was always a town:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence shines many Singaporeans to have annoyed...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear statements like" "" "the defence of the country especially" "" "etc, but that's not quite right." ""</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coralline pink bread and gold earrings in teddy bear.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a target for Africans and Haitians who are on the transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>

<seg id="1974">While notifications with digital censorship in China mainly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often glostered for those who live in remote, pressed ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>

<seg id="2060">I have used it to me, not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can really tell you exactly when insults and punches have become a friendly conversation for me to become an ordinary communication tool.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how that happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice in me told that I had to get used to get used to it, though I had done nothing to earn this punishment.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Of punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to pluck me as much flesh as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls it lovingly "confession".</seg>

<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you cannot withhold your cries.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My cries did not play enough for him, so that the pipe caused the pipe through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">At my first arrest, I asked myself whether the investigator had worked as a garbage collector, or whether it belonged to normal working equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had flown four cables to present us up, from their point of view, to present great invention of a giant cabal.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within one hour three of them changed, while I was still in the row.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I listened to screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The executioner noticed the cooling and found no appeal to it, which is why it took a neighbour to an electrically loaded rod.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity flowed through my entire body, enough to supply my entire district.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My semi-cracker body, which lay stretched on the ground, was the perfect conductor.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBT + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a smoke in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends the majority of his time inside; sometimes he locks on his canvas, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">What you can rely is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine defiled lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the supreme execution of his family house which had belonged to them since 1967; the year, in which Israel had forced his occupation of the Westbank and fled from their village in Palestine where they lived as felahyeen (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For more than six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist, which the conservative majority opposeth for gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and raping.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which deals often with themes such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of the Arab world. all these topics do not only find in his home town Amman relevance, but also in cities that from Damascus in Syria up to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his thinking, and he can feel with people who are under the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not open it openly, he calls for a special envious against the American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib visits his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who have attempted to do in war zones, do anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian legislative of the second generation," even if he was born in Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think because of my own living conditions," said Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think I'm a man, while he's dissolved in water in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan. in this time it is provided for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also says that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness of breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the swig do the warm coffee and the waver of the Kent-Cigarette in the nose into the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when taking a look into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to avoid basic things - as in public during the Ramadan water - to avoid not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior of the Interior adopted a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary groups that support the Islamic Republic of Action - arguing that sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsman Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional norms of the country, contradict the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert tables.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the deputies and former press spokeswoman in the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "just" "" "had been cancelled due to sexual orientation of the prison." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim that involvement of the band in affairs as the Arab Spring, human rights and free speech expression in the Arab world may be more dangerous than authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila called the jordan people as "progressive supporters of human rights," which continues to use for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement may not be simply being the rhetoric of the rhetoric, an increasingly crystal clear reality reflected in Jordan, which seems to be clear in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib learned traditional gender norms to body by preventing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex-helichen sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a clearly down rampaged unknown woman whose arms and legs are extended up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who they actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past years, the number of 'honourable' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch predicts its culmination in 2016. however, the number of honourable infrastructure is still lacking that Jordan has become the institutional infrastructure, in order to aid women, victims of attempted murder, or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law governing failure in 1954, women who are exposed to danger of internal-family violence, "and for their release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee from the family that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs Music also enjoys great popularity and is well known to frighten some topics in his country as taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib striving that his work is political, however, dreamt that he is his music that is full of explicit beliefs on sexuality, freedom and expression of expression, not part of politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was proverted in politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa 'ed, Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and" "" "Ghareeb" "" "is the focus again on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs, which are in essence, can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"" "in the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get what you want" "" "- be faith or disbelief, Hetero- or homosexuality." ""</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of coils and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBT individuals will be sharply censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular jordan Onlineprogram Roya, in order to memorize his comments from the context, twisted and his mind were censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, without any incisions, it was uploaded without any incisions, but only a worked version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib buys openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance is not discouraged by homosexuals.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nudas, a poet of the eighth century, still has remained remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Huram, who should work once again on behalf of the Caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why is Jordanians not that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, has nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila, or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service concluded several former government officers and members of the teacher, with the grounds that they had criticized in social media critical problems dealing with the deeply rooted in the land.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the concert Hdaibs's opinion is according to the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural changes in the next generation of Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a standalone and take. Jordan has now denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - this is what Hdaib exists. it is sure that this changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he dreaming not only to bring his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is grasped by using music, art and literature in a real and basic openness - and not through bombs, streamed positions and on artificial nature. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until that time, Hdaib is going to rap and thus also resist resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">This great, extravagant war dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is assumed that it is celebrated as a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually haunted in August in many areas of Tohokus and from time to time, in the army invaded the region of Japan, to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi to force the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could grab a few great places, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can imagine just how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A common centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen organized a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (littl).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I've been looking for a long time on the Meguro Gajoen: two pushchairs have just been seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true and a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The view of a 18 meter high tower was incredible.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth from crime, and to promote a legitimate vocation like those of the HairForwarder.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific ocean, close to the historical center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street smoked and illegal drug trafficking are daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region don't feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other intermediate and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous sports athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to more norm in the experienced hands of hairdresser, which can make these lavish hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">An unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired a annual event, the competition of hairdresser "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There will be experts each other to show who can create the most eccentric rows, as you can see in the following video (other videos on current competitions is available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, which is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to obtain their weapons against hairdressing tools, which enables them to find work in the hairstyling.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the evolving opportunities, dozens of young people saw that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year, the school offered special training workshops and reported to some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district, where we are very proud, for we have built this educational community for children.</seg>

<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of "lovers of love messages" which published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to men who know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important, people who feel outcast, affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was precisely the question of the two young Colombian activists from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired her to write letters to the campaign cartas por la RETARaciÃ³n (letters for reconciliation).</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the venue of an historical event, and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian Government concluded a peace agreement with the GuerillaMovement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces), which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was the sign of the peace agreement as such a significant event that Colombian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, before columbianists, however, there is a long way until one can speak of a true reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "" "" "Guerrilla's struggles who have lived in illegal camps for many years, and around the clock had to carry out their weapons in their arms, and have to integrate into life as civilians." ""</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society in turn, who used to accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred, has to take action in their ranks and support it in the building of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Columbians would close together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly this they did, as far as thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former Guerilla forces to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla war - who shall be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for Reconciliation was developed on the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize that took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">"" "" "" "this stated that we love the people who love to write thousands of love letters, but those who need them much more needful." ""</seg>
<seg id="2197">He is planning to share his love with people this year, with the most urgent need.</seg>
<seg id="2198">"" "so the plan to write letters of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC who now have to build their place in society and establish a new life." "" "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make a discourse of a history of peace," "" "they say." ""</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i had never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on March 19th in one of the UN camps in the Caldono Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the City Cooperation of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation BogotArt rearrange the camps to personalize the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set themselves on how they used to meet the leaders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of sheltered persons from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">"" "it was a very moving moment for all those involved." "" "it is incredible how many different feelings in just a few hours go through - from fear to happiness and everything that is between," "" "said the political science student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later." ""</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former militant led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">"" "when I saw in one of the" "" "Cambuches" "" "(a kind of cottage, in which the guerrilla battle live) I saw an errilla battle that wrote something." ""</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down because beside him on the bed was a MGL-pomegrower, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty sleep.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "and I spoke to him anyway," "" "Hello, what do they just do?" "" "he answered," "" "I am answering a letter which someone wrote me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life was someone written to me something so beautiful, so I answer it." "" "my tears suddenly ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely, and sat down beside the Grenade Launcher.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"" "" "" "maybe he was sorry for all the years of faithful companions to be this fighting, and wanted to help him write this letter." ""</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life as war. when the FARC had never expected, it was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the hunger strike. "I never thought that someone would have forgiven me for my mistake.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a company outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I just learned how to handle weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC leaders were already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "therefore, the leaders of the FARC declares the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" "" "for many years we have experienced the ability to develop us to a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this order, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"" "" "" "these people heard that before had never seen hearing nor had no choice, and to recognize that people who often have seen as monsters and even hate them, who were turned around by their livelihoods and their environment, was very painful for me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, in which the country lives, doesn't hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But comfort me that all men - including those who have killed and so much damage, give us a bit of a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters answer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of the town of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Columbianists were prophesied that peace would reign after the disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "as long as it gives inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to raise up and protest to their rights. and that is also completely justified (...)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">We from FARC now rely on peace, based on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore, we call all defenders of peace - regardless of which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, because we know of your own experience that nothing is simple. that among us defend the life as the basis of existence, many difficulties are imminent.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had to get started and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women were called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two worms in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which hospitals you have been placed - in which men or women have?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor drew and laid me for the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">For this I am very grateful.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office I got it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote to me - Related, stranger, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relative.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The desired to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They released absurd claims: some said to me, I must prove it by running through the roads; others wanted to appear in the official TV in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex to say that everything was only bad talking, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have bask-size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how has your family tried to handle this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once said my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "You have brought a monster to the world not only your family but the whole of the republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you, because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she put on a knit around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window a car with dark window washers and a license plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was some lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My Human Rights Friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you braided?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without sign up, without notice, without notice, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" "" "you don't believe, you're in security only because you have left the country?" ""</seg>

<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, about gender equality is not speaking, this is a taboos.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I wish that these spiritual barrier can't overcome this.</seg>

<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who had injected the one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan there was no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and family.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"" "so my I, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require a proof that the so-called" "" "glory" "" "have experienced in blood coagitation." ""</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are men still gay men in these secret prisons now?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me says, there would be not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, most of all those who have no rich relatives or which were dropped by their relatives, to prove Kadyrows judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be detained, so that they can present them later than terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim they could have attacked any village or military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply gone, they are specifically subdued to radicalize.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is it just a guess or do you have a source of this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote anyone who was imprisoned at about one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have gone up in this prison after their beard grew grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new of them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person was involved when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">However, until now they were not presented as bandits, in addition there were no reports yet. we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have been allowed to shave this man?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always brought my hair long time.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think, before 2003 I was already in the whole Grosny, when I was still alive there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when Sharia was considered, I never had problems.</seg>

<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never been crooked for me.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grosny, there was a place where every evening, mainly on weekends, a whole group of people met with me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and all the city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a phrase: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Don't say about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just have their eyes closed before you, because they believed they are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never chased and never struck.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov resigned to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he started speaking about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us by se, but primarily on women's behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who laughed and laughed at once, looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the meantime, I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the Republic has shifted steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: which activities are you going on now?</seg>

<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the US are not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>

<seg id="2389">Do you know, many think about Transidentity about males who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a deception.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of feeling to be precise, different habitats.</seg>

<seg id="2411">The region, which is a large part of the Arab-owned Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to dispute their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahraz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi-monarchy took power and in 1925 did great efforts to end the ethnic autonomy in all Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Awaz region, there are some of the largest in Iran forward oil and gas fields, as well as some of the most important and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources the regional economy continue to evolve only slowly, and the local population gets only little from this wealth.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is an revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide and originally published on the AfrofÃ©minas website. the article was an object of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression.</seg>
<seg id="2436">They can be found in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who describe themselves as an intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">You wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we generally should be all feminist * within.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women nowadays still earn less money in spite of equal education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observations, when it comes to what they can do with her body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"" "" "" "or that cultural and social standards ensure that women sooner or later encounter a glass ceiling in various fields of life, and discrimination based on the sex is still passing through the many different countries." ""</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it and I was suffering double and triple below.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I'm coming to speak on skin color, on black transiveal women, on black transigence women, to black women in the LGBTI community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention, as we have always used in raceccentric, mental and verbal jobs, many white feminists decide to keep silence intersectional feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">"" "but nevertheless, all agree that women - all women - come together to" "" "lift up their voices and sing" "" "Kumbaya, my lord" "", "to achieve equality for equality (some) women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2449">"" "" "" "but they don't want to talk about that, in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutional form of motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways." ""</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic and origin are less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls are deported to the school more often than white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migrant background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all men to do all males and all human rights. on the other hand, I cannot connect to a movement in whose center the white woman refuses to consider the injustices in their thinking, which relate to the gender as well as to the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I'm exhausted and will not fight for my membership in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that always has rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "in 1851, in her speech," "" "Am I not a woman?" "" "I also refused to maintain a ideology, in which the black woman is a fundamental and marginalized nature." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups of groupings, which assimilated by cultural expropriation our customs and customs in order to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will not try to define white women the importance of overlapping of skin color and gender. because some of them continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to give them a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism has been set up to set up women from different places and restrict itself from the white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I take it before, to join me full of feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, which was so persistent for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of me for a white-feminist paradigm, that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women in our own ideas and take us into the spheres that we are created for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson River Weems, the author of Africa's womanism: reclaiming Ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: as we can defend ourselves in this way, in which they can also defend ourselves totally and in which the cultural, spiritual, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements could be venerated that make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists instantly call separatism and exclusion, after they have read these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift up black women and women of other cultures, as in this paradigm I existed.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my being.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in a environment in which my life failed, nor ignored, nor denied.</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police Commissioner said Ada BÃ¡ez that she could not do anything against Luis Balbuena, her partner who had become violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship was passed and the police said, her testimony would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another wife Balbuena proved to be mistreated because of abuse, the accurate display of Ada BÃ¡ez was evident.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman moved her ad back.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women once again addict, they generally do not receive support from the stage.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence in all cases of prosecutions.</seg>

<seg id="2493">86% of indications when police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence in the peace of peace. 86% of women's ads came here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women said that they were physically badly used, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics show however not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayan women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only few of these offences will be shown, too. "on every woman who are reimbursed in Paraguay for psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">There are two women who do not do this for physical abuse on each woman who do not do this, "she explained in late 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since the killing of Paraguay has no own criminal law, the prosecution authorities cannot appropriately document how many women have been murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Alone up to August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's murders in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has at least 37 cases where women have been murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2506">She did not want to do that in the beginning, but after that she was supposed to regret it forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and has no longer concerted with Carlos. but for two years, she carried out psychic violence, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would once become victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I thought that only women happened to be subordinated, because they don't be fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana uses social media to report on the mistreation by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described its insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he isolated it.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their posts, including Carlos himself. he asked to rhetoric, if he ever charged the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had enjoyed this so long by Carlos and didn't break it earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It almost seemed like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain blame.</seg>

<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's ads with the authorities were without a result and also of their relatives, she received no support.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely reported or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing area addressed to one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for medical research on site: there are many medicines and vaccines to cover the specific medical requirements on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have more serious implications in the poorest countries in Africa, and lack of investments in the research of these diseases by the Pharmafirmen are a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research, which is carried out by African scientists, helps to develop their own research capacities in Africa. major role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the centralabors centre for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, when the AIDS epidemic showed its first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself worked on the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to assist the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person.</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment, the focus of my work on the application of research results. thereby I assist the samic national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I also developed a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant disease pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what are your opinion according to the important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always keep the receiver instead of being alacher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is to find suitable scientists for projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects will be funded differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or withdraw here, as financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work which you did not before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not conform to the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods in schools ought to be taught to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need of special academic education, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and efficiency of traditional medicine will greatly benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and drawbacks of life as scientists in Africa compared to Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and license access to scientific expertise, which represent challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limits the amount of available information and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental issues worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton bred already in the United States since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company has 114 types, such as Outredder, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumes by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Mortons' work has been set by its own ingenuity and the question how many salads can get there.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noted that more salads were patented and that he could not continue to rebrew them for this reason.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for single varieties, but also for certain qualities as resistance to diseases, a special rotor or green or curved leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past years more of such patents have been registered on more plants such as cereals or cardboard. based on these trends, plants and experts provide food safety to ensure the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton is still a salad he needs no longer, since its work is always worth more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's like a boulders lying in a river to which I have to dumpy." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do this now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition" "", "he says." "" "I think these patents go far to salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before court, no one can breed a new salute, because all the features are patented, so it's so good as possible and tries to breed those features that he would like.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and tries to use no material that is protected as a intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">"" "he also joined a movement which is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding (" "" "Open Source" "" "breeders)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2641">"" "the astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red RÃ¶mersalat of the" "" "greenhouse" "" "at the station. there we have been testing whether plants are grown in space." ""</seg>
<seg id="2642">Foto: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather as though the movement from the IT-area would come and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Open source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open-source" seed) can be inspired by the motion for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was initiated into life in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, and can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders could pledge to use that others can use the seed alive free of them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they can continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" -breeders only allow others to breed their seed, to cross it as own varieties, and do not immediately outcrops - two aspects, which are banned or prescribed by many plant patrons.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Sincere prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the Emeritus Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi, CEO Jack Kloppenburg are control over seed and the possibility to grow new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds are likely to play a role in larger combinations such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would attempt to use the latter, not only little using natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg stresses that the" "" "open source" "" "movement is not busy with genetically modified plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic agriculture or not. "to achieve our aim of ecological sustainability in the global agricultural industry, it should also know that in August or September 2016, we should also know that the way in which this vegetables are cultivated, is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without seed supremity is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to providing others their seed still freely available, in contrast to the seed, seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters may argue that the future of food supply is endangered because the available gene pool is due to the increasing intellectual property rights of plant material that is thus always reduced, insensitive to shrinking.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found out that approximately one-third of all the map features are protected as intellectual property, whereby it is usable for plant breeders either at all or not only arable.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are not such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby suspect that mass-grown plants are patented as wheat in more extensive style as lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Matter of Visions</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so bred that they have specific undesirable features - from such, by which their taste or their colour improves until such, because of which they prosper in certain environments, such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Adversaries of patents on plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by ever more patents. but nowadays, genetic variability be more needless than ever since the changes in climate change are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto's spokesperson in Carly Scaduto, that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four coats and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preservation of genetic variety.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, she contradicts that intellectual property fails to restrict other breeders, as" "" "patents and the protection of plant variances for innovations." "" "a patent is basically a plan to follow everyone as soon as the patent is up." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method of the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection will not inhibit innovation, but promotes the public more material and know-how to be made available." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks very different: 20 years waiting for a patent. this would certainly not result any innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long for plants, which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">"" "" "" "the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources still have been a common good and it should remain, neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us, and it will be impossible for us if we don't continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton is based on the concept of patented plant characteristics: "we don't really create the features.</seg>
<seg id="2673">They form the plants themselves and as breeders, we have no idea how the plants do it.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol deppe, plant breeding in the US-state Oregon and Ossi member board, there is another important aspect of the plant breeding: "who bred a variety, also provides its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Who believes in the industrial farming with great farms and monocultures, for which cultivating Herbizide are needed, who cultivates this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, it is the most smaller seed companies to survive - either simply refuse the patented or they do it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>

<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 05.August the Egyptian government locked up the Arabic network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt, as well as the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "in August the network released a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step, and promised to continue work and efforts for human rights in the region." ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic network for Human Rights Information, despite this attack and subjection of the Egyptian law and the Constitution, should defend itself to its goal, to continue to resolve the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, and even though it has never been so difficult to overcome these objectives and do not recreate them. we're waiting to fulfill our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked off the independent news page MADA Masr, Arab-speaking edition of the Huffington Post and the network of Qatar for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, there is no access to the blog of the columniest and human rights scientist Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog on the spread of columns and articles that he does not write to inaccessible websites and media in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now, the blog, which he built to circumvent the censist of the Egyptian government, even target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider of that also called Ziadas blog, however, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 and recorded a video, as he exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Its products are mainly about policy and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment Ziada said to the lock by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The, Blogs to Lock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It is successful for them to mediate the feeling of a siege of arrest; an arrest, an attempted murder, summons at the National Security Council, the barriers of blogs, and any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You proved that I was not writing for nothing. in other words, my words have influence, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used to handle items to handle censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, after having locked it and that they may be afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">"" "" "" "the couriers go to the end." ""</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities locked up technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), among others Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blocking of providers by integrating internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12 we noticed how the barriers of websites that VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the intention of the government to block and filter content to the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is also worsened that the censored decisions are taken behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with which they can perform against this action.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and whom will it be next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>

<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so as journalists do not close our eyes from cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, that this decision was no reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>

<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira argued to describe the violence as a "war." this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it harder, responsible for police force.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as shown by the analysis of the military rates in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, reconnaissance and a historical and self-counterlect of the public service.</seg>

<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left by his small reward, and went into Iran. once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars that were heavier than he himself to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, like today, Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation.</seg>

<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we mounted nylon before the open windows so that we don't indulge at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf had left his life without papers in Iran and made his way ready for the trip to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing over the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek Authorities had rejected his application for asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Asharaf homeless, ran away alone through the streets of Rome, slept in Parks and went to a church who shared twice a day of food in hostess.</seg>

<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a admission center if they officially expressed an application for asylum, which can withdraw after the registration of the asylum request for months.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then people who don't have money for accommodation, either rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">Thus also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his indwabated life-life helped Asharaf to free oneself out of these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After he had made various works in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf put all the savings into the creation of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">It was so good that he still opened a second hostel after a while.</seg>

<seg id="2920">Asharafs goals have, however, go far beyond the Italian food industry and the retail sector, and aim back to the country that he had to leave due to teenage children.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where a risk is, there are possibilities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my land and I cannot live happy if I know that my people suffer.</seg>
