this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the N@@ SA was illegal teleph@@ ones by Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in it he describes a cat@@ astroph@@ ic US secret service in which the CIA was literally handed down dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , please read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter doesn &apos;t like ?
the US Government .
for nearly 10 years , the government was determined against R@@ isen , and urged him to name his alleged springs .
in this train he became a symbol for the pattern of government to condemn W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and repor@@ ters .
according to the First Constitutional Court , media have the right to publish secret information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot obtain this information and if they cannot protect identity of the Mu@@ tigen , which they cost . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so when the government arrived at R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ ageous repor@@ ters did before him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He refused and told that he would rather go to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go into prison .
but then , only days before the process , something extraordinary happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , for years , it had been vital for years , that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government had dropped to R@@ isen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , repor@@ ters and sources can always hide less .
instead of failure and R@@ isen , he could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , kept secret from his telephone .
just like its e @-@ mail , financial and bank information , its credit card , and even travel policy with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ le@@ lower and cra@@ fting source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but the justice had more common than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government gets too much of their job as secret .
since 11 September , almost every article about national security was the result of that a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower ran to a repor@@ ter .
so , we put the PR working on the game , which should be protected by the first const@@ itu@@ ent , because the government has more possibilities to spy out all .
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to circum@@ vent the rights of repe@@ aters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed , they can record it from the moment in which they contact , rather than in h@@ ind@@ sight .
today , there are communication software that had not yet been written as R@@ isen had written his book , and it is much safer to call normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transmission system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet of Germany , which was developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , in which I work , developed further .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any ordinary contact form .
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server , only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can &apos;t get more information secre@@ tly , and many of the information it would ask would not be available from the out@@ set .
Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately governments are always developing new sp@@ ying technologies throughout the world to je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all over the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is to make sure that not only technology affairs as Edward Snow@@ den have a way to perform mis@@ deeds . it is just as vital that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower ,
who wants to report about the disp@@ at@@ ment of soldiers in the supply of soldiers and over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker , the alarm for contam@@ inated water of Flin@@ t strikes . or a wall street in@@ sider who war@@ ns us before the coming financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 &#93; The biggest data le@@ ck of the story was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; huge money sum@@ s &#93; have been hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this week have been asked by news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of Panama &apos;s resident companies
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set it up ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has re@@ signed .
also there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian Dic@@ t@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s mail@@ box had tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children days , a famous cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others , which wait nervous on the next release , and on the next unveiled documents .
this sounds like the Plot of an agent or John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems weeping from you , me , ordinary people .
why should this be ?
but the truth is , if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ases and do not pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , streets .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations of phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few , to hide and lose their assets -- something that we have been discuss@@ ing and reveal for ten years .
I think many people appear very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always put it in front of a Mat@@ ry@@ osh@@ oot .
so , one company has a company in another company , in another company what it is almost impossible to understand who is behind these containers .
it may be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities as well as for journalists or civil society to truly understand what thing is .
I find it interesting that there are less reports on this matter in the USA .
probably because there were no prominent Americans so far , that occurred in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
now it &apos;s not that there is no rich Americans , who can hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ases .
but through the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , mos@@ ets Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American clients .
if we had a data le@@ ck from the Cay@@ man Islands , or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , it is so that you need less information in some US @-@ States to give less information to start a company as to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ surg@@ ent in the US has allowed workers from debt districts to drain school children .
it is allowed to drain , particularly vulner@@ able investors .
it is this kind of behavior that all affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent an out investig@@ ator in the offices of 13 people in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister , the most suspected cash in the USA wanted to buy a house , a yacht to buy a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really sho@@ cked us that all up to one lawyer did to our investig@@ ator , as he might transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were all preliminary results . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course nobody was given to the money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as a single incident .
it is not about a single lawyer who encouraged our conc@@ e@@ aled inquiries .
it is not about a single top pol@@ ishers involved in a sc@@ andal .
it &apos;s about how the system works to be established by corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
to overcome this , we must change the rules .
we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior harder .
this may sound very evil , as if we could do nothing , as if nothing ever changed ; as if it is always the rich and powerful .
but as a saved optim@@ ist I definitely see that some things have to change .
in the last few years we have seen forward towards more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies .
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
ever since , the EU has gras@@ ped the EU at national level , who is really behind firms in Europe and who controls it .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry if they see how other people hide their true identity behind p@@ seu@@ do@@ men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need managers in business , who stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians that recognize the problem and stand up for it by law to end this kind of in@@ surg@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , we can finally stop this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story as I was almost kidn@@ apped and had landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after studying my design studies I started a back@@ yard sales .
there was a guy in the red Maz@@ da and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my art@@ works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . after that he would go to the peace of peace .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where Are You Sle@@ eping Today ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really planning it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot space !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do I pray ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was in bed , I star@@ ed to the blanket and thought : &quot; Oh dear ! what have I broken myself ?
a wild people sleep in my living room .
what if it is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of the bed , on ti@@ cking pointed to the door , and my bedroom door closed .
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the artwork , which he had bought from me , hangs today in his classroom . he is a teacher now .
it was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my viewing angle .
perhaps people who were sold in childhood in childhood are friends who were just waiting to be discovered ?
staying on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my room@@ mate draws and the rent is increased .
I learned that there was a design conference in town at that time . all hotels were fully booked .
I think that creativity can transform it into fun .
I wrote my best friend and new friends Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I wondered how we could earn some things . our apartment will stay at a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers may stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk inclusive , including a mattress and a compli@@ mentary breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and founded such an air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure , our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ ettes is completely different because we made it for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them all the city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed at .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came in roles .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to figure out if you could make it a business concept .
thus we presented the investors : &quot; we would like to create a website that will open public pictures from their private premises , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of rooms , their doors you get when visit comes .
over the Internet , you can un@@ load a wild man to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but they did not act .
no one who is still in sol@@ ace would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we all have lear@@ nt as children , strangers are dangerous .
when one has a problem , one thinks about things you can do . we were designed to design .
at the Academy of Art , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the total experience .
we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create confidence among people who had never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create with design ?
I would like to give you a sample , which degree we confidence .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you &apos;re ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I &apos;d like to unlock you with your mobile phone .
give your mobile phone your left seat .
this silent approach to panic that you can feel -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when you open the door first time .
for the only thing , what is more personal than your mobile phone , is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel that the mobile phone of a stranger does in your hands ?
most people feel responsibility .
so the most guests feel if they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason , our company may exist .
only so , who now has Al Go@@ res cell phone ?
could you please announce Twitter that he is president of the President ?
you can now return your mobile phones now .
you now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discover@@ ies .
what if we had changed a little detail of this experiment ?
what if your neighbor would have imag@@ ined once with his name , when he would have told , where does he come from his dog or his children ?
imagine you could have 150 Be@@ ur@@ als that all say : &quot; he can truly hold off mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel then if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ thought feedback system strength@@ ens the trust .
at the beginning , we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give negative conversion .
ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest have given their distri@@ butions before we launched them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford , how probably it is that people trust one another , depending on how they are similar to the age and residence .
little surprisingly , we trust the people most likely to be the most similar .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social pres@@ umed .
excit@@ ingly , if one adds to the call of a person -- in our case by comm@@ itting .
if one has less than three ass@@ ess@@ ments , nothing changes .
but one has more than ten , changes everything .
a good reputation sign simil@@ ar@@ ities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted pre@@ ferences .
apart from that , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you cost away from yourself .
here you can see the reactions on the first news of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you &apos;re telling too little as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one says too much , as for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother , -- -- the request will rather not be accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enness , e.g. &quot; Great art works in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing vacation with my family . &quot;
how can we create it with design to make this degree of op@@ enness ?
we use the size of the text field , in order to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which themes one should write .
our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
with what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
firstly : unbelie@@ v@@ ably good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need before was not covered before .
the business runs very well for us .
of course , there are times if not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who allowed un@@ allowed parties or have been devast@@ ated .
hosts have left guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood on the front line , when trust became broken .
there is nothing worse than those calls . it doesn &apos;t hurt when I just think .
the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller , and will always be our greatest motivation to improve ourselves further .
luck@@ ily in the 123 million nights there was only one fra@@ ction per problem .
for people trust each other to be right .
when trust works , miracles can arise thereby .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his hosts drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for trav@@ ellers who tend to heart attack activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient nur@@ sing houses .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real f@@ ender that save lives , even though they do not know anything .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you feel lon@@ ely , they bring books over .
they can even stay longer , without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so obviously not every stay runs .
but these relations behind the pure monetary transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions correspond together ?
it is a economic trading here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it just is just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing will not be just . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade which promises human relationships .
people lay a part of itself , and that changes everything .
if you travel nowadays , the fast food is compared to fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what would be , however , if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if you had to visit a group there would be a group that would wait to thoroughly fill a group and show a K@@ nei@@ pent@@ our area , one of which has never heard before ;
or if you could cook from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays flats are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to design apartments from scratch ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would have the idea of a common share ?
I introduce myself to cities which allow society and relations , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and am@@ mer@@ ing .
the South Korean capital of Seoul has already begun this project . many parking spaces that the government belonged to ,
but now residents were offered . students who were looking for a residence , were offered .
were convey@@ ed by people whose kids had moved out . In@@ cub@@ ator programs were started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host .
the idea does not seem so mad , as it was taught .
we did not re@@ invent the wheel .
hospitality has been there before .
there were similar websites to us .
so why exactly did our work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I find it amaz@@ ingly ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
every time I have to think , when a red Maz@@ da passes me .
we know , of course , that design can not solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had a great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think when you watch me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , under@@ wear a bra@@ in@@ wash , a terror@@ ists ?
or just a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the gu@@ ilt for your negative impressions .
thus the media people represent , which look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans mean , most would not know Muslims .
people probably don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to meet you .
I say to you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee owner -- a double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a ch@@ aff@@ ection@@ ate fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I &apos;m a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not so born .
I decided to do that .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ n me .
no , not as a hom@@ osex@@ ual man , like some of my friends but when Muslim . I decided to carry the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why don &apos;t you op@@ press yourself ? &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist independence struggle , which I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt to adapt to a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have been dealing with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought , thought in question , doub@@ ted and believed .
my relationship to God was not love at first sight .
she was a trust and slow dev@@ otion to deep@@ en the coral .
the beauty of rhythm leads me sometimes to wines .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone can tru@@ ce you fully understand , and somehow loves ?
it feels like that .
later , I married and started like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
later on , after my marriage , a child , I lived basically the &quot; Egyptian American dream . &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , looked at the end , looking on the screen and saw the word &quot; Breaking News . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people jum@@ ped out of the buildings .
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical error ?
my shock turned out quickly in anger .
why should one do such a thing ?
&quot; &quot; ... &quot; I changed the channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... , &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; D@@ ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others changed me from one citizen into a susp@@ ect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that same day we had to go through the Middle East in order to move into a new town and to start post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I gra@@ ined -- as we did silence -- so deeply it went into my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as the Muslim .
we moved in this night in our apartment , in a new town where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I saw , and looked , and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations that said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be fool@@ ed you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week .
then there was Friday in that week -- the day where Muslims gather to prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again , the war@@ nings said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is not this first Friday , the mosque would be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were under@@ stand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who were deceived and struck for Muslims .
there were really Bran@@ dan in mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because people who attacked this country , attacked our country .
I have noticed the rage of the people on the terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to keep going to explain .
I do not have any questions , I love questions .
the acc@@ us@@ ations are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays we can actually say people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it &apos;s called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they talk about my church like from a tumor in the body of the USA .
it just raises the question : are we mal@@ icious or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor to keep you under observation .
the alternatives are poin@@ t@@ less because the question is false .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , not tum@@ our in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are Invent@@ ors and Teacher , Er@@ sth@@ el@@ fer and Olymp@@ ians .
will the closure of Mo@@ sche@@ en America make safer ?
there might be a few parking spaces , but do not stop the terror .
regular visit of a mosque brings people to regard people other faith and show greater citizenship .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area told me recently : people actually are not radic@@ alizing in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alized in their cellar or bed in front of a computer .
in the radic@@ alization process , it has been noted that it can be cut off online . even by her family , that the person believes that the person believes that the terror@@ ists don &apos;t believe the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ or their behaviour and their ide@@ ology is a tra@@ itor or by faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some people still say that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS depic@@ ts its brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
as a Muslim , as a mother , I think that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to your imagination world if one recogni@@ zes them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology on their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
but if you have a look at it , it does not matter what it is blown in her &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality , that it lets you read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding im@@ am told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him , because she would have decided to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked if she was in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . any cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken , she brought her to silence , and told her that their anger , her sense of in@@ justice in the world , would have only brought in trouble .
inspired by nothing , and something that has been given to their anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization through extrem@@ ists who spoke a solution .
this im@@ am restored the connection to God and their church .
instead of acc@@ using for their anger , he showed her construc@@ tive paths for real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she kept her to join the IS .
that was an insight as the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia reminds me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 hour consumption of fear each day affect our democracy , on our freedom of thought ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show when we fear , pass at least three things .
we do not accept an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows : when people submit news reports that were reported negative about Muslims , they voted to military attacks against Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just a common problem .
if you &apos;re looking at when the mood against Muslims defeated -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terror@@ ists .
it happened in the ap@@ ron of the war of Iraq and during two periods .
so Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not just the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may indeed be a tool to prevent the public to balance the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the handling with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we sense it as first , but the toxic air of fear wor@@ sen@@ ing all of us .
in the assignment of collective debts , it is not only about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athl@@ ete .
he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , very promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was aston@@ ished and said :
&quot; when did my young woman become such a diversi@@ fied young man ? &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne in her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she killed , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon , as with a execution , after he posted expres@@ sions against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he oss only eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism can not only be imm@@ oral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
have we gone to the mosque or stayed safe at home ?
we had pra@@ ising it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about what America would let us leave our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can ex@@ ert our religion freely .
we decided for the mosque .
we drove in silence with our son at the children &apos;s seat , with high pressure at the mosque .
I took him out , and my shoes went out into the prayer hall , and what I saw was stopped .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Im@@ am had an announcement , than@@ ked and welcomed our guests , because the half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers , and non @-@ believers who were come not to attack us , but by us .
in this moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and sympathy for panic and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
will you be sure to go on number safe ?
or will you join them that mean : we are better than those .
thank you so much .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say , that perhaps they say that you are a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a mind@@ set with drau@@ ght , that is an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look for Muslims all over the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims all over the world , people want to normal things . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
if people appear as a rule , the rule is usually broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
HW : many thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists , is about to become a billions of billions .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial d@@ ron@@ es . made possible in research institutions around the world .
before air p@@ onder@@ ing arrives in our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of flying machines in the F@@ RAC Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower from 1 500 bricks ahead of years ago . some years ago , they began to fly with rop@@ es .
connecting connecting flight machines high speed and acceleration on tight space .
they can also build confidence @-@ free structures .
they have learned to carry bur@@ dens , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you a few of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible flying in autonomous flight .
to make a system autonomous , it must know collec@@ tively , where space is on the mobile objects .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . that enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alisation technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , that determine what the machine should do .
external commands are available on the highest sound e. g. &quot; Start &quot; and end up . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a plane that tries to beat two flying with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient , much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations .
in contrast to most star@@ lings it can float , and has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however there is always a revers@@ er .
a limitation of rear stro@@ kes is that they respond to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn &apos;t matter in which position can achieve optimum position and improves performance by pract@@ ising .
okay .
during our research , we often have basic abstract questions which are due to the core of the cause .
one such question would be , for example , what is the least possible number of mov@@ able parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question .
Hel@@ icop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that accum@@ ulate in order to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots of remote controlled flying systems were flying , which had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ gate .
recently , we discovered that flies with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically sim@@ pl@@ est device . it was invented recently .
it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross@@ bars , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside the interior life is very much , so it can fly ste@@ ady and move in space everywhere .
nevertheless , it has not been equipped with the elegant algorithm of the tail@@ gate . to bring it to the flying , I must really throw it right .
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that it is right to throw me all , is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in inc@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in excess .
what to do with all this passage ?
they see that he is not symmet@@ ric .
this is why he is ambi@@ valent in its direction .
he gets the perpet@@ ually exclusive skill ,
move in space in all directions , no matter in which direction it rot@@ ates or even rot@@ ates .
it is of course complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers .
some models can be displayed in models , the rest will be learned directly when flying .
let us see that .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this plane is made up of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns clock@@ wise .
and the other counter@@ clock@@ wise .
when one builds them , they be@@ have like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong , a motor or prop@@ eller fails , the electronics or one battery -- the machine can fly further if limited .
we will demonstrate this , by making half of air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration exam@@ ines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we used commerci@@ ally micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one disc bread -- and equi@@ p it with loc@@ alisation technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . that &apos;s why there is no upper limit .
hopefully , you can motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to reflect new revolutionary ideas .
using a particularly safe machine , Broadway wants to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology .
for types like us the wages in the development and the creative activity .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that there are creative , smart creatures allowed to form them in so spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such a solid and economic potential is the t@@ ittle in the i .
thank you so much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes revol@@ ve each other in a very far away galaxy so much faster , you turned into pure energy for a ten@@ se of a ten@@ se .
this short moment they bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all the galax@@ ies of the whole universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
they put their power in the form of light , not free .
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was secre@@ ted into space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational shafts .
we arrange the events at first time .
1.3 billion years ago had just emerged from the earth .
since then , the Earth has brought a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people , and -- God gives us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particular bold -- R@@ ai Weiss was decided by the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech -- to search a huge laser det@@ ectors to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them held it crazy .
but enough people recognized it as crazy gen@@ ies , so the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely busy work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ry Gra@@ vit@@ ational shafts .
in the following time , the precision of Lig@@ o could be considerably increased , which greatly improved the detection performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o started to clari@@ fy for some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gravity waves of the two col@@ li@@ ded black holes were ro@@ amed through the earth .
they walked through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : just two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell from my child &apos;s sick .
basically , the fruits of my life were .
all this which I had worked is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been resear@@ ched for 23 years of gravity like Lig@@ o meas@@ ur@@ able signals . but what are gravity waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cro@@ ach@@ ment in the structure of space and time .
while passing the shaft , the space and its whole content will be stretched in one direction and moved into the other .
for illustration , lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses of rel@@ ativity theory often lead a really al@@ ber@@ ly dance .
&quot; expand and du@@ sting , stretch and du@@ de . &quot;
the problem is that gravity waves are extremely weak , even ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
on 14 September , for example , each of us stretched out and explo@@ res the waves . the stretching of an average person was 10 high - 21 .
this means that 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1. by which the Lig@@ o collabor@@ ators declared ins@@ ane .
with a five @-@ kilometer @-@ long laser detector , and that is absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thousand of the radius of an atomic nu@@ cle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text via Gra@@ vit@@ ation
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt after the waves : &quot; technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are huge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ c@@ ists are resour@@ ce@@ ful and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott says that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavelength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite practical , because so you can produce a picture or map of things by keeping the light of the light around you .
for sounds , this is different .
audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean giving you a lot :
face your child &apos;s face .
instead , we listen to specific properties such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; now just Alice is speaking . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; sil@@ ly Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational shafts .
we cannot customize with them images of objects in all .
but by making changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are available .
so when we convert wave pattern to sound , we can literally hear the All .
to listen to the gravity , tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , so my colleague Scott has been busy very long .
S@@ H : two black , not rotating holes , circular : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two body very quickly , you can shoot the same circle with an additional key change . this sounds like : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu boost area wu !
it is a type of movement , stamped in the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget - heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render noise &#93; J@@ V , who knows what he must listen to what he must hear , see this as a sound of -- S@@ H : ... two black holes each with 30 times as fast as the sticks of your mixer .
AA : we &apos;ll think about what this means .
two black holes , the di@@ ch@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 prob@@ es , the other one with a mass of 36 prob@@ es , revol@@ ve each hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these powers .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we heard it .
therein lies the lasting importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o eb@@ net a whole new way to explore the universe , as it never existed before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
we can &apos;t see much in All -- practically or basically -- .
super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars will explo@@ de in super nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about that .
the exciting physical processes are happening at the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through since these op@@ ak are .
Gra@@ vit@@ ations@@ waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it were transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , since the urine is covered by its own after@@ glow .
it should be possible to back up to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of whom we have no idea . things that we only discover when we listen .
in fact , Lig@@ o found the first few things we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o Project , says to this topic : me : the type of stars that bring black holes , as Lig@@ o is observed , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
you are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak the Sau@@ ri@@ er@@ bones for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o allows us to view a completely different angle of view on the history of the stars and ultimately , how we emerged from this may@@ hem .
AA : the challenge now consists to be as bold as only possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the cos@@ mos and cre@@ ep@@ le of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new ob@@ servatory -- a brand new generation of serv@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dreams with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me into un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
do I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a mad thing happened : exactly what I feared , I feared my fear .
keep my fear to keep speaking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my life has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes , which changed my life to an un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly kind . it started with a question of my small ones .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls all the &quot; Evalu@@ ator . &quot;
as if she would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; swe@@ ep , I need milk for my be@@ ak cas@@ hier . &quot;
she once asked me whether I could play with her when I was just on the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new way of life in my family . from then on I s@@ wore to play with them whenever you &apos;re doing it . no matter what I just do , or where I go , I say Yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am really trying .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I understood that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has saved my career with my children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am an author . I think things are aw@@ aking up for life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create TV . I produce TV .
I watch TV in grand style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for this to put 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each show provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars tv , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three episodes at the same time : 24 episodes : episodes , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series runs after one another on Thursday night .
all over the world , my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created and not only produced so . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires that are burning around the world .
do you know who is still doing it ?
nobody . this is why I am a Titan .
dream job .
so I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you &apos;re thinking when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you all of you who work so hard for you to take a company , a business or a classroom , that if I &apos;m talking about work , so you understand that I am not just wander@@ ing on the computer , and it &apos;s right when I say , I don &apos;t understand that you dream about a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all the work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m immersed in the work , there is no different feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it &apos;s when I set up the troops when I painted a painting on canvas .
this is the way for a marathon , lying a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically , ti@@ ring and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and o@@ ily , me@@ tic@@ ul@@ ously and cruel , cruel and sensible . and the best of it is sum@@ s .
there is such a change in me when the work runs well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a sum@@ s starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s are like a busy road , I could go for ever on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many people take it , when I explain to them the sum@@ s , that I tell you writing that writing is joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the Sum@@ mon -- as I began with the television production began when I started working and working , build up , create and collabor@@ ate , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum@@ s !
the sum is more than writing .
the sum@@ s are action and activity . sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s are light and air .
the Sum@@ mon is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , then you can &apos;t look different from size .
the feeling did not feel different compared to size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or perhaps it also means a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s called gen@@ ius .
maybe it is called ego .
maybe it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know I did not succeed for failure , and I only know I love the sum@@ s .
I only want to say to you , I am a Titan , and I know I will not ask it this question .
to make sure , ever more episodes , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more things there are , the more things at the same time , the more things I write , the more expectations there is .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country I create , the marathon , whom I drive , the army , the high tone , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I just this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , over@@ taken , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth , that her mom@@ my is a single business title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says , &quot; Evalu@@ ate , I want to go to Sh@@ onda Land . &quot;
there are the children of a titanium .
they are Baby @-@ Titan@@ en .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s stopped .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my job anymore . the engine was off .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Titan@@ en work , 15 hours @-@ days , processed weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ates , a titanium is not asleep , does not exist , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me , silence was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a flagship Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s was me .
so what do you do when what one does , the work you love , suddenly f@@ ade ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; h@@ ay you out , stupid author Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what you do , you do what you are doing to be a teacher , to be a teacher , a girl who knows how to know the sum@@ s , and knows how to stop sum@@ s when the sum@@ s stops when the sum@@ s stops , who is then ?
what are you ?
what am I am ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song of my heart hears , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way outside , late , and she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mother , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no more than two things will be aware of :
first , I have to say Yes to all and secon@@ dly , she didn &apos;t called me &quot; Evalu@@ ate . &quot;
they do not call any more &quot; Evalu@@ ate . &quot;
when did this happen ?
I understand it , when I am Titanium and my sum@@ s , and here everything changes before my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
we play and their sisters to@@ ast , we laugh a lot and I &apos;m very dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and absence of sum@@ ming , I can &apos;t do anything except watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country I create , the marathon , whom I drive , the army , the army , the tall sound - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
all that exists are sticky finger and mo@@ ist k@@ isses , delicate voices , wa@@ ist@@ al@@ pen@@ cils and the song , in which it goes out , or whatever the girl wants to release &quot; The polar Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me tri@@ ggers .
a mental door goes up and a burst of energy comes in .
and that &apos;s not right away , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audible , but it &apos;s there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the cause .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the working environment , the Titan@@ ens@@ um@@ men , this is just the substitute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I ask you , who you are , if I tell you who I am with the help of broad@@ casts and television and how &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sum@@ s are no power and it is not working specifically .
it depends on the pleasure .
genuine sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s are the power , which comes from the lust of life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ awareness and peace .
real sum@@ s igno@@ res the printing of history , which are to experience , expect@@ ation and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I am doing it as a fixed rule so that I can free myself as Work@@ ah@@ olic from any gu@@ ilt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be that simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing for me is not a little bit like working .
the truth doesn &apos;t hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer at the workplace as at home .
this conc@@ ession is painful , for what kind of man is working rather than to be house ?
well , yes .
to be honest , I call myself &quot; Titan . --
I have to have problems .
that I am a relaxed guy is none of it .
we ra@@ ve around in the garden , facing and back .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we de@@ pressed soap bubbles .
while I feel the mostly st@@ iff , absent , and confused .
I always take my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children tell me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever hear with the games ?
you can also ! they say Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you keep me for nai@@ ve , for a day dream .
you well , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they want to make something different .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ le or bis@@ cuit is replaced .
and speaking my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are just 15 minutes , more requires it .
everyone can bring about 15 minutes a piece , even in a bad mood !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no clothes , no di@@ stra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , ready to finish the children .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . not the children must be . it is to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to play the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what does good for you .
find out and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and be victor@@ ious . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; if you want to play ? &quot; is for a short time when I got up my first TV show when I was my first TV show when I was a Titan in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass more and more .
15 minutes a piece , why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my spare time . the sum@@ s seems to return , when I &apos;m not working .
working doesn &apos;t work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown chant , she fills me and my soul . I use an unknown chant , she fills me and my soul . I use it in full turns and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s are not me ... no more .
bubbles and sticky finger , dinner with friends .
now this is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just a part . and for that I am so grateful .
it &apos;s s@@ nap to me that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , who plays a trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to fewer work and more .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the more happy are I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the country , which I create , the marathon , the k@@ men , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this Sum@@ ma , the more this unusual , descri@@ p@@ tive , naked and new feeling of life within me wide . less titanium - more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum , the more I know who I am .
I am an author . I think things , I awake you to life .
this is a job , which means to live its dream .
that is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to fewer work and more .
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; you want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I am neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I &apos;ve done every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke , or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ surgical .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve function through various surgical measures .
for sure , they have heard from one of the best known h@@ emisph@@ eres , who will im@@ itate an electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so the neurolog@@ ical function was improved .
it is truly an amazing technology . it improves the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease , which suffered severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional Neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
the brain can help themselves with some help .
the history began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency reception .
often I provide patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that the brain is s@@ well@@ ed in the brain @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a and climb@@ s the skull pressure .
to save lives , you have to reduce the skull pressure .
sometimes you need to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain balance .
instead of the s@@ wollen brain balance , we decided to analyse the brain balance with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this fabric .
this is not a slight task .
in order to grow from a tissue piece , comparable to all small children , that can be taken out of your families .
you have to find the proper diet , temperature , humidity and environments to prosp@@ er .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many experiments he managed to Jean @-@ François .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a trunk culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps , you can still know that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ortal .
but these cells were different .
they split slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cellular population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells called Dou@@ ble@@ c@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cer@@ eb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fo@@ etus of the fet@@ us , they ensure the division of the brain .
but why do they keep us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they participate in healing the brain , since we find them in higher concentrations of brain injuries .
this is not so certain .
one thing is however clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand before a potential feed source , which makes brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so , we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain from the non @-@ verbal area and then cultiv@@ ate the cells as it did Jean @-@ François
and then mark them in color to trace them in the brain .
in the last step , we plan@@ ed them at the outlet point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- car transplan@@ tation .
one of our first issues was : what happens if we are plan@@ ing these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we manage the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
with the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with ap@@ es .
in the first scenario , we plan@@ ed the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that they had disappeared after several weeks , they would go back home . the space is already occupied , so they will not be used , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added a violation and was plan@@ ed exactly the same cells , and now the cells remain - they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could see under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells which have been planned .
the evidence of showing them are these little points . these are the cells we use in vitro , in the culture .
of course we could not stop .
can these cells also help to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained ap@@ es with a manual ability .
they had to take feed pellets with one tablet .
they made them very good .
when they reached a stable skill level , we missed the motor motor@@ ized field in the motor Cor@@ tex .
thus , the monkeys were par@@ aly@@ zed , they could not move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen to people , they recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously for some degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover themselves with plastic bra@@ ins . they are re@@ covering to a certain degree , just as with no evil monkeys .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous relaxation , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkey that recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can deliver approximately 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to injury .
it is not as precise and not so fast .
now see when we plan@@ ed the cells , the same monkey , two months after the char@@ m@@ ation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use them later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Park@@ inson &apos;s Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ planted it in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to cure herself .
thank you so much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : yes , that is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need this . &quot;
I definitely need .
of course , the question of what the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials involving human beings .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , one must fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
BG : it is under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ici@@ ate etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and a very professional team .
BG : take a look at the future -- you have completed the research and tried permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years will it take until someone can get into the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
the clinical study depends on the approval of clinical study .
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate it whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multic@@ enter study .
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and BG is sure , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thanks a lot .
democracy .
we in the west make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant that is in reality , but as inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as imm@@ utable abst@@ en@@ ity .
we believe that capitalism leads inev@@ it@@ ably to democracy .
that is not right .
Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w , Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have proved doub@@ t@@ ful that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing of capitalism and impressive growth while the politics stays completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy is van@@ ishing with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I re@@ represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally declared to me that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- do not imp@@ ly the savings programs that were realized in Greece .
in this moment I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w or the Communist Party of China , who would repeatedly test@@ ify to me that democracy would abol@@ ish if they could change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask you to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save us democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ en@@ ant democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy , our societies will waste our future our future and our great , new technologies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point out to an interesting contra@@ diction that is currently under threat to our host families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin summit par@@ adox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain that th@@ rows his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we are all acquain@@ ted with the debt mountain ,
but few know his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash that belongs to the survi@@ ving savers and corpor@@ ations , to invest it there , where it would be productive and gain in@@ comes to which one could produce the debt of debt , which is urg@@ ently needed , for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the USA , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3.4 tr@@ illion dollars were invested in all the wealth of producing goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks and so on and so on .
3.4 tr@@ illion dollars is worth a lot of money , until one compar@@ es it with the $ 5.1 tr@@ illion dollars , which at the same time spent in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did not blow up the stock market prices .
thus , debts and un@@ productive capital make the twin summit that are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is more stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 years old in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , and therefore a low cost @-@ effective demand that could not invest in which they could not invest . just like oil di@@ pus , that would be true to kill him if his son would kill him if he grow .
invol@@ un@@ tary of circumstances brought the circumstances causing Ö@@ di@@ pus to kill him .
that is my v@@ eins of capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; its extremely lav@@ ish art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and especially to finance the technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
but I think before . but before we proceed : what do we mean in democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the corporate form , in which the free and the poor control as a majority of the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally ended too many --
women , aliens , and of course slaves .
however , there would be a mistake to dimin@@ ish the position of ath@@ en@@ ic democracy due to these out@@ crops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisive factor in the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that she gave them the working poor , but was not only the right to freedom of expression , but important and crucial , which they gave them the right to political participation in matters of state @-@ bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not kept long --
like a candle , which shines very bright , it is also quick to burn .
however , our today liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies did not process their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was focused on the free citizens and the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for mist@@ ress .
for the liberal democracy only came on when a full separation from politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was bor@@ dered on politics , while the economy -- thus the world of corpor@@ ations -- a demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ e@@ free zone was observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since that time , when the separation of politics and economy has started , an in@@ ex@@ orable struggle between the two , the economy gradually immig@@ rated to politics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not about the de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is because we can be in the government today , and yet not in power because the power of politics is immig@@ rated into the economy and the areas are separate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a flock of prey that is so sustainable the animals , from which it nour@@ ishes , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ved at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is similar to the economy that the policy is so far can@@ ni@@ b@@ alized that it grows through the self @-@ induced economic crisis itself . the power of corpor@@ ations is increasing , ine@@ quality increases and the managing director of corpor@@ ations are to fri@@ gh@@ ten the cash of their companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the success of capitalism mer@@ its the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the well @-@ being of mankind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we must return to politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ tains the control as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and fore@@ ig@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is no new idea .
the Marxist left already had this idea 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t come out very strange .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only recover through a wonder like in the ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there &apos;s a solution : to abol@@ ish the working arms !
capitalism is doing it , by replaced low wage , by automation and rob@@ otic .
the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation makes the twin summit higher , the waste of hab@@ itation , and the social conflicts lower , as soon as I think -- in countries like China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure we demo@@ cr@@ atically un@@ ify the re@@ unified field , otherwise we end up the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is not , whether capitalism has caused the technological achievements , which he has brought forth , will survive --
&quot; &quot; &quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is bound by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which machines are serving human beings and put their energy into the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ag@@ ora &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in long talks the sense of life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what does it mean to look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; novel utop@@ ia instead of &quot; matrix &quot; of similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in the practical implementation I would like to give you some examples of some examples .
in the area of the company : please imagine a capital market in which you ear@@ ns money while working , and in which your capital is next to you from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which you are currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then all income derived from capital and revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no distinction between those who belong to the company but not working in it , and employees who work there . no pi@@ ke between capital and labour , no big g@@ aps between investment and don@@ or , and ultimately no more emp@@ tive twin summit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the field of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies had a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency that will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest emerging markets &#93; , in the interest of all humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that the whole world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- in units of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- and every government is paying the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade excess of each country into a mutual fund . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that you didn &apos;t have the technical means at that time .
today we have them , especially in the background of a re @-@ united politics and economy .
the world that I describe you is more liberal , in which they privileged persons preferred , and Marxist , because they buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash bin of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar to d@@ yst@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide to make political decisions together .
it is in our hands , and we do it better demo@@ cr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you engage yourself in your biography himself as a liberal Marxist .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I just said is relevant , Marx is relevant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and the economy is ... as we do not , the technological development will produce such a massive decline in overall economic demand that Larry Sum@@ mers is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the transfer of this crisis , from a part of the earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interests in liberal democracy is low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , this is why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and so I am totally perfect .
BG : in fact , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said that . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Red@@ ner you have said very clearly what you think of the view of the west to China .
do you want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a huge degree of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited the democracy on politics , while the area where most plays , -- the area of economy -- a completely demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ an zone is .
in a certain extent , if I may say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to China today in the 19th century .
for -- do you remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was very scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what you can see now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now e@@ ject to do what the West has done for itself in the 19th century , huge kind of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ eners are curious about your experience as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew that coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view@@ point , and very disappoin@@ ting because we had the opportunity to do with the Eurozone a new beginning ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us to say good @-@ bye to compl@@ ac@@ ency , and continuing den@@ ial den@@ ial , that a massive dist@@ ortion line ran through the Eurozone , and continue to continue the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity to be on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal was revealed to den@@ ial .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , continue to deny the den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to obtain an economic system that is not vi@@ able , by political will and auth@@ oring points , you might be able to go out for a while , but if the change occurs , he happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and de@@ structive .
BG : which changes are you looking ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt about the Eurozone , if we do not change the future .
BG : do you have any mistakes in your time being finance minister of finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example , Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Than@@ kl@@ ine ...
if there is a Minister of Finance , or any Minister , who claims after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he did not have a mistake , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest f@@ law was to sign the application for extension of the school program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of the legisl@@ ature to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they only wanted to bring our government , only because they wanted to deal with the dist@@ ortion caused by the euro@@ zone .
they didn &apos;t want to commit that they led a cat@@ astroph@@ ic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there &apos;s worse than &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one from the Tro@@ ika of the pur@@ er , which imposed this policy imposed on us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive actions of talks , you still seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone opposite is of someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone did not survive .
for if they do not survive , the connected cent@@ er@@ ers will be demon@@ ic and destro@@ ying the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not have cat@@ astroph@@ ic consequences for Europe but for the whole world economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we strike the way of a post@@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bear@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Europeans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as well as the non @-@ European . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope very much that you lie wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you very much for you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
by Roy Price , most of them never heard , although he is likely to be responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very enter@@ taining minutes , but not for many of you .
that &apos;s going back to the decision , who met Roy three years ago .
Roy Price is an executive employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an iris and describes on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Movies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for the shows and content to produce the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard strug@@ gling industry .
there are already so many TV shows that Roy could not select any of them .
he must find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are on the right corner of this curve .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are received .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , it is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- all the shows which one has looked , your brain asks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where is there any more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here is shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as -- -- -- this should tell you enough about that at the end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price does not take on the left hand side of the curve , because I think so special intelligence in order to provide &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes himself more thoughts on the middle outlet , the average TV -- the shows which are neither good nor bad , they just love them .
so he must ensure he &apos;s really on the right side .
the print is available , and of course it is also the first time that Amazon is doing something so I want to risk Roy Price nothing .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he with@@ holds a contest .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and introduces them online , where each of them can view .
and if Amazon un@@ ites for free things , you &apos;re going to be right ?
millions of viewers check out these episodes .
however , they do not know they are watched at watching these shows .
they are seen by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
when you start the show , when you start p@@ aus@@ ing , what parts you start or looking at .
they collect millions of data to decide with this data , which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this gives the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four rep@@ ubli@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of this show can remember because it was not so good .
it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of these curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- so something about the average but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company , another manager has placed a top show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly like Roy he is always searching for this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it different .
instead of holding a contest , he and his team have looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , thus the reviews that they will give shows the shows which shows them etc .
then use this data to find out these little details about the viewer : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together they entered a venture , and decided not to make a Sit@@ com through four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Senator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; house of cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competent , data versi@@ fied companies .
you combine this many data and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow manages that this should work with everything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you collect millions of data for a decision that you meet then you should make a good decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
one optimi@@ zes it by very powerful computer .
the min@@ de@@ ste , what you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work so , this is somewhat sc@@ ary because we are living in a time in which we have more and more to stat@@ s to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health System ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in the USA in jail and asking for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is made or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of choosing whether a show will be good or bad , whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , it can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
sorry , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated , not that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies is even wrong .
yes , even Google makes mistakes sometimes .
2009 announced that it is known to pre@@ dict that through data analysis fail@@ ures of flu , the aw@@ ful way -- by data analysis of the Google searches .
it worked wonderfully well and was a big news condition . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year around year until it suddenly did not work anymore ,
and nobody could say .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the release of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data versi@@ fy firms such as Amazon and Google often mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data accum@@ ulate in decisions of life -- in the workplace , in the legal framework , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many trouble with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very smart people use un@@ imagin@@ ably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized a number of patterns via the difference between positive decisions and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dis@@ semin@@ ated .
if you ever need to solve a complex problem , mainly do two things :
first , fix this problem in its components , so you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second place , put the items back together to touch a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : put apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help cut the problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again to assemble , even if the information is incomplete , in order to express a good decision -- especially when it is an expert &apos;s brain .
therefore , I think was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and minds where they also belong in the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they use data to better understand their audience , for why they would not have been able to put together all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was not in the data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a big personal risk with that decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they chose TV ideas , then chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a secure decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data is helpful for better decisions but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and to forget this is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a J@@ A@@ - or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- exactly here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will recall it later with a technical demo .
so far I have taken some decisions in my life so I should listen to the ball in h@@ ind@@ sight .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by some much mis@@ cre@@ ted , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the build @-@ up .
so maybe the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I feel this as a very encour@@ aging news that , despite the great amount of data , it is still worth making decisions in order to be an expert in what you do and risks involved .
for at the end , there are not the data , but the risks associated with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you beautiful .
