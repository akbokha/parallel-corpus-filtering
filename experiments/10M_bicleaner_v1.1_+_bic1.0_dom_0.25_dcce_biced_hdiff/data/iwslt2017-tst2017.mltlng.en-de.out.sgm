<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA was illegal telephones by Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In it he describes a catastrophic US secret service in which the CIA was literally handed down drafts for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, please read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter doesn't like?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US Government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years, the government was determined against Risen, and urged him to name his alleged springs.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train he became a symbol for the pattern of government to condemn Whistleblowers and reporters.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "but it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot obtain this information and if they cannot protect identity of the Mutigen, which they cost." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "so when the government arrived at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him," "" "He refused and told that he would rather go to jail." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the process, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, for years, it had been vital for years, that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government had dropped to Risen." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and Risen, he could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, kept secret from his telephone.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its e-mail, financial and bank information, its credit card, and even travel policy with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistlelower and crafting source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblowers, but the justice had more common than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government gets too much of their job as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since 11 September, almost every article about national security was the result of that a whistleblower ran to a reporter.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, we put the PR working on the game, which should be protected by the first constituent, because the government has more possibilities to spy out all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government's technology allows to circumvent the rights of repeaters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can record it from the moment in which they contact, rather than in hindsight.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software that had not yet been written as Risen had written his book, and it is much safer to call normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transmission system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet of Germany, which was developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, in which I work, developed further.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server, only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can't get more information secretly, and many of the information it would ask would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "unfortunately governments are always developing new spying technologies throughout the world to jeopardize us all over the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="38">It is to make sure that not only technology affairs as Edward Snowden have a way to perform misdeeds. it is just as vital that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to report about the dispatment of soldiers in the supply of soldiers and overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker, the alarm for contaminated water of Flint strikes. or a wall street insider who warns us before the coming financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016] The biggest data leck of the story was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that rich and powerful] [huge money sums] have been hidden in tax havens.] [what does this week have been asked by news about a Leck of 11 million documents of Panama's resident companies</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say," "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set it up?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian Dictator Baschar al-Assad's mailbox had tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children days, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others, which wait nervous on the next release, and on the next unveiled documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">This sounds like the Plot of an agent or John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weeping from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this be?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is, if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havases and do not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, streets.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations of phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by some few, to hide and lose their assets -- something that we have been discussing and reveal for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people appear very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always put it in front of a Matryoshoot.</seg>
<seg id="60">So, one company has a company in another company, in another company what it is almost impossible to understand who is behind these containers.</seg>
<seg id="61">It may be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities as well as for journalists or civil society to truly understand what thing is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are less reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no prominent Americans so far, that occurred in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not that there is no rich Americans, who can hide their assets in tax havases.</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle that these tax havens work, mosets Fonseca has less American clients.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck from the Cayman Islands, or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that you need less information in some US-States to give less information to start a company as to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of insurgent in the US has allowed workers from debt districts to drain school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is allowed to drain, particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that all affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent an out investigator in the offices of 13 people in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator was an African minister, the most suspected cash in the USA wanted to buy a house, a yacht to buy a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we really shocked us that all up to one lawyer did to our investigator, as he might transfer his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all preliminary results. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course nobody was given to the money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as a single incident.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who encouraged our concealed inquiries.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top polishers involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It's about how the system works to be established by corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">To overcome this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior harder.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very evil, as if we could do nothing, as if nothing ever changed; as if it is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a saved optimist I definitely see that some things have to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years we have seen forward towards more transparency, which concerns the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Ever since, the EU has grasped the EU at national level, who is really behind firms in Europe and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry if they see how other people hide their true identity behind pseudomen.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need managers in business, who stand up and say:" "" "intransparent is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians that recognize the problem and stand up for it by law to end this kind of insurgent." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally stop this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story as I was almost kidnapped and had landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after studying my design studies I started a backyard sales.</seg>
<seg id="98">There was a guy in the red Mazda and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artworks.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. after that he would go to the peace of peace.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him," "" "Where Are You Sleeping Today?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really planning it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot space!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "Do I pray?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was in bed, I stared to the blanket and thought: "Oh dear! what have I broken myself?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild people sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if it is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of the bed, on ticking pointed to the door, and my bedroom door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he had bought from me, hangs today in his classroom. he is a teacher now.</seg>
<seg id="120">It was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my viewing angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps people who were sold in childhood in childhood are friends who were just waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">Staying on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate draws and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in town at that time. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think that creativity can transform it into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new friends Brian Chesky: "Brian, I wondered how we could earn some things. our apartment will stay at a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers may stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk inclusive, including a mattress and a complimentary breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and founded such an air mattress and breakfast "[AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure, our cheese ham Omelettes is completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all the city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared at.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came in roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to figure out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">Thus we presented the investors: "we would like to create a website that will open public pictures from their private premises, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of rooms, their doors you get when visit comes.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, you can unload a wild man to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they did not act.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in solace would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all have learnt as children, strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">When one has a problem, one thinks about things you can do. we were designed to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Art, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the total experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create confidence among people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample, which degree we confidence.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you're ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to unlock you with your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your mobile phone your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent approach to panic that you can feel -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when you open the door first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing, what is more personal than your mobile phone, is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel that the mobile phone of a stranger does in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So the most guests feel if they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason, our company may exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only so, who now has Al Gores cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce Twitter that he is president of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return your mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail of this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor would have imagined once with his name, when he would have told, where does he come from his dog or his children?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you could have 150 Beurals that all say: "he can truly hold off mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel then if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-thought feedback system strengthens the trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning, we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative conversion.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest have given their distributions before we launched them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford, how probably it is that people trust one another, depending on how they are similar to the age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust the people most likely to be the most similar.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social presumed.</seg>
<seg id="181">Excitingly, if one adds to the call of a person -- in our case by committing.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation sign similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Apart from that, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you cost away from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions on the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you're telling too little as" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one says too much, as for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother, -- -- the request will rather not be accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g. "Great art works in your apartment! I'm doing vacation with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field, in order to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which themes one should write.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">Firstly: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need before was not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business runs very well for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times if not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who allowed unallowed parties or have been devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have left guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood on the front line, when trust became broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than those calls. it doesn't hurt when I just think.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the caller, and will always be our greatest motivation to improve ourselves further.</seg>
<seg id="208">Luckily in the 123 million nights there was only one fraction per problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other to be right.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, miracles can arise thereby.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers who tend to heart attack activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient nursing houses.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real fender that save lives, even though they do not know anything.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer, without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So obviously not every stay runs.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure monetary transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions correspond together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a economic trading here.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it just is just" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing will not be just." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade which promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of itself, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you travel nowadays, the fast food is compared to fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would be, however, if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if you had to visit a group there would be a group that would wait to thoroughly fill a group and show a Kneipentour area, one of which has never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could cook from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays flats are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to design apartments from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have the idea of a common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I introduce myself to cities which allow society and relations, instead of loneliness and ammering.</seg>
<seg id="239">The South Korean capital of Seoul has already begun this project. many parking spaces that the government belonged to,</seg>
<seg id="240">But now residents were offered. students who were looking for a residence, were offered.</seg>
<seg id="241">Were conveyed by people whose kids had moved out. Incubator programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea does not seem so mad, as it was taught.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality has been there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites to us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why exactly did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it amazingly,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">Every time I have to think, when a red Mazda passes me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design can not solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had a great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, underwear a brainwash, a terrorists?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the guilt for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">Thus the media people represent, which look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean, most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">People probably don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I say to you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee owner -- a double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A chaffectionate fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not so born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do that.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to oun me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends but when Muslim. I decided to carry the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why don't you oppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time, it was a feminist independence struggle, which I felt as 17-year-old felt to adapt to a perfect and unreachable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have been dealing with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, thought in question, doubted and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship to God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was a trust and slow devotion to deepen the coral.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm leads me sometimes to wines.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone can truce you fully understand, and somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later, I married and started like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">Later on, after my marriage, a child, I lived basically the "Egyptian American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, looked at the end, looking on the screen and saw the word "Breaking News."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was it?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical error?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned out quickly in anger.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">""... "I changed the channel and heard:" ""... "Muslim terrorists..." ""... "in the name of Islam...," ""... "Djihad..." ""... "" ""</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">"" "" "" "it is not only my country being attacked, but in the Nu the deeds of others changed me from one citizen into a suspect." ""</seg>
<seg id="302">That same day we had to go through the Middle East in order to move into a new town and to start postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I grained -- as we did silence -- so deeply it went into my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as the Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved in this night in our apartment, in a new town where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "then I saw, and looked, and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said," "" "Be careful," "" "Stay in well lit areas," "" "Don't be fooled you." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then there was Friday in that week -- the day where Muslims gather to prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again, the warnings said," "" "Is not this first Friday, the mosque would be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who were deceived and struck for Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really Brandan in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who attacked this country, attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have noticed the rage of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to keep going to explain.</seg>
<seg id="318">I do not have any questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">The accusations are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"" "nowadays we can actually say people:" "" "there is a problem in this country -- it's called Muslims." ""</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They talk about my church like from a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It just raises the question: are we malicious or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor to keep you under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, not tumour in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are Inventors and Teacher, Ersthelfer and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of Moscheen America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There might be a few parking spaces, but do not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit of a mosque brings people to regard people other faith and show greater citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area told me recently: people actually are not radicalizing in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their cellar or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radicalization process, it has been noted that it can be cut off online. even by her family, that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists don't believe the true Muslims, and everyone who abhor their behaviour and their ideology is a traitor or by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some people still say that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS depicts its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, I think that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to your imagination world if one recognizes them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But if you have a look at it, it does not matter what it is blown in her "Holy Scripture."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality, that it lets you read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because she would have decided to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked if she was in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. any clergy with whom she had spoken, she brought her to silence, and told her that their anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would have only brought in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing, and something that has been given to their anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization through extremists who spoke a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam restored the connection to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing for their anger, he showed her constructive paths for real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept her to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight as the Islamophobia reminds me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24 hour consumption of fear each day affect our democracy, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show when we fear, pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We do not accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: when people submit news reports that were reported negative about Muslims, they voted to military attacks against Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just a common problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you're looking at when the mood against Muslims defeated -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the apron of the war of Iraq and during two periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not just the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "it may indeed be a tool to prevent the public to balance the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens." ""</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We sense it as first, but the toxic air of fear worsening all of us.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective debts, it is not only about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, very promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, most generous man whom she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was astonished and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when did my young woman become such a diversified young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne in her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she killed, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting the afternoon, as with a execution, after he posted expressions against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He oss only eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Have we gone to the mosque or stayed safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We had praising it and for us it was no easy decision, because it was about what America would let us leave our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can exert our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">We drove in silence with our son at the children's seat, with high pressure at the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and my shoes went out into the prayer hall, and what I saw was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam had an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because the half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers, and non-believers who were come not to attack us, but by us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In this moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and sympathy for panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be sure to go on number safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join them that mean: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say, that perhaps they say that you are a TEDTalk, a mindset with draught, that is an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I am completely normal.</seg>

<seg id="407">What started as a platform for hobbyists, is about to become a billions of billions.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. made possible in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air pondering arrives in our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of flying machines in the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-metre-high tower from 1 500 bricks ahead of years ago. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Connecting connecting flight machines high speed and acceleration on tight space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build confidence-free structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry burdens, deal with turmoil and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you a few of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible flying in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">To make a system autonomous, it must know collectively, where space is on the mobile objects.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. that enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localisation technology of Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, that determine what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available on the highest sound e. g. "Start" and end up. "</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A plane that tries to beat two flying with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starlings it can float, and has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However there is always a reverser.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear strokes is that they respond to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn't matter in which position can achieve optimum position and improves performance by practising.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often have basic abstract questions which are due to the core of the cause.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be, for example, what is the least possible number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that accumulate in order to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots of remote controlled flying systems were flying, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a tailgate.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently, we discovered that flies with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and crossbars, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, inside the interior life is very much, so it can fly steady and move in space everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it has not been equipped with the elegant algorithm of the tailgate. to bring it to the flying, I must really throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood that it is right to throw me all, is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If monospinner is an exercise in incelty, this machine is here, the bus with its eight propellers, an exercise in excess.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this passage?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is not symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">This is why he is ambivalent in its direction.</seg>
<seg id="446">He gets the perpetually exclusive skill,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions, no matter in which direction it rotates or even rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">It is of course complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some models can be displayed in models, the rest will be learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This plane is made up of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counterclockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When one builds them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong, a motor or propeller fails, the electronics or one battery -- the machine can fly further if limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this, by making half of airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We used commercially micro-quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one disc bread -- and equip it with localisation technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. that's why there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you can motivate these demonstrations to reflect new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">Using a particularly safe machine, Broadway wants to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the wages in the development and the creative activity.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that there are creative, smart creatures allowed to form them in so spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such a solid and economic potential is the tittle in the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes revolve each other in a very far away galaxy so much faster, you turned into pure energy for a tense of a tense.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they brighter than all the stars together in all the galaxies of the whole universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">They put their power in the form of light, not free.</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was secreted into space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational shafts.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago had just emerged from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the Earth has brought a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people, and -- God gives us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particular bold -- Rai Weiss was decided by the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech -- to search a huge laser detectors to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them held it crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized it as crazy genies, so the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely busy work they built the detector Ligo: the laser interferometry Gravitational shafts.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following time, the precision of Ligo could be considerably increased, which greatly improved the detection performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo started to clarify for some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravity waves of the two collided black holes were roamed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They walked through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: just two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my child's sick.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, the fruits of my life were.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this which I had worked is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been researched for 23 years of gravity like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravity waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a croachment in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">While passing the shaft, the space and its whole content will be stretched in one direction and moved into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, lecturers in courses of relativity theory often lead a really alberly dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"expand and dusting, stretch and dude."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravity waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On 14 September, for example, each of us stretched out and explores the waves. the stretching of an average person was 10 high - 21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means that 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. by which the Ligo collaborators declared insane.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer-long laser detector, and that is absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousand of the radius of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text via Gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of LIGOs, the hunt after the waves: "technical difficulties in building such detectors are huge.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are resourceful and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott says that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because so you can produce a picture or map of things by keeping the light of the light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">For sounds, this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean giving you a lot:</seg>
<seg id="512">Face your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to specific properties such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just Alice is speaking."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"silly Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational shafts.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot customize with them images of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by making changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are available.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave pattern to sound, we can literally hear the All.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity, tell us about the collision of two black holes, so my colleague Scott has been busy very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, circular: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two body very quickly, you can shoot the same circle with an additional key change. this sounds like: Wu-wu-wu boost area wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a type of movement, stamped in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget - heard the following: [Surrender noise] JV, who knows what he must listen to what he must hear, see this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes each with 30 times as fast as the sticks of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: we'll think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the dichest body in all, one with a mass of 29 probes, the other one with a mass of 36 probes, revolve each hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these powers.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the lasting importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo ebnet a whole new way to explore the universe, as it never existed before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in All -- practically or basically --.</seg>
<seg id="536">Supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars will explode in super novae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about that.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes are happening at the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through since these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitationswaves penetrate iron, as if it were transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, since the urine is covered by its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">It should be possible to back up to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen, and of whom we have no idea. things that we only discover when we listen.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found the first few things we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo Project, says to this topic: me: the type of stars that bring black holes, as Ligo is observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">You are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak the Saurierbones for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo allows us to view a completely different angle of view on the history of the stars and ultimately, how we emerged from this mayhem.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now consists to be as bold as only possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the cosmos and creeple of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatory -- a brand new generation of servatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>

<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a mad thing happened: exactly what I feared, I feared my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">Keep my fear to keep speaking, my social fear -- puff, away.</seg>

<seg id="566">"" "" "" "my life has changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes, which changed my life to an unexpectedly kind. it started with a question of my small ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls all the "Evaluator."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"sweep, I need milk for my beak cashier."</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked me whether I could play with her when I was just on the jump. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new way of life in my family. from then on I swore to play with them whenever you're doing it. no matter what I just do, or where I go, I say Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am really trying.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">"" "but it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I understood that" "" "Yes" "" "has saved my career with my children." ""</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am an author. I think things are awaking up for life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I produce TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I watch TV in grand style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for this to put 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each show provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days four shows, i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars tv, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three episodes at the same time: 24 episodes: episodes, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series runs after one another on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created and not only produced so. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires that are burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing it?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody. this is why I am a Titan.</seg>

<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you're thinking when the word" "" "author" "" "will be." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you all of you who work so hard for you to take a company, a business or a classroom, that if I'm talking about work, so you understand that I am not just wandering on the computer, and it's right when I say, I don't understand that you dream about a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all the work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm immersed in the work, there is no different feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's when I set up the troops when I painted a painting on canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">This is the way for a marathon, lying a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, tiring and intoxicating, funny and oily, meticulously and cruel, cruel and sensible. and the best of it is sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work runs well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"" "" "" "a sums starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums are like a busy road, I could go for ever on it." ""</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take it, when I explain to them the sums, that I tell you writing that writing is joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the Summon -- as I began with the television production began when I started working and working, build up, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums are action and activity. sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums are light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The Summon is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, then you can't look different from size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling did not feel different compared to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know I did not succeed for failure, and I only know I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I only want to say to you, I am a Titan, and I know I will not ask it this question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make sure, ever more episodes, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more things there are, the more things at the same time, the more things I write, the more expectations there is.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country I create, the marathon, whom I drive, the army, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overtaken, exaggerated, exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth, that her mommy is a single business title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says, "Evaluate, I want to go to Shonda Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titanen work, 15 hours-days, processed weekends, no remorse, nothing delegates, a titanium is not asleep, does not exist, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me, silence was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a flagship Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums was me.</seg>

<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I am?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>

<seg id="673">And I want to say no more than two things will be aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say Yes to all and secondly, she didn't called me "Evaluate."</seg>
<seg id="675">They do not call any more "Evaluate."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I understand it, when I am Titanium and my sums, and here everything changes before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mama, you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about that.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and their sisters toast, we laugh a lot and I'm very dramatic from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it's outstanding because my pain and panic, in solitude and absence of summing, I can't do anything except watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I create, the marathon, whom I drive, the army, the army, the tall sound - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky finger and moist kisses, delicate voices, waistalpencils and the song, in which it goes out, or whatever the girl wants to release "The polar Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me triggers.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and a burst of energy comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that's not right away, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>

<seg id="718">I am doing it as a fixed rule so that I can free myself as Workaholic from any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be that simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing for me is not a little bit like working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth doesn't hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer at the workplace as at home.</seg>

<seg id="728">To be honest, I call myself "Titan. --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>

<seg id="736">I always take my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children tell me how to live, and the sums of the universe fills me.</seg>

<seg id="740">You can also! they say Yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you keep me for naive, for a day dream.</seg>
<seg id="742">You well, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they want to make something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladle or biscuit is replaced.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speaking my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are just 15 minutes, more requires it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can bring about 15 minutes a piece, even in a bad mood!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no clothes, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, ready to finish the children.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. not the children must be. it is to feel the sums to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what does good for you.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I fail and be victorious. meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"if you want to play?" is for a short time when I got up my first TV show when I was my first TV show when I was a Titan in training, when I wanted to surpass more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seems to return, when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door opens and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown chant, she fills me and my soul. I use an unknown chant, she fills me and my soul. I use it in full turns and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums, the sums are not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">Now this is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of me, but just a part. and for that I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's snap to me that I am a Titan. I've never seen a Titan, who plays a trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to fewer work and more.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my campfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the more happy are I and my children.</seg>

<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clear is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country, which I create, the marathon, the kmen, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this Summa, the more this unusual, descriptive, naked and new feeling of life within me wide. less titanium - more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sum, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am an author. I think things, I awake you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is a job, which means to live its dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">That is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a bit dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to fewer work and more.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I've done every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke, or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional Neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve function through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">For sure, they have heard from one of the best known hemispheres, who will imitate an electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neurons so the neurological function was improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it improves the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, which suffered severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional Neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">The brain can help themselves with some help.</seg>
<seg id="811">The history began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency reception.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provide patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that the brain is swelled in the brain-brain traumata and climbs the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save lives, you have to reduce the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you need to remove a part of swollen brain balance.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of the swollen brain balance, we decided to analyse the brain balance with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this fabric.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not a slight task.</seg>
<seg id="821">In order to grow from a tissue piece, comparable to all small children, that can be taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the proper diet, temperature, humidity and environments to prosper.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many experiments he managed to Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a trunk culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps, you can still know that stem cells are immature cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cellular population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the foetus of the fetus, they ensure the division of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they keep us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in healing the brain, since we find them in higher concentrations of brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">This is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is however clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand before a potential feed source, which makes brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain from the non-verbal area and then cultivate the cells as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we planed them at the outlet point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- car transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first issues was: what happens if we are planing these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we manage the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">With the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we planed the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that they had disappeared after several weeks, they would go back home. the space is already occupied, so they will not be used, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added a violation and was planed exactly the same cells, and now the cells remain - they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could see under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells which have been planned.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence of showing them are these little points. these are the cells we use in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained apes with a manual ability.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets with one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level, we missed the motor motorized field in the motor Cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Thus, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could not move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to people, they recovered spontaneously for some degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover themselves with plastic brains. they are recovering to a certain degree, just as with no evil monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous relaxation, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey that recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can deliver approximately 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we planed the cells, the same monkey, two months after the charmation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implanted it in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to cure herself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: yes, that is wonderful, I'm sure that now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need this."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely need.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question of what the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials involving human beings.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, one must fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: it is understandable, the brain is very deliciate etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it needs a long time, a lot of patience and a very professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: take a look at the future -- you have completed the research and tried permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years will it take until someone can get into the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">The clinical study depends on the approval of clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate it whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and BG is sure, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thanks a lot.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the west make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality, but as inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as immutable abstenity.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism leads inevitably to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not right.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have proved doubtful that it is quite possible to have a flourishing of capitalism and impressive growth while the politics stays completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy is vanishing with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I rerepresented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally declared to me that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- do not imply the savings programs that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">In this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, who would repeatedly testify to me that democracy would abolish if they could change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"" "" "" "I ask you to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save us democracy, but that we need a truthful and defenant democracy." ""</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "for without democracy, our societies will waste our future our future and our great, new technologies." ""</seg>
<seg id="914">"" "" "" "on the subject of waste, I would like to point out to an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our host families." ""</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin summit paradox." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">One summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain that throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We are all acquainted with the debt mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few know his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">"" "a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the surviving savers and corporations, to invest it there, where it would be productive and gain incomes to which one could produce the debt of debt, which is urgently needed, for example" "" "green" "" "energy." ""</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the USA, in England and in the eurozone, 3.4 trillion dollars were invested in all the wealth of producing goods such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion dollars is worth a lot of money, until one compares it with the $5.1 trillion dollars, which at the same time spent in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did not blow up the stock market prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debts and unproductive capital make the twin summit that are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is more stagnating wages, more than a quarter of 25-54 years old in the USA, Japan and Europe unemployed, and therefore a low cost-effective demand that could not invest in which they could not invest. just like oil dipus, that would be true to kill him if his son would kill him if he grow.</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntary of circumstances brought the circumstances causing Ödipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my veins of capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"" "its extremely lavish art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents, and especially to finance the technologies," "" "green" "" "technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth." ""</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But I think before. but before we proceed: what do we mean in democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the corporate form, in which the free and the poor control as a majority of the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally ended too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, aliens, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, there would be a mistake to diminish the position of athenic democracy due to these outcrops.</seg>
<seg id="934">"" "" "" "the decisive factor in the athenian democracy was and is that she gave them the working poor, but was not only the right to freedom of expression, but important and crucial, which they gave them the right to political participation in matters of state-belongings." ""</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not kept long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which shines very bright, it is also quick to burn.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our today liberal democracies did not process their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy was focused on the free citizens and the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for mistress.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy only came on when a full separation from politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was bordered on politics, while the economy -- thus the world of corporations -- a democratiefree zone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="941">"" "" "" "in our present democracies, since that time, when the separation of politics and economy has started, an inexorable struggle between the two, the economy gradually immigrated to politics." ""</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not about the degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"" "" "" "it is because we can be in the government today, and yet not in power because the power of politics is immigrated into the economy and the areas are separate." ""</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a flock of prey that is so sustainable the animals, from which it nourishes, decimated that they are starved at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">"" "" "" "it is similar to the economy that the policy is so far cannibalized that it grows through the self-induced economic crisis itself. the power of corporations is increasing, inequality increases and the managing director of corporations are to frighten the cash of their companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="948">The success of capitalism merits the "demos" [the people] from democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the well-being of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">"" "" "" "if this is true, it is obvious that we must return to politics and the economy, and it would be better if the" "" "Demos" "" "retains the control as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigner." ""</seg>
<seg id="950">This is no new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left already had this idea 100 years ago and it didn't come out very strange.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only recover through a wonder like in the ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there's a solution: to abolish the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it, by replaced low wage, by automation and robotic.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, the automation makes the twin summit higher, the waste of habitation, and the social conflicts lower, as soon as I think -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "so we have to reunite the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure we democratically unify the reunified field, otherwise we end up the film" "" "Matrix" "" "as a documentation." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not, whether capitalism has caused the technological achievements, which he has brought forth, will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">"" "the more interesting question is whether capitalism is bound by a dystopia, similar to that of" "" "Star Trek" "", "in which machines are serving human beings and put their energy into the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" "" "Agora" "", "in long talks the sense of life." ""</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what does it mean to look like this "Star Trek" novel utopia instead of "matrix" of similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In the practical implementation I would like to give you some examples of some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of the company: please imagine a capital market in which you earns money while working, and in which your capital is next to you from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which you are currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">"" "" "" "then all income derived from capital and revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled." ""</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company but not working in it, and employees who work there. no pike between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and donor, and ultimately no more emptive twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">"" "in the field of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies had a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency that will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 largest emerging markets], in the interest of all humanity." ""</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "imagine that the whole world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" "" "Cosmos" "" "-- in units of" "" "cosmos" "" "-- and every government is paying the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade excess of each country into a mutual fund." ""</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that you didn't have the technical means at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially in the background of a re-united politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I describe you is more liberal, in which they privileged persons preferred, and Marxist, because they buried the separation of capital and work in the trash bin of history, and keynesian, global keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar to dystia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to make political decisions together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You engage yourself in your biography himself as a liberal Marxist.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I just said is relevant, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"" "" "" "the reason for reunification of politics and the economy is... as we do not, the technological development will produce such a massive decline in overall economic demand that Larry Summers is called" "" "long-term stagnation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"" "" "" "through the transfer of this crisis, from a part of the earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interests in liberal democracy is low." ""</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, this is why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and so I am totally perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: in fact, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said that. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Redner you have said very clearly what you think of the view of the west to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Do you want to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a huge degree of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited the democracy on politics, while the area where most plays, -- the area of economy -- a completely democratian zone is.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain extent, if I may say this provocative, China is similar to China today in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- do you remember -- we tend to link liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was very sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What you can see now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now eject to do what the West has done for itself in the 19th century, huge kind of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I knew that coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal viewpoint, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to do with the Eurozone a new beginning,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "for us to say good-bye to complacency, and continuing denial denial, that a massive distortion line ran through the Eurozone, and continue to continue the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity to be on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal was revealed to denial.</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, continue to deny the denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to obtain an economic system that is not viable, by political will and authoring points, you might be able to go out for a while, but if the change occurs, he happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: which changes are you looking ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt about the Eurozone, if we do not change the future.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: do you have any mistakes in your time being finance minister of finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example, YV: everyone who looks back -- Thankline...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister of Finance, or any Minister, who claims after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, he did not have a mistake, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest flaw was to sign the application for extension of the school program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of the legislature to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They only wanted to bring our government, only because they wanted to deal with the distortion caused by the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to commit that they led a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There's worse than "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "no one from the Troika of the purer, which imposed this policy imposed on us," "" "that was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive actions of talks, you still seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone opposite is of someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the eurozone did not survive.</seg>

<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most of them never heard, although he is likely to be responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That's going back to the decision, who met Roy three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is an executive employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an iris and describes on Twitter as" "" "Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for the shows and content to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard struggling industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV shows that Roy could not select any of them.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are on the right corner of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are received.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, it is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" "" "Breaking Bad," "" "Game of Thrones," "" "The Wire," "" "-- all the shows which one has looked, your brain asks," "" "Where is there any more of these episodes?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left, here is shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras -- -- -- this should tell you enough about that at the end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not take on the left hand side of the curve, because I think so special intelligence in order to provide "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes himself more thoughts on the middle outlet, the average TV -- the shows which are neither good nor bad, they just love them.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure he's really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The print is available, and of course it is also the first time that Amazon is doing something so I want to risk Roy Price nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he withholds a contest.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and introduces them online, where each of them can view.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon unites for free things, you're going to be right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers check out these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know they are watched at watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are seen by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">When you start the show, when you start pausing, what parts you start or looking at.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with this data, which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them and this gives the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many of this show can remember because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of these curve is 7.4 and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- so something about the average but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company, another manager has placed a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. exactly like Roy he is always searching for this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a contest, he and his team have looked at the existing data on the Netflix audience, thus the reviews that they will give shows the shows which shows them etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then use this data to find out these little details about the viewer: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they entered a venture, and decided not to make a Sitcom through four senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "house of cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competent, data versified companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">You combine this many data and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow manages that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"" "" "" "if you collect millions of data for a decision that you meet then you should make a good decision." ""</seg>
<seg id="1086">We have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">One optimizes it by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The mindeste, what you can expect is good TV, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work so, this is somewhat scary because we are living in a time in which we have more and more to stats to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health System?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in the USA in jail and asking for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is made or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of choosing whether a show will be good or bad, whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, it can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Sorry, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated, not that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced companies is even wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">2009 announced that it is known to predict that through data analysis failures of flu, the awful way -- by data analysis of the Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully well and was a big news condition. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around year until it suddenly did not work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the release of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data versify firms such as Amazon and Google often misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data accumulate in decisions of life -- in the workplace, in the legal framework, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many trouble with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized a number of patterns via the difference between positive decisions and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you ever need to solve a complex problem, mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, fix this problem in its components, so you can analyse the individual parts; as a second place, put the items back together to touch a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: put apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help cut the problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again to assemble, even if the information is incomplete, in order to express a good decision -- especially when it is an expert's brain.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think was Netflix so successful because they have used data and minds where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">"" "they use data to better understand their audience, for why they would not have been able to put together all these parts, and make it a show like" "" "House of Cards" "", "which was not in the data." ""</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a big personal risk with that decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they chose TV ideas, then chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a secure decision because they could always say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"" "" "" "data is helpful for better decisions but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions." ""</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and to forget this is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it's amazing. for decisions using a JA- or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- exactly here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will recall it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have taken some decisions in my life so I should listen to the ball in hindsight.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by some much miscreted, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the build-up.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging news that, despite the great amount of data, it is still worth making decisions in order to be an expert in what you do and risks involved.</seg>
<seg id="1137">For at the end, there are not the data, but the risks associated with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
