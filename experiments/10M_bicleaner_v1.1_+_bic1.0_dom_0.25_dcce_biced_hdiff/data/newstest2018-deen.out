Munich , 1856 : four cards that change your view to the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people are to meet today .
a pit chapel , which is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
peas@@ ant gar@@ den@@ ies econom@@ ies the erst@@ while of farmers .
the oldest official card coin supports exciting stories .
it gets nervous when maps are not up to date .
this knows everyone who had to stum@@ bled herself , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i was showing a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historic maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bayern of the State Government , are all others but actually very illumin@@ ating .
especially when compar@@ ing them with current online cards .
it becomes clear how cities and municip@@ alities in the wider area of Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bay@@ at@@ las is a Flick@@ ep@@ ark which you do not know as such .
in the great overview map for cities and municip@@ alities , more detailed maps , so @-@ called pri@@ mal power sheets , were incorporated .
these were created according to the Bavarian survey@@ ing management between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and soli@@ di@@ fy the first survey@@ ing of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader worked in Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
finally , when the French troops entered the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 1801 , there were today &apos;s neigh@@ bors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern District .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV Joseph advanced the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ograph@@ ical Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian government office .
the Ur@@ al University for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found as all others on the Bavarian State Library website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the comparison early / today is the state capital of the most impressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the town has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is an infer@@ ior to occur relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
S@@ end@@ ling was born 21 years after the construction of the map , in 1877 , in Munich &apos;s district .
today , sub @-@ send@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses of sub @-@ spirits are concentrated around the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er in 1878 , a leader of the Bavarian farmers in Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing as fields - at first glance : at first glance , a small @-@ part map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written entries from the so @-@ called &apos; Ur@@ als &apos; , derived from the basic tax .
today , small plots are still not farmers anymore - but a gar@@ dener to the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area distingu@@ ishes north of Un@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 , became the scene of the Oktober@@ fest , was in the 19th century a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other hand side of the Is@@ ar gives the historical map a glimpse of the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
according to the &apos; Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen district , you can not only read the street name at Gast@@ on &quot; or from the hill &quot; on the air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here on the Au@@ er@@ field street one once locked people with mad@@ ness .
there was in 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; erected at the Au@@ er Lü@@ nen . &quot;
in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den accompanied the establishment of a psychiat@@ rist that was brought to death by King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced for his time and ended for example the chains of the so @-@ called mad@@ men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he is prohibited to use the personnel to apply violence against the passengers , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen museum which has worked for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt .
for 280 patients had been at first place , and later extended to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circle of cycles in hair 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ry , has been there since 2006 .
on the premises of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt young people are now encounter in the Munich Sal@@ es@@ ian region .
the Order acquired the complex of buildings in 1920 and was converted into a youth hostel with training .
West is located west of the TS@@ V Munich east , East residential buildings dating from the 1980s .
in 2015 , we built the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; - in architectural acc@@ ust@@ omed to the origin of origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during World War II during World War II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Marien@@ platz was listed in 1856 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the merchants called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change was also in the heart of the Second World War .
the Allied forces broke down many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
until now , a great stay - at the Marien@@ hof .
the English institute , small business buildings and a Gru@@ ft@@ ap@@ el from the Middle Ages stood at the Marien@@ hof where these days were to work and the Sp@@ at@@ enst@@ ich will take place for the second S @-@ Bahn stations .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich @-@ map can be compared with the aerial view of today and filling the hole in the Marien@@ hof .
the Civil Code published Travel Guide for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ ou@@ reds issued a warning for coloured people who travel to the disc@@ rimin@@ atory policy and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will come into force by August 28 , 2017 , invites you to bring special attention to visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i , as a number of frag@@ mentary , ra@@ cial rac@@ tions in the last time loc@@ alities and here , &quot; says it in the statement of the group .
a recently approved law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , who makes people more difficult to disc@@ rimin@@ ate against discrimination , as well as the prosec@@ utions of the state , the disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate of min@@ orities , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of the civil rights that happen to men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped or killed because of their skin color , they are gathered or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such a warning that organis@@ es the organization for a state in the US .
the Group iti@@ oned inci@@ dents like rac@@ ist aband@@ oning against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died under frag@@ ile circumstances in the beginning of the year after he had no fuel during the journey through the state and convicted by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i , without being accused of a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council also pointed out a recent report from the Office of Mis@@ sour@@ i , a recent report which is shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than whit@@ eness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of their families , friends and staff about what might happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; Chapel said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be ready to bring it che@@ ers or let the relative know that they go through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 ass@@ ay ass@@ aults in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FB@@ I report which entered the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th level of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , while the United States immig@@ ration laws had ple@@ dge to conf@@ use people because of mig@@ rating issues , which will contribute to the view of AC@@ L@@ U to further race course .
travel war@@ nings is usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of other countries , but l@@ ately , st@@ ak@@ eholders have employed the action as a reaction to certain laws and trends in the US .
dec@@ aun@@ ching project is elementary
the F@@ ish@@ bacher @-@ F@@ aun project is a success project and will continue throughout the next year .
the CDU @-@ Bun@@ dest@@ al @-@ contained Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have provided an image on the spot .
in the legal back@@ yard of the family Schwen@@ demann re@@ members of the fisher@@ man CDU @-@ village association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ demann re@@ tains insights into his operation in which he farms 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many kit@@ ten and also houses in five apartments .
&quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch is &quot; for him the alternative labour market for milk of its cows , so sw@@ demann .
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este you only comes to regional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as it is also the BL@@ HV @-@ chairman of F@@ ish@@ bach , he described the ref@@ ill project as &quot; elementary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t work on such steep surfaces .
the green area , a lot of work , can be processed with the brush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the responsible operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it has no bio@@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e recognized the meaning of the dec@@ aun@@ tory project and is glad to promote leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euro per hectare , farmers need to be supported .
it was hop@@ ed that the aff@@ o@@ rest@@ ation of surfaces could be moved out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often in criticism for the promotion
over the course of 2013 , a total of 25 par@@ c@@ els were fenced by eleven participants in 2013 .
the disclos@@ ure area is thus 40 hectares , which may not be opened up to at least 20@@ 23 .
half about leader was promoted by the total costs of 71 500 Euros , a quarter contributed to the village of F@@ ish@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained in charge of 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of f@@ aun .
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ demann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not have a good job , without farmer and country women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also for Peter White it was fixed : &quot; best food is produced here . &quot;
state Regional Land@@ scape ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg , the state subsi@@ dies of wel@@ f@@ ences .
the goal is to preserve the Black Forest .
the presence of a subsi@@ dy received by the L@@ PR is the requirement .
in addition , the fenced area cannot be bad ( hang@@ ar above 35 percent ) and must thus be threatened by re@@ aff@@ o@@ rest@@ ation .
the application of eight participants with 24 plots is currently running for the fishing calendar year 2018 which would like to build roughly 16 kilometres of fence .
the disclos@@ ure area is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
it is the saf@@ est sign of a regime change , when it start to attack statues .
Americans highly appreciate it like any other - therefore the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the company &apos;s company in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the keys @-@ ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump @-@ regime , certainly knew what he did when he did a symbolic &apos; ax@@ e in a heated battle with Jim A@@ cost@@ a from CNN &apos;s proposals on the dra@@ stic way of migration to the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ ath@@ ery and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ers would have suffered him when he had done it .
but he gra@@ b@@ bed its importance , and in particular the importance of being attributed as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base was added .
as Miller A@@ cost@@ a test@@ ified , &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... an American freedom which shines the world .
the poem , which you refer to , was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is basically right , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about the contemp@@ or@@ ating words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state invites not only an old immigrants , but the arms of the poor : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your rub@@ b@@ ish , your arms , and your pressed masses , which are longing to breathe freely ; / the gri@@ ev@@ ing of your weal@@ thy co@@ asts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drow@@ ning refuse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in the USA .
this conflict on the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who tried to place their words after her death at the base , knew very well that it was a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the links between French and American Republi@@ can ism by showing the feminine em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and they are themselves a very different name : mother of ex@@ ams .
the link of the link with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people wanted to change from the right wing this long .
the large writer Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is that the American flame will bring to the murdered world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it should bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not shine through the United States . &quot;
this is quite unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh can be found here .
the importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the stand@@ point of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was in it to see them as they were of the exhausted , el@@ dest , but hop@@ eful people after long and often aw@@ ful journeys on the deck of ships was seen .
it is the true sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and this is of course not the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump ever wish to recognize .
their tor@@ ch should not shine forth the way , but hat@@ red , which is their only source of power , ign@@ ite .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ unges Scottish members of the team from Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members at a time when only two vill@@ i belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ man Scottish quot@@ a of world champion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London in 2017 , starting on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is something special in Scotland , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand and we will continue , till we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I speak with people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they did . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the guy at the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidate , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ler - who are competing against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected captain of the team .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest .
their captain speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a series of athletes , whether they were Scottish , or whatever they live or practice , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought quite naturally , was great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Common@@ wealth silver medal winner , which will compete in its fifth world championships , says that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incredible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British squ@@ ad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the best total number of athletes in the world championship were seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Middle East Mu@@ ir &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; goes on this road and last year has five British and two European rec@@ itals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5000 m of runners .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man who was looking for a great season with the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the 30th Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members their first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ s@@ man on Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the club captain says that they are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the fact that many of their country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also with medals and fin@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be so special because of the team captain &apos;s capit@@ alists , it is because it was a great honour from the other members of the team , but to know that my team @-@ mates voted for me , and voted for something special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the sh@@ all@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to go on po@@ di@@ ums .
what concerns my speech as captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship .
it is therefore really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are back in the Olympic stadium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block articles on Facebook : do not work for a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the heat of voters
the father of our country knew something from a bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of all , from Dom@@ estic Policy up to his political principles .
he was uns@@ at@@ edly at cr@@ iti@@ que , safe .
but he did not have his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The freedom of freedom can be taken away - and , dum@@ b and dum@@ b we will be led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mar@@ yland to Governor Larry H@@ ogan , who has to work on it , more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ an employees have blocked and delete contributions of at least 450 people and expressed their opinion on its official Facebook page .
this is why the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union def@@ endants him in the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff called the law@@ suit as fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online commentary was full of a counter response with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it &apos;s especially important if there is a type like H@@ ogan .
this is a rep@@ ubli@@ can governor in a overwhelming democratic state , which is amaz@@ ingly popular .
it has the second highest acceptance of the 50 govern@@ ors in the nation .
H@@ ogan is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary stimul@@ ating head .
he has a fixed hand on the leadership of his state and strict observ@@ ance of the principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to join his voters and make his ha@@ ired head to chemotherapy in his side .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the block@@ age of persons who come to the Governor &apos;s page - which is considered officially &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the public forum &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary , and ultimately dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ an &apos;s spokesperson on Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse did not argue the actions of the governor and argu@@ ed that the comments of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of tro@@ ll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ing or h@@ asser@@ ted people who vibr@@ ate online the wh@@ ip .
the post spoke with some of the real people who have been blocked by H@@ ogan .
and they are just real people who speak with their leaders , a teacher , a business@@ man and a pastor , no tro@@ ll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respec@@ t@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful , and not prof@@ ane .
the pastor gave the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ an &apos;s Catholic faith .
Law@@ yer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , MD , was not filled with water but she asked for ass@@ aul@@ ting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented polit@@ ely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the comment field of the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not appreciate this idea , if a number of people abuse on the same topic , then they are mis@@ used as a so @-@ called collective action , and was not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what employees in the governor as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated Spam @-@ attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ ce@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to add a message by blocking one critic or deleted a negative comment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much cleaner than in previous years , if one had done the same thing , employees were sent to gather newspapers with critical core articles and to burn and burn protest@@ ers or to silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that just happens digital .
H@@ ogan is not the first public official that critic@@ ises that he has critic@@ ised Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feeds .
one of the first milest@@ ones in this question fell in Virginia last week .
the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County put together the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to U.S. District Jud@@ ge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they put a voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ an ( R ) received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U due to its use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so heavy .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect to the Internet .
the number of newspapers precip@@ it@@ ated between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous mail@@ outs hit his lead .
and even then Washington had anonymous tro@@ ll@@ s .
people who used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ or@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers , the Washington &apos;s decisions .
pet@@ itions that critic@@ ized his position on the contract of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his position , according to historical documents which were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he did not give her to silence .
freedom of opinion , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty is hoping for home comfort in the Renaissance Club
former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort in the next three days , since the Renaissance Club in East Loth@@ ian is holding the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who lost links till the final year in the next year , before he lost to Paul E@@ ales , is linked to the new venue as tournament tables in the name of the Club &apos;s founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieves his fame with this event , &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerry made a great job when he made this place .
he is an e@@ ager supp@@ orter of this game and is proud of his achievement here .
this is a great show@@ case for that course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a master@@ y for the first time in his 32 @-@ year career in both European Tour and the European Challenge tour .
&quot; this really feels great , &quot; said the player in South@@ port .
&quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since it was in the year after I had won them out of the program .
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special to me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year to win here .
it was a really special time and one we always appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who returned to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday this year , returns to the action on their home .
this event will be his first Scottish career since the Aber@@ de@@ en Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little more if you play at home , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you feel this extra pressure too .
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m glad about how it is gone . &quot;
with the trio in the field , the former Masters @-@ winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark McN@@ ally .

less lung cancer through pas@@ siv@@ ly
in the past two decades fewer people have died of passive smoking in the lung cancer .
scientists from the University Medical Center Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) came to this result in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are attributed to pas@@ siv@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said studies of Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he moved his own study to this topic in 1994 .
then there have been 400 succ@@ essive lung cases because of pas@@ siv@@ ity per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove themselves very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Street is in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are reason@@ ably back in time &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the head of the building Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house connections , the location is more complicated than susp@@ ect , because the ground is a lot below that is not noted in the plans .
the traffic , which has always been hin@@ dered by the construction works , represents a major problem for the construction work of St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignor@@ ance of the drivers from red lights and gate faces is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mr. Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses are entitled to passage .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working with the work for weeks .
&quot; the hot days were quite tough .
but fortunately we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with bold mineral water , &quot; explains Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cooked the dinner , she uses no stove .
they even use a pot .
in her wood house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai government in Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife is usually called a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - right in the chim@@ ney .
after half an hour the glu@@ ed b@@ olls with ins@@ ult , un@@ washed hands are taken and dev@@ oured .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also ex@@ ams her daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
the youngest of her husband &apos;s four married wives , their fields were assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is usual here .
of course it can be too late to work : most vill@@ agers are jo@@ bless , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to move around after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the life of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony taken in Indonesia in 1969 , when a controversial referendum was found in Indonesia as a member of only 1.0@@ 26 elders to vote against the occupation troops .
an existing movement which def@@ aults for independence from the Dutch rule , turned quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and foreign journalists or legal enh@@ ancements .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , including the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea as the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is deser@@ ted . the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 hour drive with the rental car .
there is no public transport .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo forests , and made from corrugated roofs that were converted by rust in different yellow @-@ brown sounds .
only very few Indones@@ ians have made their journey here , because journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian Mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans took a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and indicates their lively , handmade tur@@ ban , its dark shirts and their bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we only had leaves to our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s p@@ oo@@ rest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst children &apos;s mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold country .
the largest and most profitable gold mine of the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a land province of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort gained a value of 3.1 billion US dollars and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua more than wood resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these riches , however , are a source of mis@@ ery for Pap@@ ua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s authorization forces preserve a initial presence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an investigation from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort had paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 , among them up to $ 15@@ 0,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anic demands on greater autonomy threat@@ ens this golden g@@ ans and are treated mer@@ c@@ il@@ ess .
according to activists , more than 500.000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped by the Indonesian military since 1969 , tor@@ tured and imprisoned .
mass@@ acres in Pap@@ u@@ as tri@@ bal in 1970 @-@ s have been appointed for genocide according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful protest@@ ers in the past year alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are becoming Every@@ thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report of the arch@@ di@@ ocese of Brisbane , published in the year 2016 , in the reports of atro@@ cities and torture - ra@@ pe and electrical charges are especially popular according to another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week events occur , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia expl@@ orer for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources present a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is to 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development is changing , as Muslim economic activity come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the migrants began to sell chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ ua , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ be@@ th You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local who moved to the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it has cost the native pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; from Pap@@ ua to their market . &quot;
Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ov@@ i , in 2014 , spoke about ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua in 2014 .
the former Zimmermann took 27 of the 29 district of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presi@@ dential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua less changed , and today the natives feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the anticip@@ ation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a deep point only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two ind@@ ones@@ ian soldiers broke out on a motorbike through the darkness .
the fri@@ ghten@@ ed children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took the impulse to her sound , and came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who had drunk , pursued , and killed the group with their rif@@ le , saying , victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired in the group of children .
a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was struck as hard as he fell into the coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command centre to challenge justice .
they carried out cerem@@ on@@ ial hunting bows and led the orph@@ an@@ ita dance - in the circle and a bird @-@ singing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators began to tow the stones to police and military posts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the atmosphere was heated , a command was sent over an internal wireless : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the masses had to resist over three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in an official TIM@@ E document that has not been released to the local media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ four from En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threat@@ ening danger and called for rest and urged the crowd to return home .
no one was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , suddenly I was shot in my left hand wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the porch of his colorful wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame doesn &apos;t still know who has fired , but says that the sphere from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here came .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native Man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was met three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the witness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to be sure that he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who carries out as many Indones@@ ians , carries the TIM@@ E in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure their station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they are being attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people are dro@@ pping to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ list@@ i@@ yo , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many injured .
the news on the k@@ ill@@ ings came first on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; after Jak@@ arta .
three weeks Jok@@ ov@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate speech in which he utter@@ ed sympathy for families of victims and sw@@ ath to tackle historical ri@@ ots in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; I want this case resolved promptly , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said .
security minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he establish an extra@@ judi@@ cial mechanism to supplement historical human rights violations .
but the words started immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries occ@@ ured for a long time .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed to tackle these violations , but there are processes that need to go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to TIM@@ E on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is legally regulated &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wir@@ anto , having accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations have already been settled in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai pre@@ diction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fierce dis@@ believers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear for years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the bodies , the military sought after me , &quot; he says .
the sh@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police launched the vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confron@@ tation between vill@@ agers and the Manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a more un@@ conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , which was drow@@ ned when he was drow@@ ned in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
the representative inhabitants of the village were protest@@ ing in front of the company &apos;s site .
the police said that the vill@@ agers had driven stones on officers , re@@ acted by fir@@ ing warning shots .
but native people say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killing one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who was living near the hospital and witnessed how the injured one came quickly , the TIM@@ E . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament had called to draw the participating officers to draw and withdraw the police Brigade of the police .
Pan@@ i@@ ai has always been an un@@ ru@@ dent for the Indonesian government .
lack of sen@@ sel@@ ess development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction of the parent , Mon@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army that claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by meeting spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders are from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ oya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years and were randomly arrested , under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure national so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a &quot; tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potato products .
they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of not@@ a were only 10,000 ind@@ ones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived at the opening of new flight routes to the Nab@@ ire Airport in greater numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the few jobs that are in the region go to the better trained and weal@@ thy migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua seldom have the capital or the necessary skills to competitive its own company .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation is the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported , due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to films .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign to promote the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development was not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report the nor@@ theastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and Western pap@@ ua as follows : visa ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in one explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , six pac@@ ific states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ islands and the Salom@@ ons Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investig@@ ate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have histor@@ ically been supporting the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a Nas@@ ir showed the acc@@ us@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there is free media , so it is difficult to forgive the evidence of human rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who want to know more foreign governments to inform them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right @-@ ambassador , Ke@@ es Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura broke their silence and urged him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We want freedom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a source that also participated in the session but anon@@ ym@@ ously want to remain anonymous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Indonesia has another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua tells us that they probably won &apos;t be back for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Mountains , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Board of Directors .
he wants that Jok@@ ov@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people know that it is living under the constant threat of a peas@@ ant military who is in poor education and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , have to look at her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blame &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they only want justice , &quot; he says .
in spite of threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation , families of Pan@@ i@@ ai woman offered a last symbolic act of the Trot@@ z : the bodies of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station .
they know they might have never been justice to them , but at least they will not forget the responsible persons .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with lowered head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers from Dubai to the second time
a fire was found on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of residents to flee from 3@@ 37 metres high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fir@@ ing , which is swe@@ pt away in just two years by the sky@@ scra@@ per , that is the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries , and no direct word was given the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the cry of the people .
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50th floor down , &quot; a person told his name as George An@@ ger , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that units of fire fighting at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 a.m. GMT ) broke the fire and cooled down the building .
the government said she was working on providing accommodation for the suffer@@ ers .
the incident can be used to revi@@ ve materials , which are used in outer areas of high @-@ rise buildings throughout the world .
a study due to the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 found that the biggest part of damages from dis@@ covering , the exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or isolation , came .
in Great Britain the police said she believes that the system of plates for the isolation and covering at London &apos;s gr@@ en@@ ch tower could have contributed in June to the rapid spread of a fire , with about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , this sport revolutionary proposal was supported for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single was supported only to two sets , which are not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
indeed , the often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ set classic will remain in the traditional competition .
therefore , 6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of the member countries voted to reform the goal of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty just barely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members will not have adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historic con@@ tests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work on it , to improve the applications .
not until the vote , the proposal before many claims dealt with the final on a neutral place .
new from 2018 , only compar@@ atively small details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will soon have the host @-@ right in the first round of the year .
to reduce the cost of organis@@ ers , the requirements in training places , etc . , and players will have to complete the more official media dates before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US trav@@ eler gets connected objects into the plane , finding out a survey
a survey of passengers carried out that more than 20 per cent aware or un@@ consci@@ ously forbidden items in the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which entered the plane while they were acci@@ dentally forbidden knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed , they had discovered that they had travelled by fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey with more than 1,000 persons - performed by a Jet @-@ charter service , Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also certain that younger trav@@ ellers were more mis@@ used to respect the rules .
of the respon@@ dents , the enco@@ res that they might have been trying to fly with something that was banned from the T@@ SA was 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the Generation X were .
the most common items that were inten@@ tionally buried on T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent sur@@ rendered to have borne items with blades by the security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of male surveys have also confirmed that they had deliber@@ ately forbidden drugs onto the aircraft .
the company said it was question@@ ed about trav@@ ellers all over the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling via the airport reliability and how many things were deliber@@ ately done .
it is no surprise that people who wear the most frequently mu@@ g@@ gling - wis@@ s@@ ally or un@@ wis@@ s@@ ingly - by the safety ones who were most frequently flying .
the company however points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often in@@ secure which liquids may take them or how much is it .
so , there is no surprise that the largest amount of items forbidden by T@@ SA are forbidden .
for a time , the people thought the T@@ SA could see books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys a huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla Model 3 .
until now , he has signed that a part of the customers has already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservations .
alongside the always triumph@@ al numbers , Tesla &apos;s CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k have revealed a different , less gl@@ itter@@ y number after the announcement of the recent quarters of quar@@ terly report : the cancellations made for the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k frequently had recru@@ ited more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car in recent months , whose delivery is currently starting .
now Mus@@ k takes up : of the total 5@@ 18@@ .000 pre @-@ orders , 63@@ .000 have already been with@@ drawn again .
critics have always advised that it is only for non @-@ binding reservations .
in a case of cancellation , Tesla has paid the 1000 Euro ( 1000 pounds ) dollars in the US ( 1000 pounds ) .
at present , 45@@ 5,000 boast of such non @-@ binding reservations , Sp@@ k found in a telephone conference with anal@@ ysts .
however , the Tesla boss would not believe that the cancellation of up to twelve percent of all orders could be solved to date .
its argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production page .
in the past year , Tesla has delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 it is supposed to be - all models combined - 500.000 its , 2020 one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , we currently use 1800 reservations per day .
those who already ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; can be expected at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla creates its brand new , never previously tested production lines without any major inter@@ ru@@ ptions with maximum load .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to greater delays , then the infin@@ ity of reservations could be related to the problem for Tesla .
because the company can not prevent un@@ satisfied customers to run away in dro@@ ves .
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt asks for emissions of Obama @-@ Er@@ a for the reduction of emissions
one day , after being accused of 15 countries , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , CEO of the Environment Agency , resumed his former decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smooth air poll@@ ut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , as its agency proved to be the needs of government environmental authorities to be more respon@@ sive as existing administ@@ rations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit against his prior job in a federal court .
it is a deadline that ran on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 o@@ zone standards for ground @-@ up o@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will give compliance a year to give the plan to study more time to avoid the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change in local decisions or hin@@ dering the economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , prior to his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump , of Oklahoma , was a long time to become a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental protection regulations .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed , to block or delay regul@@ ators , which refu@@ te the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
the recent revers@@ al of Wednesday is the youngest legal set@@ back for the guarantee of the regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a federal court in Washington has decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded its authority as he was trying to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas vent@@ ures for monitoring and reducing meth@@ ane le@@ cks .
in a position published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ al at O@@ zone standards just struck the read@@ iness of EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of seas@@ onable ful@@ fill@@ ment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in previous administ@@ rations , the EPA often have maintained the dead@@ lines for conducting groups and to be accused of carrying out activists and others , and in an agreement an appointment for the implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt who lost the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in government regulation , and we take dead@@ lines seriously .
we also take the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the opinion of the EPA that P@@ ru@@ itt had to use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to make sure the provisions are based on a solid politics and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ can Congress is pushing for a comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone code .
a bill approved in the last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure has not yet been set to be set up in the Senate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the New York @-@ General At@@ tor@@ ney General , directed by the coalition of states that test@@ i@@ fies the EPA in this week , said the Group to su@@ stain the legal pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans that are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said For@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York included in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massach@@ usetts , Minnes@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ cia , Rhode Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil @-@ o@@ zone arises when harmful substances from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respir@@ atory problems , and contribute to thousands of premature death cases each year .
the representative of public health care and the environmental protection made a surprising course change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is distur@@ bing how much pressure does it need to breathe this reasonable step of responsibility for the protection of the air that we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ ori Ann Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to fight against the ide@@ ological Crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump @-@ government strug@@ gling to tackle environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
750 years St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Berg@@ kirche the old cemetery @-@ area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , July 16th at 16.@@ 30 .
whether his idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth benefit @-@ ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of tum@@ ours .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ n small gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Wu@@ er@@ ttemberg Ur@@ customer for the first time : count Hermann of Sul@@ z and the Vog@@ t &quot; on Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the wording of the document , on the Tum@@ linger Berg , beside the former parish church there was also a royal court that belonged to the church or the patron law , not vice versa .
there were also people there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as from the description of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 1858 , in addition to the sub@@ village and the Ober@@ dorf , which today in the village of Tum@@ bl@@ lingen are still visible , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mountain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the third one of the village coun@@ cill@@ ors in the village . &quot; &quot; &quot;
old maps from the period around the year 1600 under@@ lines these historical events .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ recht originated from the early medieval Eig@@ enk@@ ir@@ chen@@ recht .
a gent@@ leman who had built a church , continued with a pastor , remained the owner of this Church , and could also inherit it .
thus the right to use a pastor or to propos@@ e the bishop a new pastor .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the bigger one of them broke at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell was then lost in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows of the windows were scra@@ pped and the bells were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aky .
in 17@@ 96 the French troops came to the vicinity of the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used it as fire@@ wood .
rem@@ n@@ ants of the church threatened to fall in 1809 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from the list@@ ener .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us church was demolished .
only the church tower was stopped .
in the New Year of 18@@ 34 a storm arose the church tower and half it crashed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demolished .
only the existing tower @-@ value still remained as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em is taking the Hil@@ arius facility as successor to Dieter Dock@@ horn .
as organizer invite the friends and supporters of Tum@@ liner on Sunday , July 16 , for the sixth month of Ser@@ en@@ ade to the old cemetery in St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the com@@ bo of the Kepler High School and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Reinhold Mat@@ te@@ is .
local standing Hartmut Rom@@ ann talks the final word .
the program starts at 16.@@ 30 .
admission is available from 15.@@ 30 a.m .
the trunk of the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to forest , &quot; the organiz@@ ers set out the fantastic view .
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organis@@ ers look forward to many supporters for receiving the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant which is important for tum@@ ours and list@@ eners .
the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ ro@@ gens feel particularly committed to home @-@ care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade Organ@@ iz@@ ers Walter Mart@@ ini affir@@ med .
Association wants to test authorization of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bo@@ ish@@ eim does not notice any legal requirement for construction and therefore is addressed to the Council of land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim stretches back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been asked to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer n@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen , only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal there exists a wind force concentration zone .
construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration camp causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the other urban area .
such zones are to prevent &quot; savings in the landscape . &quot;
a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided to change a second wind power station in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but the Düsseldorf district government had not been authorized because of a form@@ work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning conditions , the granted approval of approval is still un@@ lawful and therefore re@@ trac@@ ted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of things : the City Council again decided to re@@ side the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; an approval by the regional government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; recommendation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the distribution of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded at this point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the so@@ lic@@ itation .
&quot; writing has been made to the circle since last week , &quot; declared a speaker .
the circuit takes her to the occasion , to test the matter again .
however , they do not mean that the procedure is stopped .
with a view on ongoing proceedings at the Administ@@ rative Court , the circle did not want to express itself regarding the argument of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area on the bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer n@@ ette of four 200 metres high wind turbines .
already in the past year , the company had engaged in which the city of Vier@@ sen is engaged in moderate contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households is to be covered - this corresponds to around one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ senior households .
the NEW Re will invest some 20 million euros .
in the past summer , there was green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg , Hein@@ sberg district .
car and Tra@@ ctor cra@@ w@@ ling : woman dies at terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident took place on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between low @-@ gel@@ ding and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn Circle ) .
a woman was hurt .
two more people were slightly injured .
the country road remained closed for hours .
according to police forces a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with their passenger cars accompanied her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying person the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and dealers plan &quot; homeland shopping &quot; weekend
Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a and people from the region will discover the shops in the city centre in September .
the business association and the municipal authorities want to use this weekend in the city centre on 8 and 9 September to enti@@ ce the inhabitants for shopping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the chairman of the trade , Christian King , announced the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weekend was to cultiv@@ ate its customers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which holds out their own town at the place of the usual supermarket . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is therefore a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market .
domestic companies will also present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips .
in addition , the shops are to shop the &quot; Mid@@ night shop &quot; shop .
the action does not only focus on inhabitants of the city and the local area .
in preparation , commerci@@ als in the radio , an internet video and printed bag that point to the action weekend , so Christian König .
municipal authorities and industrial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the business association and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attraction downtown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these include new offers , like the first &quot; Active Day , &quot; well @-@ sold Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ iring and host to move them to active participation .
attractive offers for Saturday and the negoti@@ ation of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential should be new or opened again .
these include spa and tourists .
but also many locals have lost the city center at shopping .
in the end , everyone should contribute to anim@@ ate the city center - up to rentals , factories of the whole city and clubs .
the people lack@@ ed to overcome the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y in a network that made itself well spread , had been told king in spring .
Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK Centre in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , told that five Thur@@ ing@@ ian towns will take part in the nationwide &quot; home @-@ shop &quot; day .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ sa , Weimar , S@@ ö@@ g@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should be more challenging to the est@@ e@@ em of local trade and make its significance to the common good for our cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the management of the I@@ HK and with many partners also make also clear that every citizen can affect its direct environment itself .

Tr@@ ump translated the tran@@ scri@@ bed tran@@ scription of phone call . Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of phone call between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were released by Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump on a phone call with the Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to , to listen to publicly that he would not pay for a planned wall of the boundary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. president gave him , because he had publicly den@@ ounced the Wall publicly . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This cannot tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and swear to pay Mexico for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first recru@@ it@@ ment with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ h@@ s , were also released and disclos@@ ed an ex@@ iled exchange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said that a trade for the US refugees who immig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was medi@@ ated by the government Obama would look like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr Turn@@ Bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most un@@ pleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford Mass@@ acre : activists lead to rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as an appeal for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury passed through a group of viewers in the rural Monroe , Georgia and he founded the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car that had four black passengers and a white driver , the bridge could reach the bridge , a group of white men with rif@@ les emerged to block his way .
the mo@@ vers of the bul@@ let - a man middle age in a hollow strip - took a long train on his cig@@ ar , looking out due to the wind@@ shield .
inside suspended the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; fr@@ aming the man .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ am torn off the silence , when a young black man was dist@@ orted by the passenger seat .
thank@@ fully , this terrible scene that was played on July 22nd , is only a reproduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if a sn@@ are thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all the audience enjoyed very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 Citi@@ zens move back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , to im@@ itate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Doro@@ thy Mal@@ com as well as George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey are cur@@ led by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever charged with murder .
&quot; it &apos;s really in@@ comprehen@@ sible that in all these years we have not been arrested , although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organization .
&quot; it is a shame on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former gres@@ s@@ man of the State of Georgia and a life of citizens .
for him , the post@@ ing serves as a dramatic call for action and introduces an annual commem@@ oration of the Monroe community that an in@@ justice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want to end , we want to heal ; but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to heal and recon@@ ciliation , until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bai@@ li@@ ze covers a blanket about the bodies of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files that were obtained from NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding county were suspected of appeal .
but nobody was ever charged .
although the susp@@ ects has been on the open foot for decades , citizens rights say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : Politics and sex .
in April 1946 , the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible to vote the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote in their vote in the summer .
at about the same time as the election , according to the FB@@ I , Roger Mal@@ col@@ m was based on a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ our was in the city , that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Doro@@ thy and that the baby she bore not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white country owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ col@@ m from prison , so the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Doro@@ thy and her cou@@ sins Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they came from prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge was approaching , a ly@@ n@@ mo@@ b ring@@ ed the car .
&quot; as it turns out , Harrison , who has prepared and arranged Mor@@ de , &quot; includes a FB@@ I report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local prosecution which had not only been involved in the murder , and removed the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was a stroke massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and if you vote , it will happen here . &quot;
during a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual demand of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is descri@@ p@@ tive , gri@@ pping and is based on a type of deep rac@@ ism , from which many believe he is no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and even harder to watch , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ age because we are then confron@@ ted with its skins in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen or listen to what I have done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors were pushed - a dozen White and the rest black - in a room and no@@ isy when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ positioned overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
he played the role of the Boss C@@ lan@@ mit@@ er for many years , but he said , never g@@ onna simpli@@ fy the role .
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to get this story alive , because we would not want to return to those days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ re@@ aw and Nick So@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ col@@ m and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester are playing their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ col@@ m , the H@@ ester and urged him , angry that he slept with his wife Doro@@ thy .
&quot; I said , &quot; He , wor@@ shi@@ ped from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona rest@@ ores the fire .
there is a break .
and then every one ( at least all the black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene is laughing at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still ch@@ uck@@ ling .
&quot; I just don &apos;t think white people at that time &apos; n &apos; he &apos; said &apos; .
&quot; but , &quot; I wit@@ ness@@ ing one of the other black per@@ formers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only need to make the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly this moves the energy in space , a feeling of camera . dis@@ comfort the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy making this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , if Ras@@ cona , says the N word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely nobody laughs .
this repeat ends violent and fast .
there are cri@@ es , nuts and then silence .
a woman clothed with a gri@@ pping dress , stands out on the bodies of the actor and introduces cheap Holidays &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot;
your voice is breaking the second word .
about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the show , many come down the street .
you have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as strongly about eight hours when Broo@@ ks it leads her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until this point , the Mor@@ de remains an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands on the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ se took place , the air feels sp@@ oo@@ ky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the last notes of the songs sound , Gre@@ ene invites you to inspect the crowd and inspect the body ame .
children so@@ cks in their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ ur a little boy , as if he wants to remember .
after a few minutes Gre@@ ens the crowd thanks - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch rope away and wi@@ pe her tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw surro@@ unds Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit which the C@@ lan@@ member has played .
Nick Ras@@ cona surro@@ unds two of his players and then breaks together in her arms , the emotional performance of the performance finally breaks out with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you did that for a reason . &quot;
later the audience sit together with the actors for dinner .
at a table ch@@ atting a white pair of Atlanta pictured above the reproduction with a black pair who just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words which cause the performance to leave .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these aw@@ ful words and deeds ... from people coming like yourself and do that as they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ age still continues , &quot; she added , &quot; today only police @-@ shooting is called . &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks court keeps on his table , he eats and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he had already begun to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reproduction is in a certain way inspiring , as it describes the hor@@ ror of what we bear , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s so if we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again .
he who does not study his own story , he does not know his own story , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ tter@@ d@@ ämmer@@ ung , &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wagner in Bayreuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s mon@@ umental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf is set on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e st@@ aging in front of gigantic , six @-@ storey setting .
the shooting stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a damaged street corner , including a Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from East @-@ Times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes car manufacturer par@@ ked in which the Rhine is po@@ orer than Rock@@ ers , or alternatively a is@@ etta .
stri@@ ped Oil lock@@ ers recall Cast@@ or@@ fs lad@@ y@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - that attracts by his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging .
the three Rhein@@ min@@ er - sung by Stephanie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wie@@ b@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ise just like already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; .
she disc@@ loses Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , cr@@ ush the Hollywood man@@ ier a body in the trunk and give the cra@@ ck@@ o Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the gorgeous magazine Hagen , which surro@@ unds the aura of a heavy @-@ weight bo@@ xer .
brutal the scene , when he bl@@ amed Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) has to believe in this turn .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who modest and bow their hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot;
big appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself first on stage - in view of the great heat back in Leg@@ erer .
the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team team had been awa@@ ited with tension .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , he had to leave a leading pipe concert on himself in 2013 , five years later , there were five years later in which the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BU@@ H &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; went down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been pleased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with cast@@ or , but it also has grown a understanding of its view .
I draw a positive conclusion .
max . works as Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er
they work in several places in their voluntary year .
where everywhere ?
amount : usually in Stein@@ furt in the furniture exchange , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the Furniture Bridge .
and I had already worked in the open day at school .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , broad spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with you@@ ths , with refugees , with young adults .
they are 26 years now , thus a late volunteer volunteer .
how does it come ?
so much : I did my S@@ LC .
and then a building engineer , let us say that successfully .
I recognized for me that it is wrong for me , and I want to do something different with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
make a social year , there is an insight , there one can see how it is on site , in the focal point , perhaps , really .
and was it like that ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social life in the winter semester .
I will study the mind , probably at the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , I &apos;m going to educ@@ ate a social worker and study in Ham@@ m at the Fachhochschule Erfurt .
is it not a bit unusual , while the volunteer can have several different locations ?
amount : yes , it is very variable .
it always comes to where you get the FS@@ J .
it is possible to work from ageing to youth work - in all sorts of fac@@ ets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also partially in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was exactly the right thing that has mat@@ ured me .
I could realise my own strengths and see how it really runs .
other than in building engineer ?
quantity : well , here it &apos;s not about to expect st@@ ati@@ ken .
one has always seen another man &apos;s head , each of which have a completely different history .
whether a refugee or a teen@@ ager who has been caught up out of the family - one must always agree on it .
very interesting .
and you had no touch of contact ?
amount : for this I am not the guy .
it is a realm that gives a lot .
a lot of love , lot of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is .
Pear@@ son kiss another 3,000 jobs and k@@ icks off the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the British Education Group Pear@@ son said on Friday , will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring program was started to overcome the pressure that the company is facing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to its previous restructuring , the General Director John Fall@@ on was mainly announced at the end of 2018 and from the beginning of 2019 , in addition to its previous restructuring , 4,000 points were lost .
Pear@@ son announced plans for a third cost reduction plan in May in a third cost reduction plan for a further 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast @-@ step of digital learning .
the company , in last month , expressed his participation in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House at the Partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann said that the outlook for the financial year remains unchanged , after the first half an increase of 1 percent to 2.0@@ 5 billion pounds had achieved .
con@@ voy &apos;s Attack of Kabul : NATO @-@ Sol@@ dier killed at suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital of Kabul , a soldier of Nato killed and several others hurt , saying .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter were injured , a declaration made by NATO .
un@@ confirmed local reports , according to the incident in Q@@ arab@@ ic region , three civilians were also died .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has taken this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed at a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ bed killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement by Nato , the explosion on Thursday evening was to happen when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement is said that all injured themselves are in a stable state and treated in the U.S. military hospital at Bag@@ ram &apos;s air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a major concern for NATO troops at the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of which in the capital .
at the end of July , a hom@@ icide car had killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kabul .
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the fatal Mil@@ it@@ ant attack in the country , since the Taliban kidn@@ apped in 2001 by the Taliban .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan because U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering expanding the number of U.S. troops to support the military and police in the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dents say that suicide bom@@ b@@ ates in Kabul in the last weeks a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policy and especially in the call of President Ash@@ raf G@@ hani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
EPA is a decision to delay the smo@@ g rule following complaints
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. environmental protection authority has a decision to delay the government regulation by Obama , confir@@ ming that the States are obliged to ban the Smo@@ g @-@ induced emissions . this took a day after 15 states accused the agency due to the stri@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to en@@ ligh@@ ten the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone provisions 2015 , &quot; and said they will show the duty of the agency to cooperate with states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in the dialogue with and about that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EPA @-@ boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone provisions , in which part of the country &apos;s poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions should be determined in order to maintain stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mainly democratic states , together with the municipality of Columbia , filed a call on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump tried to impos@@ e a wide range of environmental plans which the former president Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a bro@@ ader agenda , which is to boost growth econom@@ ies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of demo@@ c@@ rats and conservation groups that worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health .
the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; reduce lung function , and strengthen the respir@@ atory symptoms as such as asthma .
community wants common room
by the end , the decision was clear : in two mut@@ ually , the congregation on the community of Flu@@ ph@@ orn decides to set up a common room in the future cancer area .
in front of the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing part is signed , says mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ adas .
although it is still going to last , until now the church community has belonged to the church ownership , there is no plans for the project from a private investor to the st@@ em@@ bank@@ ment project .
for this there is a discussion on a common room .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor he would provide a living space of approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration and majority of the council proposes such a common room not as a meeting place for the inhabitants of sen@@ i@@ or@@ ously living space , but open into the church . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an example the word from the &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision will be decided by the provision of funds for the current budget proposed last fall , by funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is located in the refurb@@ ishment area .
the establishment of a common room would be as reported t@@ j@@ adas , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible .
the decision on the investor sees to sign@@ alize the investor that there is no b@@ ill@@ ets between the legs , giving him the conclusion that both artic@@ ulated - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which makes the tr@@ ition level and makes construction more economic - can be made possible .
unnecessary , meaning not only Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this supplement .
when it helps : unanim@@ ously , it doesn &apos;t happen .
not so easy to go with the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many own buildings , with whom you don &apos;t get so right now , for the common room out of the window , she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am making me hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is absolutely worth for the common room , but absolutely opposed to a communist participation .
it sees behind a conc@@ e@@ aled sub@@ jection to oh@@ mic property or even foreign investors .
this is not so , as with the purchase of the surface you don &apos;t give a supplement , but be a true contra@@ diction in doubt , the counter @-@ speech is in doubt .
if , Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s request submitted to the decision , there are three advoc@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with two counter@@ parts in the original program , Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ ises that : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do this decision , we make a huge step to close a gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; but it was not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believed in an increase in performance in the first official match of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great trust that my team shows that qualities .
the crew is ready .
we want to be intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is expecting a &quot; difficult , intensive game . &quot;

to w@@ ander in the resin of star
the first &quot; star path &quot; should be created in the Harz mountains .
this is planning the club ob@@ servatory Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planet is available in Göttingen , since 2003 .
a &quot; star path &quot; coming towards the information of many har@@ bours , he named it .
it connects nature , science , motion , and sports .
members want to place ads along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase by 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ quire St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Ho@@ he@@ ge@@ i@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tablets can be added to the internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection .
also acc@@ essibility is a crit@@ erion .
later , the Star@@ path train is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the Star@@ path , the audience experienced a lot of knowledge , for example , on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the society declared .
moreover , they learned why stars had different colors , or why one star was stronger than another , even though he is far away .
also , in which constellation is a selected star and when he is best to see .
the association has been operating since 2014 in the town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , which is the highest located ob@@ servatory in Northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office , in the middle of the Harz National Park , according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , one of the six dark regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ me@@ da galaxy is clearly visible with the naked eye .
in the university town , since 2003 , there is something similar to the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen , something similar to the star@@ base .
starting from Geb@@ h@@ y Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet leads up to Hain@@ berg and for ob@@ servatory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ at@@ erre@@ stri@@ al &quot; location in di@@ em@@ arden ( community of same ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
at the end point , the stel@@ a@@ es with the single planet - including the Zwerg@@ plan@@ ated degra@@ ded Plu@@ to at the end point - are exactly in the distance and a scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ unk either to a ball of 6.5 milli@@ metres in diameter while the sun reaches 70 cen@@ tim@@ eters away .
the entire distance from the planet is four kilometres .
while the light of sun up to the Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need an hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
so pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than light in the universe .
but the march to the next fixed line would last half a year .
Mi@@ key Garcia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss@@ ing a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Garcia was to set up in a coll@@ ision course to set the most exciting boxing fight in the near future among 147 Po@@ unds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN &apos;s offices in Los Angeles , up Garcia the un@@ defeated World Boxing Council &apos;s Ligh@@ tweight Design , the hall@@ way down to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Boxing organization Super @-@ weight champion .
after Gar@@ ci@@ as victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ zes on Saturday at Show@@ time both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Garcia was stretched out on the right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it to you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 19 o &apos;clock on ES@@ PN .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the pair posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is climate found that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; remembered Garcia .
&quot; I am risen for Bronze &#91; at 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big .
I am small for 140 .
I want to come back on lightweight .
and he has to move on a lightweight &#91; 135 pound &#93; and then we fight .
these are asking for the fans .
let &apos;s give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko lodged there .
&quot; boxing needs this battle . &quot;
climate was asked whether it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year to make an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell for their lightweight title contest in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle might take place at the Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Garcia and pressed himself out to fight against the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
when are they ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Garcia spoke , he admi@@ red Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fight &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may possibly take part in his Saturday struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held his praise for Garcia in the generous praise for Garcia in a generous praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to do the co @-@ off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Garcia said that focus was to show impact strength , then boxing .
they both said , they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that needs to be performed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and excitement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Garcia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; I waited for the top fighter and this is Mi@@ key .
it will be a great struggle . &quot;
four injured after tyre s@@ alt@@ z
on Thursday afternoon , four people were injured during an accident on the A7 .
after first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira dropped from 16.@@ 30 to the end of the termination point , probably after a tyre @-@ mounted drive over his vehicle .
the car stri@@ pped to the right into the ar@@ ches , where he ski@@ pped and then lying on the roof in the gr@@ unt .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the past by the rescue service A7 toward the north for approximately one hour was closed , subsequently the traffic could be settled on the left strip at the accident site .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; tri@@ pping chain works better &quot;
after 2 : 2 for the season open@@ er in Braunschweig , Andre Hoffmann hopes that optim@@ isation of the defense report will be released into Au@@ e points .
with the first match of the season Andre Hoffmann was happy with the result , since not the two opponents were at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were two opponents too much , and we have to be able to fit in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ensive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge the thresh@@ ing chain should be further optimized .
and a gate after a free shot , the Fort@@ unas ought to catch no more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be so no more besides Michael &apos;s ( R@@ ensing ) to the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team has even better found its experience in preparation with the triple @-@ chain as with the chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is his cause safe , &quot; because we have just finished the triple string to the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is , however , that we harmon@@ ize even better and we don &apos;t afford such a lot of play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can start a mis@@ lead by a mis@@ ery start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could well be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we are able to focus on Sunday with four points and we will be able to concentrate on the cup , we will surely be able to speak of a good season open@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about that his trainer had not wanted to know .
&quot; the start into the season I &apos;m only after six to eight playing days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who would not speak of an advantage over au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to a temp@@ est .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that the players from Au@@ e might even be something more fresh as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and full game like Fort@@ una for a lot of fun in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but they do not know that 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; says the inner def@@ ending of Fort@@ una .
surely , guests from the Rhin@@ eland as a little favorite go to the meeting in the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we are going away , only because we have the right to come under the first six is non@@ sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with just a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga which one must hit from the out@@ set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Fort@@ una H@@ coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so , Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum application tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested person are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( hard disk ) has begun with the implementation of the tests last year .
they should be more accurate during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish mig@@ rations agency ( Mig@@ r@@ ational At@@ trac@@ ts ) was critic@@ ised because of errors in the evaluation of the correct age of some refugees .
until today , migration of 6.@@ 880 was sent to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests of the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency shared that the person &quot; was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; may &quot; be less than 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is question@@ ed .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson , the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constant over the past few months .
&quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly consistent , &quot; he said the magazine The Local .
the high proportion of cases , in which the person was judged as above 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers have lied on his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that it was 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the person was 18 years old or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bl@@ adet susp@@ ects the 5@@ 81 results , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said that they become 18 years old .
the method of medical age assessment , made in x @-@ rays of fashion teeth and MRI shooting of joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ized in some areas .
a ske@@ p@@ ist is the end@@ o@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska institute , whose work en@@ comp@@ asses the evaluation of biological maturity of people to see if it was formerly used or later by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I do not think the type of measurement should be used .
jud@@ ging by biological age to this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say it safely , we should not do so as if we could do it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson , of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , def@@ ends the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , you can say the risk of assess a child as an adult is low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is close to 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the work on the three bridges on the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven tons of heavy emphasis on the bridge was installed on the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it is going super , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reinhold Lei@@ cht , Head of the Department of road and Traffic in the State of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during April , work began at the same time at all three refurb@@ ishment bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and is sure to keep track of the schedule .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in the year 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure the stability and safety of traffic , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge on the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tonnes heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on Wednesday morning .
this is an edge @-@ mount , which is also used as operating distance .
on Friday a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap should be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is supposed to walk .
the particular one is , that it concerns finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tips has the laying of lines through the building work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass fibre cable attached to many companies .
local residents were informed on the project in advance of the work .
fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished at first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the bridges between the building building and the collector in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg the traffic is regulated through a traffic light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the construction on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach city entrance the street is closed in the area of the bridge at the height of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three bridges amount to 700 000 Euro .
the whole is financed by the country .
AF@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : bear in protest at German potato sal@@ at
it is not so frequent that parties will pull together on one strand , but when it comes to an alternative for Germany ( AF@@ D ) , what else is difficult to get under a hat .
the parties represented in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag volcan@@ oes ( CDU , SPD , green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , lin@@ ke ) belong to a broad alliance that goes on this day peaceful flag as the AF@@ D invites to the poster of a big campaign in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle .
and known names of the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ di will form the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are in front of the event before the event are not w@@ anting to listen to AF@@ D developers , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel is colourful . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; originally the city @-@ picnic was planned under the slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All on a table &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the fountain site , but now is located on the parking lot below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who are coming to the AF@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , President of the Forum A world and one of the decisive organis@@ ers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; original potato sal@@ at that could also eat the AF@@ D without problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him .
the police have ordered many officials after Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing the presence mainly at the train station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the AF@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ ily reported from the AF@@ D volcan@@ oes , he tries to make such an event and received the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked at first in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already rebuilt Lau@@ ren@@ ti@@ us kir@@ ch not enough parking spaces available .
so now the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ e is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with views of the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the good right of the people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is also doing it : at about 20 o &apos;clock the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz takes care of a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ Palat@@ inate AF@@ D president Uwe boy .
in the hall , approximately 200 list@@ eners , who are waiting for the general election of the German elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice @-@ President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch hold her spe@@ e@@ ches .
the police presence - but so far , the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than one hour the AF@@ D @-@ event , the guests at the front , have a longer breath , but there is also a little place there after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can bring back - no particular appe@@ als .

a hearing with the Wolf@@ enb@@ acher Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is in the series of Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ concer@@ te tomorrow , Sunday , at 20 o &apos;clock in the convent church .
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pet@@ kov , he is a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea , &quot; or also &quot; Bal@@ can@@ fol@@ klore &quot; meets a classic German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in Europe &apos;s leading orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is with the renowned concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is a solo@@ ist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both united the desire to not only cross boundaries in their instruments , but also mer@@ ging the limits of different gen@@ res .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johann Sebastian Bach , with both the like in a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Welt@@ musik &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; sounds with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Jaz@@ ze@@ ch@@ op@@ re@@ ist@@ oc@@ rat N@@ ils W@@ ER , ming@@ le into classics , jazz and the free games to a fascinating world of art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this core of the programme was first performed in the spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ere has been specially written for the two musicians and more : the &quot; Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ kirche with their special acou@@ st@@ ics is consci@@ ously involved in the concert with their special acou@@ st@@ ics .
Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about their Bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life .
but I would like to try everything , &quot; so Kri@@ sten Stewart is quite frank@@ ly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I bite in grilled cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that &apos;s cool , what comes next ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the best known companion of the Hollywood star was to her &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; Robert Patt@@ inson &apos;s &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; that ultimately became bitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine is in love with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in love with love which I had been updated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you think I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten was that they had bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and believed the du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never been confused or imp@@ aired .
I never liked it , not taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially those suffered them according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the school age as they preferred to be like a bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven , my children , I would look like a Bu@@ b .
I felt really attacked , anxi@@ ous and und@@ am@@ aged .
now let &apos;s look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public they would not like to listen to their love life : &quot; people expect you to give yourself a certain way , and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like it to just@@ ify me all the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Virginia Governor of Virginia announces that he changes the party
the Democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening for a rally with President Tr@@ ump , that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the demo@@ c@@ rats are away from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and many refle@@ ctions ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you , if I am a democratic Governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in je@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a great announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic can@@ did@@ acy in Hillary Clinton .
justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mine in five states and inherited a coal store from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee commissioned a statement in which it said , &quot; The Party change from Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party that would rather hin@@ der us than working towards us to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Govern@@ ments and the control of the least legisl@@ ative bodies in history , the announcement of Governor @-@ Justice is only the last re@@ jection of a party left without leadership , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ NC @-@ chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel said in a declaration named C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for D@@ oping sc@@ andal
the worldwide chief of the athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised the Thursday that he described as an obvious exc@@ use from Russia to a D@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated , it was not the moment to be absorbed again in the sport .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in told during the IA@@ AF World Championships on the eve of the athle@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was accurate and that he had decided to fight D@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he told it , sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were caught in competitions gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress approved for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ supported D@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the Rep@@ orters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were delighted to have experienced the Russian Federation at itself having experienced some rather hot times and everything will do to ensure that the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he is also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accept the criteria for his re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day , and I think that progress was achieved , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force , that this was not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the principle always was that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ lets from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
n@@ inet@@ een Russian athletes will start at the athle@@ tics World Championships starting on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday in Russia to meet some of the criteria for a res@@ ent@@ ment .
the drug trials are still in@@ adequate and forbidden train@@ ers are still free , he said Rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
tragedy for in Mali have settled in Mali
at a fun@@ eral in Nord@@ h@@ ess@@ ische F@@ ritz@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two have been thought of a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt under high safety precau@@ tions .
to the still un@@ solved , Minister of Defence , Ursula from the Le@@ yen ( CDU ) said nothing .
they described the two inver@@ ted pilots but as &quot; C@@ ould of her Profession@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest victim , which they have done in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year old pole of Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week in West African Mali .
their cour@@ ge was transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a police station of the Bundes@@ wehr in the F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
at noon , only relatives took part in the church .
afterwards , the fun@@ eral in the family of family , eng@@ ul@@ ent friends , from representatives of the German Armed Forces and Politics began .
among them also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wie@@ ker .
the most appe@@ als placed on the side of the rose , and his arms were in arm in the arms .
in front of the church F@@ ritz@@ l@@ ée and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
Secretary of Defense of the Le@@ yen named the adjacent troops as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and broke into sat@@ anic .
the rod ten@@ er has built the flight operations of the fight screw@@ driver Tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger drivers of its regim@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ent which the soldiers belong , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not turn the crash , nobody would have imag@@ ined it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
doub@@ ts about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of Le@@ yen not : the deployment is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country , from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr made no data .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife .
this shared the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already employed a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the queen agreed with the decision of her husband , she promised to leave her in her communication .
where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , be still un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made it from this , that he was not happy with his title .
after the climb of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would like to become king .
in 2016 he retired and puts the title &quot; prin@@ c@@ eness &quot; as well .
since Hen@@ rik does not have the title and function that he wanted , he did not see himself as an equivalent opposite of his wife - as soon as death , LE@@ NE B@@ alle@@ by declar@@ es the leader of the Danish king house .
if the last resting place of the 83 year old will be finally , be un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to become buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years .
the born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French noble line@@ age , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked in the French Embassy in the River Th@@ ames .
during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik spoke to the people &apos;s sympath@@ ies to a heavy stand in his almost 50 years of government .
in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik said about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival all that I did was critic@@ ized .
my Danish was varied , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stockings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ idal , which I smo@@ ked in instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco , and who could be able to prove the brand of social intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed happy with this position and will not be ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants rapid re @-@ election
the CDU and F@@ DP in front of the possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defe@@ at@@ us Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is not willing to withdraw from the day after the loss of red @-@ green government majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and on Friday she spoke out for the dis@@ solution of the Parliament .
previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Green Party from their agricultural population in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover thus lost its pop @-@ up majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Green Party El@@ ke T@@ ests set up their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its const@@ itu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained in Hannover on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CDU @-@ leader of Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler would recommend his faction to record them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU and F@@ DP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Parliament , the SPD and the green 68 seats .
so far , the ratio was revers@@ ed .
the new Parliament will be elected regular on 14 January .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether they could continue to gover@@ n this situation without a majority .
however , Stephan Weil believes it is , however , that its self @-@ resolution should be dis@@ regarded as quickly as possible .
the CDU faction will probably decide on its way on Tuesday .
the state capture also sees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s Parliament cho@@ oses the trust and choose a successor .
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
these options must be legally tested unchanged , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will discuss all the questions in peace if they are legally examined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; West &apos;s step &quot; but a bit cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the polit@@ ician himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she called himself as a tag in black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the dep@@ uty de@@ pu@@ ties to return their land retreat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that she has received her land retreat , which she has received over the green country , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the National Chair of a Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said vice @-@ president of Green Anja PI@@ EL : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ west extra@@ ordin@@ arily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she deliber@@ ately decided not to lead an pron@@ unci@@ ation in the fra@@ ction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the background , there weren &apos;t any substantial differences , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD : elec@@ toral candidate , Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the impact of the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to the CDU as betra@@ y@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attitude of the former Green M@@ EPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ y@@ al to the voters , but also betra@@ y@@ al to Red @-@ Green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Council of Socialists and Democrats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , who quickly chose the Parliament .
the withdrawal of T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the policies of politicians &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their last desol@@ ation and in their frustr@@ ation their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ized SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CDU during Lower Saxony makes this dirty inc@@ iner@@ ation and tries to capit@@ alize political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
low @-@ president of the CDU , Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , wants to recommend to take care of El@@ ke T@@ ests into the CDU .
the SPD head of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw the life@@ jack@@ ets to f@@ ake the outcome of the country &apos;s elections in 2013 .
the CDU was then with the SPD its strongest power , SPD and Green had a very thin line of a voice in the land day .
agriculture of Agriculture in Interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gif@@ ts , Mr Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses about contam@@ inated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal be ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Secretary of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the German Editor Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and reply .
Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect yourself from poll@@ uted eggs ?
I can only encourage the consumer inside and consumers to review the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamped print .
the Federal Länder are presenting the latest information about the affected eggs on the website www.@@ grocery war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if according to everything we know , a health threat is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di takes over the best crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
the food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house immediately got up immediately and is in close contact with the authorities of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trading has the same way as the manufacturers ensure that the sold products are traffic and health are harmless .
if the decreased level of 0.0@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg has exceeded , these are not traffic .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consum@@ es .
this time they are not to blame .
manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
after the primitive knowledge the production plants meet no immediate gu@@ ilt .
rather , they must reck@@ on due to the alleged illegal pract@@ ition@@ ers of service firms with economic damages .
as always , there are too little controllers in the harvest .
is it not lacking in the personnel or also on the imm@@ utable jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls that have un@@ covered the operation .
in truth , however , food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why a consistent recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of such events and the hand@@ ing over the authority in cases where off@@ ences are present , of decisive significance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already made a lot of times , that I &apos;m expecting a comprehensive recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance by the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm mis@@ m really necessary in food sk@@ and@@ als ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and secure food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ des in food industry is used , consumer consumers are right to be right .
by these means , manufacturers , tra@@ ders and consumers are in a situation that are absolutely not necessary .
it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de fibr@@ ate in the attitude of food @-@ consuming animals is not acceptable and must be completed immediately .
this has to be consistent and worked with high pressure on all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from every competent authorities that the facts hold fast and comprehensive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the Foot@@ work of the Foot@@ ball on Ne@@ ym@@ ars move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b Ne@@ ym@@ ars World Record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA , for the leading organisation that monitors European game has power to forbi@@ d teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play rules , which were launched in 2011 by UEFA Cup , will mean that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer by Ne@@ ym@@ ar has been financed without large losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to purchase the Brazi@@ lians from his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ ym@@ ars to France .
PS@@ G can easily loose the money with security , so that Ne@@ ym@@ ar writes and bring him to a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the powers of rich ruler of Qatar .
publishers may apply a lot of money to purchase players , but have to control the break @-@ even point in their online @-@ related business with legitim@@ ate income sources .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEFA Champions in 2007 .
the former French player believed that Ver@@ eine who had enormous debts in their quest for achievement , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ru@@ in@@ ct , when banks or owner moved their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P focused on the debts of the clubs on the supervision of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the Roman Ab@@ ram@@ ov@@ ich , used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to build up the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er case .
the current three @-@ year @-@ old FF@@ P @-@ assessment period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can reduce losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini is fallen by the Presi@@ dency of the Un@@ gn@@ ade in 2015 , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to put off by excessive expenses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , opposite the Associated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a package , it may distribute the amount for accounting on the duration of his contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five @-@ year contract , allowing the amount of income for the next five years amounting to 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 , the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , has hit the most difficult sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million Euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to € 20 million - and it was arranged that the crew members for the Champions League of season 2014 / 15 was limited to 21 players instead of otherwise normal 25 players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UEFA is searching for clubs that could try to list their financial supervision by joining the company which is associated with the owners of a club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while a cat@@ ar@@ ish company , the PS@@ G is sponsor of the PS@@ G , if the value of the sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA Cup would not apply for legitim@@ ate in@@ comes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the level of the PSA sponsor@@ ing was pu@@ ffed up by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it has been reported that some of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar may come to Qatar by the organis@@ ational Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar estimate that Ne@@ ym@@ ar will be the World Cup amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors and could simply find out such a maneu@@ ver for the UEFA regul@@ ators .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UEFA is even more attentive to see each attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEFA had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G on Ne@@ ym@@ ars Transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anon@@ ym@@ ity with The Associated Press as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of € 54@@ 2.4 million for a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ ym@@ ars arrival a blessing for Sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot runs .
the association assumes that sales after the signing will rise by at least 30 percent .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ ym@@ ar &apos;s departure by claim@@ ing that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear event of &quot; funded D@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ars .
Arsenal @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American Sports Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the pre @-@ keeping of La League against a state owned by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the foot of the foot in the past 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect the finance fair Fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new vend@@ or supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate was produced for the Swiss .
now the commit@@ tees co @-@ operation before a possible end : the airline relies on the contract .
Swiss speaker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed the news agency S@@ DA an appropriate report of the newspaper &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; on request .
following the current planning , the airline will contract a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would check every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very happy with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson .
some 17 million small red scra@@ per boards of 14 gram spread each year before landing on the passengers .
the Swiss does not want to make any information about the cost .
industry in@@ sider estimate the order volume in accordance with &quot; Nord@@ west Switzerland &quot; at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves annual turnover of some billion Swiss francs .
but more import@@ antly , the advertising effect : for a chess manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
how many applicants are there to the new call , Swiss does not want to betra@@ y it .
but only Swiss manufacturers are coming into question .
according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the treaty by the spring of 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not reachable for a review .
since 2006 , Swiss chocolate @-@ boards spread on board their flights .
before Swiss bought a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has built in collaboration with Hu@@ g chocolate tablets .
the possibility to place the logo resulted in the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y two and a half years ago .
the airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ h@@ aul flights the customers of the First Class with delic@@ ac@@ ies of the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli become spoiled , in business class n@@ ags passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi of Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .

Nost@@ al@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repet@@ ition of history is at the same time nost@@ al@@ gic because of the glorious days of the 80 @-@ year @-@ old Gr@@ unge @-@ era ( as Vor@@ os@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV rot@@ ten ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d were to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ ody and a em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise , it feels like the time was close .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; did not work surprisingly well , not only because of its absur@@ dity ( it contained a original story for a speaking box vegetables , which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by b@@ ying on the core of the g@@ ags - actors middle age play hor@@ ny children who grow up - however , they made the im@@ possibility to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es back .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with its adults , which now play adults , is less emotional and his par@@ ody fits more according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gracious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has not yet forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another crazy about evil plot in which Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is included , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it makes a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ illons on sub@@ li@@ pp@@ le of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sing@@ les &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the moments of random mad@@ ness that could heat this fran@@ chise : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene is to show how to visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Amazon reminds of another kind of nost@@ al@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ low &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his East against @-@ West Ring@@ compete @-@ I@@ con@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is a gen@@ ius idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags for looking ( the police keeps the time to watch chess on television as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of the famous actors , including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Chlo@@ e Sev@@ ign@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a des@@ perate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer that carries a Re@@ agan M@@ ask - that it is often a single one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with six long episodes the com@@ edy draws off and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequently enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was reproduced on a smaller length , could see his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re better , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef again visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ oured one bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message for the imag@@ ined communist audience is that western culture can do everything to feed for a gel . &quot; &quot; &quot;

s@@ woo@@ p against Drugs @-@ Mafia in the Land
the police managed a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest @-@ B@@ aar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Constance , and Stuttgart , as the public pro@@ secutor Constance on Friday .
at the age of 25 , the accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued an arrest warrant against this .
in addition , officials reduced large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand euros .
at the same time , in Italy two persons were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
these two are believed to be shipped to Germany .
in the action , Italian and Bavarian inquiries were involved .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were in action .
the members of the Mafia was organised on drug criminal , heavy violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
in the summer of 2016 , the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office Const@@ ants comp@@ uted against the organized drug traff@@ icking in the southern German region .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors of Konstan@@ z and Palermo , there was an exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore the large use on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the visor of the exam@@ inations carried out the Italian national women with close relation to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia .
an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ started , where several shots were fired at an inn early in the morning should go to the bank@@ roll account .
fashion Indi@@ cted large g@@ aps in the fore@@ ig@@ ner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not show up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report the fore@@ ig@@ ner register in Germany has considerable defects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
the advoc@@ ate for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to large g@@ aps in the foreign country register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defects in the submitted data may result in the process of asylum procedures and dep@@ ort@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to partly grave mis@@ decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned in an analysis called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the regist@@ ers , data identified 10 million people with foreign nationality , including approximately 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 foreign agencies in Germany .
because the data has not been kept sufficiently , the data quality in parts of so far not been well maintained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who are no longer living in life , or by citizens who have become German citizens and are no longer emerging in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; faulty data additions , reverse processes may significantly slow down , &quot; says the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the statistics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reis@@ er@@ ci@@ fer@@ ous people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are recorded , this EU citizen should not have to come out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , such incorrect authorities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led to a dis@@ soci@@ able debate on how to deal with travelers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently began to return the refugee families with 16 @-@ year old children back to Italy if they were entered from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that go forth from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Apostolic Church &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the paper , the BAM@@ F thus says , the BAM@@ F will lead such procedures &quot; regarding families with children - except for infants and small children - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper was on the difficult situation in the reference to the difficult situation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Dublin agreement , the EU is responsible for refugees to reach first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a mig@@ rant continues to travel to another EU country , this state can send it back to immig@@ ration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the reason I write the office : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the admission capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has greatly increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy took off for the recording and accommodation of family guarantees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) , consider these assur@@ ances adequate .
other EU countries would also send refugees back in the context of the Dublin @-@ Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ized this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children threat@@ ening the conditions of suffering in the Italian Asyl@@ um System &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best results achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood found in Ober@@ chn@@ enbach was already provided for other people in the blood of blood .
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
together with Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now shared 50 litres of blood now with his 100 donations .
traditionally , the church in the meeting of the council cho@@ oses multiple read@@ iness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome as our body is created for it , and we are wit@@ ness@@ ing the don@@ keys of respect that their blood for strangers are still un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the round@@ wound leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the c@@ anned foods are de@@ composed into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , maize failed by the actions , which will be carried out in the spring of Upper Austria in spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we obtained the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the DRC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , I change the shift into the theatre house a few years ago to higher numbers .
before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Meta tran@@ scripts were awarded to the multi@@ fac@@ e@@ ws and were awarded for 50 suffered blood donations .

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to be announced later that interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have d@@ amped the spec@@ ulation over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contracts remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they retained the interest rates on family members in the middle of a intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s political decision makers ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank approved the Bank &apos;s monetary policy with 6 to 2 , to increase interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , because the weak economic growth had weak@@ ened the support for increased interest in this month .
in its quar@@ terly annual forecast , the Bank reduced its growth progn@@ osis for 2017 to 1.7 % and anticipated for 2018 on 1.6 % and anticipated that the pressure on the household income would continue , whereby the inflation is expected to rise to just under 3 % in the fall .
but it signals that in the next few years could be necessary to breed inflation in the next few years , and she said that the credit costs would have had to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the Mamm@@ ut economic package which was issued a year after the Bre@@ xit .
it will demand time for the financing plan to provide low financial resources for banks , although it is predicted that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the context of this system - at 115 billions Po@@ unds Sterling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as pressure on the reality will continue to sum up the sum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the interest rates it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tighten@@ ing of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for cooling down inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; extent be required than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets currently forecast the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank emphas@@ ized that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ph@@ ased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank forecast for this and next year &apos;s forecast for this and next year , compared with the 1.9 % forecast in May , rose to 1.7 % .
it has retained its growth progn@@ osis to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pounds fell against this news opposite the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
the decision to no change is coming , after the most disappoin@@ ting growth rate should have increased expectations to a rate of interest and the GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover by the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households who are affected by a rising inflation and small de@@ duction measures , because the exac@@ erb@@ ation becomes even worse before they become better then .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that the monetary policy in the next years cannot prevent the income gap &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages to the end of their thre@@ ep@@ rint &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clearly &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the weak pound , which is compens@@ ated by a proportion of lower consumer expenditure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision will come to a year after lower@@ ing interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in August after the sho@@ cking EU vote which caused the sin@@ king of the pounds .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will completely reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the last sentence of the Bank on interest rates , the call had increased after a rise of interest , because inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ th@@ ron@@ ged households with three political decision @-@ makers in July an increase to 0.5 % . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inflation declined in the last month of 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank predicted that this was expected to be put on again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the excess in relation to its goal of 2 % &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Co@@ rec@@ o mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; given the short retri@@ eval of the swap rate , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be competitive again because the l@@ ul@@ ators were looking for shops and want to finish the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly well for those who run the existing de@@ position and fin@@ alize the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National health service ) should rub@@ bed to 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; in September following a fight against the high @-@ court struggle against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS you will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trans@@ forming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV pre@@ ventive medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ positi@@ onal hem@@ or@@ proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high risk patients by around 86 percent , now comes from healthcare to a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he was willing to finance the trial , after the Appeals Court confirmed a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice in order to pay for the Pr@@ EP despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday announced by N@@ HS England @-@ CEO Simon Stev@@ ens , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ ghton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield are among the first to be made , and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced in England in April 2018 .
pre@@ positi@@ onal phy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV medicine used before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP was significantly reduced the HIV transmission in inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous areas .
prior to intercourse , Pr@@ EP means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medication can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
among those who come in question include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV positive partners who were not successfully treated successfully .
in clinics , suitable participants will identify the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be observed due to anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who live in England and registered in a family doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program is set at a £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the supply of the medicines in this week after an international competitive purchase .
the study aims to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by collecting clinical evidence how to target and implemented in a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stev@@ ens said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should extend the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to tackle HIV and over@@ take . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive for NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if it is specifically aimed at needy and endangered people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed trial in England will have to develop a new instrument that is truly custom@@ ised and not subject to a trial with a partner who leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of Ter@@ rence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority is now to be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one has left a risk for HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the Pr@@ EP @-@ Test@@ im@@ Medicine was made , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Hodg@@ son , shadow of Health Minister said : &quot; the start of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome and ob@@ sol@@ ete after months of reporting and delay .
evidence demonstr@@ atively that this drug may be as part of our approach to the HIV prevention and can end the transmission of these li@@ vable infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they contribute to a step closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrasse - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed his bags and sold it .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day . &quot;
since the first visit the 1,000 square foot was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a til@@ ted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezz@@ anine wanted to use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she authorized the architects and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed from Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill that had 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to life for yo@@ z@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over@@ l@@ apping , so that the architectural challenge in it was to create a mezz@@ anine in which one could stand .
it &apos;s needed to think creative to solve the def@@ ending .
&quot; the steel works is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so arrange that they were stacked together , without that we had to lose ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform but to put the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement allowed it to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezz@@ anine , a classic copper light window looks down through the glam@@ orous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in addition theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to make him any longer .
in the kitchen feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance we offer space for all squares and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen by the perception of a glam@@ orous space if it is not used .
kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little engineering art went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the st@@ ahl@@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s very important , so it is when you push the door up , very easy gli@@ ding . &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the footprint - or what your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ th@@ mental form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of soil . &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space and use high @-@ quality materials , which provide space to its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are things that you touch and help them create an emotional connection in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electrical outlets in the walls .
these are important but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform themselves by good design and increased square met@@ ering of some standard in something quite amazing .
indeed , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them .
Brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar store empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the Dy@@ nasty , in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate ads Victor@@ ias worth over $ 500 million .
the former Director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football @-@ Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors of his younger brother Paul . he has led him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and their assets should be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 list@@ ings worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family bought a business in 1973 by Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
the family West@@ co Je@@ ans founded and grew up to a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold in 1999 for $ 85 million .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is comprises offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento which apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with her late father Colin - from Paul is described as a &quot; main driver and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lut@@ is family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about a third .
a court file says that Colin has ownership of € 316 million and Paul valued at a value of 176 million dollars .
the allocation of real estate and cash has proved for Paul as proble@@ matic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new ideas designed by Colin proposed that which I kept for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed wor@@ ries .
the brothers are now strug@@ gling to control over the existing business - Colin , as Paul claims to be excluded .
Colin arg@@ ell@@ ar , this is not true , but th@@ rows Paul outside to manage some poss@@ essions .
in an early Mon@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was ten@@ dered by Colin , he says he wants to settle the battle .
&quot; my Turkish heritage says that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the event , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mail and reports from companies , among them Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck C@@ ram@@ er , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C and held from both sides .
Ms. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants from the late 1950 @-@ ies and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used to buy the security in order to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Lie@@ gen@@ stein , in Colin the first je@@ ans of the family .
Colin says that he began West@@ co as he &quot; in my last years the High School was when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hopes to ad@@ mit their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brothers to court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other Brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ is group , and Colin claims that Mark were paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company .
both Luke and Mark were , Paul &quot; says &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin has kept back very much , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire in 2015 , Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s best friend .
Fair@@ fax Media recorded in touch with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Colin responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can really say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to complain about and draw our family names through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to finish in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he was still hoping for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Colin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump is planning to restri@@ ct new Chief of Staff to restri@@ ct the media wi@@ in@@ ence of its President .
others have tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can do it .
if yes , he will be the first .
Polit@@ ico partner reports that the new staff of staff is planning to restri@@ ct the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of the news media - in hope to hold the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , on his first working day with Lead employee , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump White House who wants to repair himself : bad information that advised into the hands of the President .
Kelly said the worker , that information on him should flow - whether on paper or in post@@ ings - because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis make sense , but others have tried to t@@ aming tr@@ ump by monitor its media health .
president Tr@@ ump relationship invites for decades to come back - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the Tr@@ ump was upset because of an un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places that were to convince him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former voting advisor Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February of Polit@@ ico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ ump Twitter @-@ hab@@ it under control , according to six former voting rights , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tr@@ ump Twitter habits ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe this campaign officials should know something we don &apos;t know that Tr@@ ump Twe@@ ets have even included more ignition sources without their inter@@ ventions .
we will probably never learn anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump does not broadcast .
if his collabor@@ ators have done it several times to keep anger from him , their efforts were worth it .
but no one has consistently hin@@ dered it , that tr@@ ump control causes causes .
a part of the problem exists to put together people in a White House , which are competing for competing parties , and again attempt to present their own agenda by promoting Tr@@ ump Material , which possibly promotes his views of the world .
Polit@@ ico partner - which deals with this story - told in May about the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ors , to bring about doub@@ t@@ ful information to the President for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press c@@ utt@@ ings , especially with a corrupt le@@ aks , and to find out from where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when somebody charged a printed copy of an article from Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ alist Charles C. Johnson , who accused the altern@@ ate rod of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap &quot; from the White House .
although Johnson was ban@@ ished from Twitter for lack of Twitter or that he does not have any concrete evidence , or that he has vo@@ iced in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump reading the article and began to question his staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective managers than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his coun@@ sel@@ ors still strive for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make wa@@ it@@ ys mission very difficult .
Mei@@ er wanted crimin@@ als get Post of Europ@@ ol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population will pray and hop@@ ed .
the police in Europe sent postcards to dangerous crimin@@ als in this summer ( virtual ) postcards on the run .
since the addresses of the wanted protection are not known as a natur@@ alist , references from the population will be hop@@ ed and worship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europ@@ ol reported on Friday by the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experience had shown that many vol@@ at@@ ile in holiday destinations sought to hide from Europ@@ ol .
21 post@@ cards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries have been compiled .
the website www.@@ e@@ um has been available since 2016 , and has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online notes were arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to the publication of the publication on the website .
travelers negoti@@ ate over a tren@@ ch and return back to &apos; million@@ aires series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute travelers on the bar@@ ef@@ oot , which we had negoti@@ ated one from the municipality , to rec@@ laim a field in front of their manor house .
the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a weal@@ thy road of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aires series . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of transport , having been exposed only in May without being deported by a tren@@ ch taken by the council to prevent their sei@@ zu@@ res .
the tac@@ tile group found a gap in the defence fields and expressed its vehicles by a section which remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous person said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were moved on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath where they have thrown stones to the pass@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Council must be comp@@ elled by shame , as he was us@@ eless with the problem of dealing with the problem .
the trav@@ eler were there in May and moved back and are now back again .
more arrived yesterday evening , probably more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long legs to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay for my community , if the Council can &apos;t stop it once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a local which does not want to be called , said , &quot; It is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers , only to be lo@@ oted by another round .
the numbers have increased this time and you even have seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and working with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary steps to take it as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to support our evidence , it is very important that as many residents can call a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must test , when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former hotel Birken@@ hof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is operated .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the hotel Birken@@ hof via the time @-@ ambi@@ ance of the company , on April 13 , 2014 , some 30 000 nights were lost per year and proceeds from the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , confron@@ ted with a dramatic number of refugees who came into the district , the hotel buildings , including a collection accommodation , was provided for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed then in the municipal council .
but especially Freud &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel site and said already back then by serious interested parties in the house .
he should keep right .
the Group Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and will make it back to a house of three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter building .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the previous hotel Birken@@ hof has been standing on the front of the building container in front of the entrance , and when one enters the house , extensive renov@@ ations will be carried out .
the floors were torn out , ceilings , partly removed , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; Thomas Sch@@ erer is talking with our newspaper .
it should be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with ample showers , the input area is changed , new windows are installed .
everything was later becoming &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and conference room belong to the equipment .
you will not be positioned at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ baths but already highlighted in a higher inner city level .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms will be moving wide , expl@@ orer and more .
both tourists , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourist director Michael K@@ rau@@ se he already led , so sh@@ ear@@ ers .
the not@@ ions of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the high level of investments Thomas Sch@@ erer is not going to be set exactly .
barely below one million Euros , it calcul@@ ates .
the outer space is also applied to the front , which is clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is publicly accessible from the restaurant .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us Speci@@ alist Pro@@ jec@@ tor Grand Jury
in Russia &apos;s affair , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump should have appointed a Special Jury for a Special Jury named Robert Mu@@ eller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Panel commenced the work in recent weeks , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of appeal on appeal to persons confi@@ ded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper gave the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded and intensi@@ fied his investigation .
the CNN reported that there are already first inv@@ it@@ ations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ umps &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us secret services charged the Kre@@ m@@ L for a long time , specifically mixed in the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller studied whether there were agreements between Tr@@ ump election campaign and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigation , several men are supposed to be involved in the election campaign as advisor of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to reports Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tr@@ ump private and bust@@ ling environment under the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote some weeks ago that the special director Tr@@ ump took up himself into the center and investig@@ ate the alle@@ g@@ ation whether the President may possibly hin@@ der justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine and decide whether he is to be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys will therefore also be called bill chambers .
usually , they are switched on if it is larger and controversial cases .
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the public pro@@ secutor to serve people for hearing under E@@ id .
according to the CNN line , pre @-@ inv@@ it@@ ations were issued to spin the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were called on a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ ump consultant and father @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his former voting leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were doing well with the conversation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right @-@ experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the en@@ forcement show that Mu@@ eller should not in@@ timi@@ date in his work and that he should be necessary quickly to act quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it would not necessarily mean that Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the de@@ composition of the committee starts at the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason for the reflection of President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , President Thursday spoke a speech in West Virginia to represent Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign in his political opponents .
&quot; Russia &apos;s story is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the subject ad@@ mit the demo@@ c@@ rats a way to feel good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement , he wi@@ pes nothing from the composition of a Grand Jury .
but I usually work in the sal@@ ms , he stressed .
the White House advoc@@ ated all measures to accelerated the work of the special service in &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former FB@@ I CEO James Com@@ ey said three times that not be determined by the President .
one has no reason to suggest that something has changed because it was in the explanation .
Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this rein@@ forcement , demonstrations against tro@@ users were loud , he w@@ anting to hin@@ der the justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him for a set of investigation against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president is under huge pressure due to the investigation .
following the depic@@ tion of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees .
that triggered spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wants to be released .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , as such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could be fired in theory by the President of the Justice of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to bow such a step however .
two groups of rep@@ ubli@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators voted on Thursday according to which the Speci@@ alists no longer could be released .
Antarc@@ tica : gigantic ice@@ berg drives in Antarc@@ tica
in the western Arctic the gigantic ice@@ berg has dissolved itself from the almost seven @-@ fold great@@ ness of Berlin from Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
this was shared by the Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar@@ - and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the climb over a tr@@ illion ton@@ ne and 5@@ 800 square @-@ kilometres big col@@ oss drive now to the north and probably will take two , three years until it mel@@ ted .
it is with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest ice@@ gi@@ ants which have registered in the last three decades .
a danger for people is not coming from him .
to what extent climate change has played a role in breaking the ice@@ berg is un@@ clear according to research .
but overall , however , there have been a series of unusual out@@ breaks in the region for around 30 years , writes the US research centre for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this can be connected with global warming .
the Bro@@ ther@@ ed Kol@@ oss had so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it is therefore constantly growing into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the head of the ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula .
North of this sword was the balance of wa@@ xes and collap@@ ses some years ago .
a complete mak@@ eup may be disin@@ te@@ gr@@ ated there , writes AW@@ I researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot of evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , as the front edge has never pulled down so far as at present .
in addition , the ice plate standing under tension and can be disin@@ te@@ gr@@ ated if a piece of a key is broken .
the melting of sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and ice@@ berg does not increase the sea level since they float on water and ice the ice as much water as it yields to the melting itself .
however , the loss of a sword will lead to flow straight into the sea and flow faster than before .
that could possibly increase the sea level , but only in a limited extent , the British research project indicates the observ@@ ance of Antarc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is the four @-@ largest shaft of Antarc@@ tica according to AW@@ I data , which is almost 50 000 square kilometres .
on the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters .
it breaks off regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is a natural history and does not have any direct link to climate change , the Eis@@ sign is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the start of records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sc@@ el@@ fe@@ i will come back again or in a long @-@ term , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will last for decades .
although these researchers have not attributed to the demol@@ ition of this gigantic ice@@ berg not on climate change , however , in recent decades , many ice win@@ eries of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula have been dismant@@ led .
this long sum@@ mits of Antarc@@ tica stri@@ ves towards South America .
according to the research programme British Antarc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the temperature increase has contributed to the decline .
the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula had war@@ med around three degrees over the past 50 years and t@@ ame the areas in which the temperature is fastest .

the CDU wants to take the initiative in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag together with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG under management and ch@@ illed in management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the request of the parties , the administration should generate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for personal recovery and personal development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term demands of skilled workers but also to counter@@ act applicants .
the overall concept should orient@@ ate themselves inside and outside , show concrete measures for trans@@ continental champ@@ ions and include an apprentic@@ es@@ offensive , CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
it sounds like a good approach .
for the circle has to do with personal problems which you didn &apos;t know earlier .
other cities advert@@ ise good civil servants and employees and offer attractive conditions .
speaking is of a real &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
to do this , a high number of associates , disease or age @-@ related service comes from the service .
the highest time for action thus , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Bre@@ ad , leader of the CDU , goes beyond the joint application with his party .
he already provided a surprise for a f@@ ist surprise when he publicly asked personnel expenses publicly and the other parties flour@@ ished .
people want all the possibilities to be verified , which allow an exit from the municipal office association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are not in the short term to a satisfactory solution , the circle of management should aim with the domestic trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county cities - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to pay better the CDU , employees and officials to pay better than the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly required , enh@@ ancements or more money are available only if you have changes to a higher level of employment .
but the tasks of the circle has grown increasingly in the past years .
only a few weeks ago new rooms had to be established in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute .
not least because of the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and district director Martin Richter has a problem . they have too little personnel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy shar@@ pen@@ ed the tone to NGO migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; life@@ jacket &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has NGOs that deplo@@ y the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they may not continue to continue with new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ itis alert came on a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German aid organisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Youth Ret@@ tet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because their crew had worked effectively with traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that prop@@ elled the illegal immig@@ ration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation since a year , refused to express itself regarding exec@@ utable alle@@ g@@ ations of the Italian State Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ o@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of the human life remains our top priority . so , we are sorry that we cannot operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion to the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can judge all the alle@@ g@@ ations which are currently collected , after we have collected all the information and judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; which was super@@ vised by I@@ u@@ vent@@ a since October .
it is assumed that its crew of infl@@ atable migrants will be delivered to them directly by traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart , so that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can be used again .
at least one such meeting was claimed only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the file of the Prosecutor which was published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected of susp@@ ect the authority of Italian Coast Guard , the life@@ jacket in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not devi@@ ating from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct boats , such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , have to have an Italian police officers who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and rescue operations have so far been agreed to hold on the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ necessarily &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they would not have any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamental changes or disability &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their life actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refused to sign , Nobel Prize Lau@@ re@@ ate Organization of Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) is awarded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants drow@@ ned in Italy in the last few weeks , confir@@ ming that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast @-@ guards and cooperation with local citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month , known about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who have left these countries in the hope to reach Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;

console instead of grass and Bundesliga to work for e @-@ sport
do the sports stars in future be faced with computer consoles , instead of being swe@@ ating in the wind and weather during the stadium grounds ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions fans and huge tournaments with high speeds included .
they also recognized the first federal states that are increasingly eng@@ aging in this area .
the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , which started in early 2015 , followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and gave two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; we hope to enth@@ use all new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says board Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
it is certain that there will be some delay on this move . &quot;
next weekend FIFA World Cup FIFA World Cup will compete in London the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers compete in different clubs .
besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven are qualified .
Robin D@@ utt looks great potential in the E @-@ sport .
now the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has been s@@ own an agency for virtual soccer players .
&quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year olds , that young people will also go into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : they tried to capture all sorts of markets , especially the Asian , to conquer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract one could be far more often present on these markets than once to send the federal states to Asia once a year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what are it doing exactly ?
in the e @-@ sport games , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the FIFA sim@@ ulations of FIFA at the compet@@ itor level .
long ago , as in normal sport , Li@@ gen have established themselves in which the professionals play against each other .
and E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program in Asia by 2022 .
but is it a real sport before ?
for many , the idea is to be used to meet you .
Ingo F@@ rob@@ otic has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sport@@ s- University in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport , because it is a competent and many biological and physical reactions which you can also find in classic sports - for example increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also need cogn@@ itive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console but also exercise their body and watch on nutrition .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ ous sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; d@@ oping is becoming increasingly an issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
checks are heavily man@@ age@@ able in online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sports are missing .
scientists highlights the high integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
players are international on the road , which is like a big global family , there is no inter@@ cultural Hem@@ p .
a study by the consulting firm Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 we have been implemented 50 million euros in Germany , mainly regarding advertising , sponsor@@ ing , and big tournaments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sales have been increased to 130 million in three years .
this is little against the almost 2.4 billion euro Bundesliga .
however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants .
International are many countries already on .

also in Europe some things are doing .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a teaching , says F@@ rob@@ ber .
in the Netherlands and in France , the football league clubs according to D@@ utt are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .

Michelle Carter due to his texts that Conrad Roy had convicted of suicide
a Massach@@ usetts woman was condemned to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through lyrics and calls to suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years were exposed to par@@ ole .
Carter was sentenced to Conrad Roy in June , because he took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free to appeal .
she was confron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argu@@ ed that Mr. Roy had been suffering from a psych@@ ic illness .
in red tro@@ users and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in his eyes , folded hands with folded hands and down@@ ward cut eyes when it was condemned .
&quot; their actions have transformed Conrad Roy , &quot; says the At@@ tor@@ ney of judgment .
&quot; she finished his life in order to make her own better .
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ se shown . &quot;
but he &apos;s lawyer said that it was a &quot; horri@@ ble circum@@ stance that she completely regret . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not find that her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Age or Rei@@ f@@ eg@@ rad or even their mental disease have a significant impact on their acts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pro@@ secutor read a statement of Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy who said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no day in which I don &apos;t trust the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want that he is proud of me and how I go with everything . I try to be with all my pain that we will carry for eternity with us , for his sisters there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would never be persec@@ uted by the lesson that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or would be a aun@@ t for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer the only person to have , with whom I joined every day since my birth , is a pain that I &apos;m always kept for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal prec@@ ed@@ ent , since there is no law in Massach@@ usetts , which makes it a crime to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a vehicle of carbon dioxide in 2014 .
the case moved national attention to himself , after Car@@ ters revealed her to end him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hän@@ g yourself , spring from a building , build yourself , I know not , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several messages , which she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was with his family on vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter attracted attention through the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from any press of the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few , the Carter def@@ endants , the Am@@ anda Knox , which was convicted in 2007 for murder of her British co @-@ resident in Italy , before being acquitted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Knox , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and aid , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learning from the new mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich was allowed to run in the Audi Cup as captain , is no co@@ incidence .
the FC Bayern was entru@@ sted to the Con@@ fed Cup winner a great season - Extra motivation doesn &apos;t hurt .
something else was different in his room in the cabin , that looked Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich immediately , even if the additional clothes was very , very small .
but because far and wide on the second day of Audi crash@@ es , of course , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neuer exists , he made the rush to him from his arm .
&quot; the trainer hasn &apos;t announced it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first deployment as Bayern @-@ captain .
good , the stand could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but I could also interpre@@ t the sign of the coach .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was chosen in the youth play , de@@ but@@ ants , and just out of the un@@ welcome professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as the leader , but he .
when you prefer sugar , one wants to spread a lot to those who wish to keep in mood .
so , who was chosen to compete for the heritage of L@@ ah@@ m , a small extra motivation cannot use well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ imm@@ ick confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player wants to take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was more than Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m over the field .
at the right back , this is now its position , the white band@@ its on the arm did its rest .
and at all I took part in this entry formation as the one who can take the ru@@ d@@ der best into the hand .
he gave orders to direct the un@@ divided tro@@ upe .
he had the sight of the whole , while many others were busy with himself .
Vid@@ al thus to over@@ play his missing fitness ( foldable hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches make it out on the way out of the Asia tour , and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus to aband@@ on their first appearance in Bayern Tri@@ k@@ ot &apos;s first performance .
after all , this worked very well .
in addition , Sü@@ le ran beside K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y in front of the defense , both in so@@ vereign .
the nam@@ ely occupied Nap@@ oli @-@ storm was badly damaged , in addition , Sü@@ le tried successfully for a few times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y showed that the result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; didn &apos;t look like we were hoping for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed good performance at the debut .
temp@@ o change , temp@@ o change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
as unusual this Bayern Welt still exists for the new@@ com@@ ets , one saw in the game .
Rud@@ y was an example of the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ ich passed away after a few cr@@ un@@ chy comments in his new player &apos;s back .
there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; what goes on here I already noticed .
with Bavaria you just have to win any game . &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the New .

company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pe@@ eled minister : economy comm@@ ends Wis@@ dom .
it is often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still an econom@@ ist of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this is shown after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
Cham@@ bers and companies from the region speak on T V request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old Minist@@ ries .
Frank Nat@@ us , chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing gras@@ ps the desires of the economy that Lem@@ ke all@@ es@@ amt blocked . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure politics : the picking of highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands in the priority list of the country now at the top .
this year , the Ministry is hoping for a planning procedure , until 2021 the building is planned .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West Coast of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Employment Agency .
the aim is to take the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minister &apos;s spokes@@ woman in Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees in it a sign for supporting regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) , as of Wis@@ sing , is stim@@ ulated at the wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate @-@ Label to increase the sales of German wine exports in ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to found their own company pra@@ ises the Chamber of Commerce .
the Trier Handwerk@@ skammer Trier looks at the new Master Bonus an additional inc@@ en@@ tive for young trainees , says CEO Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
planned is a premium of 1000 Euro for the E@@ gre@@ ed Master@@ class and 2500 Euro if graduates are independent within ten years after the master@@ class training .
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road construction will be quick facts to manage that at the same time out of the necessary staff , Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Managing Director of the I@@ HK Trier .
to set up mobility of 56 new engineers who wish to set mobility on the regional operation , only 29 digits have been occupied .
the C@@ CI is calling for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
the CDU faction , Christian Bald@@ auf , refers to the calculations of the Audit@@ orium , which invested more than 20 million euros in 2017 and will be proposed by more than 20 million euros less than proposed by country roads .
Frank Nat@@ us is also expecting a concept of the country , just as she wants to solve the cycl@@ one in the region .
furthermore the far broad@@ band construction in the country is far more so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 Regional companies had assessed the power supply in an I@@ HK survey , only with a note of 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about pitch Internet connections and bur@@ sts .

Audi should change 8@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - Aut@@ oh@@ er@@ ators now look at a counter @-@ reaction
a day before the announcement of Audi said BMW that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW chair said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are intelligent options as a ticket restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thus went to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is resident - to offer or restri@@ ct diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday , Daimler presented that there are three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the compliance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ itting the diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ ogenic and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , equipment for neutr@@ alizing the neutr@@ alization of the vehicles to be installed from diesel vehicles , also take it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
the German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful auto@@ fir@@ ings and the signs of the problem .
the companies attempt to avoid the error of Volkswagen , which could regul@@ ate the use of so @-@ called sealing devices if a car has been tested , but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were indicted by Volkswagen , others are explored on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former Head of the Audi Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the car development of Audi in Germany .
the former managers , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is not protected from extra@@ dition and could be set to court in the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in order to have installed a system in order to b@@ ypass the emission regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States was expanded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the study could be un@@ parall@@ eled by Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer delivers proportional to the profit of Volkswagen .

the lav@@ ender is due to lack of conditions due to d@@ rought , and because of the disease , insects and farmers are trying to find solutions to find a big head@@ ache .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert of the CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender of lav@@ ender in Provence was effectively dangerous because the plant has resulted in much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .
this has effects on the lif@@ esp@@ an of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small cy@@ c@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k@@ aden transm@@ its , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and it stands much on the game .
lav@@ ender drops not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant clo@@ cks with a huge number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either under@@ min@@ ated or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered in consideration include a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of ev@@ ap@@ oration out of soil , but also the spray of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties , which are more resi@@ li@@ ent to dr@@ y@@ ness .
the town of Ge@@ isa in the Thur@@ ing@@ ian R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1200 th anniversary this year .
reservations point is this Saturday and Sunday with a mean age .
dealers , guil@@ ds , tra@@ ders , vaginal or a land @-@ sk@@ ating camp are to be experienced during these days in the city center .
the murder of a repor@@ ter under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly Ri@@ od@@ ce normally meet in wed@@ nes@@ days in order to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ al@@ oa , through the organized crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ ceas@@ ing drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists are discuss@@ ing what feels safe : they should take their children to the office , who were the goal of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or let them go home in 2009 .
security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponent , neutral , ally .
they ask repor@@ ter to propos@@ e names for each column - no evidence is needed , perc@@ ep@@ tions and compassion .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the secret list of government or cart@@ ography , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no escape period of violence , and during the whole country the bodies often accum@@ ulate , and in December 2012 , President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to has held his office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are standing by attacks and threats under Bundes@@ schutz and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries .
the latter is the publisher and her inspiration of ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez , in one of his numerous books , wrote on violence in the context of drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his lack is perceived deeply , although its presence is everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows its medieval finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; hangs at the facade of the Ri@@ od@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez , bear t @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or its typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and repor@@ ters discuss@@ ing their divided topics , the trau@@ ma , her night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a UN At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 , in order to process the cases by journalists , according to the Committee on the Protection of Journ@@ alists , it has only instit@@ uted two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , each year linked with drug traff@@ icking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely tried in court .
at Ri@@ od@@ ce they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ al@@ oa , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting , though the terrain is still tra@@ verse .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of security is little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid to spend my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we know not the reason , we stum@@ bled all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ od@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced by his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ f@@ th River . &quot;
the support went away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but there &apos;s virtually nothing at the theme of Val@@ dez .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the extra@@ dition in the United States in January , Sin@@ al@@ oa became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ les@@ ions of the country , because ri@@ val@@ ing fac@@ tions were strug@@ gling to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ al@@ oa anyone can be shot any day or more people on the road or that the cemetery is full of en@@ acted , two @-@ story mouse maus@@ ole@@ ums for drugs . the larger are larger than many homes for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; remember for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peace &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only one car@@ tel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of ri@@ odo@@ ce , is broken with the blame that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first of February , there was the publication of a interview with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of the ri@@ val@@ ing ant@@ it@@ rust fra@@ ctions in war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication might have been anno@@ yed by the sons , construc@@ tive gang@@ sters bought each copy of the issue , once they have been delivered to newspaper he@@ ap .
the second fault was to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same history , leaving the country at its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long survived that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined the company with five colleagues to the establishment of Ri@@ od@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars of shar@@ ehol@@ dings .
in Sin@@ al@@ oa , it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without to@@ ast to the rob@@ ber@@ y problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
with the time , the newspaper earned a reputation because of the brave and honest coverage , and recorded sales and advertising .
repor@@ ters loved it to publish hard tre@@ ad investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that nobody dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the creation of Ri@@ od@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; prestigious award for their reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee on the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursu@@ it of the Mexican drug history , wherever it was .
he gave up voluntarily , he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to live on , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J @-@ Award .
drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ al@@ oa , &quot; said a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV in October last October .
&quot; you have to take the task that falls to you as a journalist - either the or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would not want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you have done about so many things ... why didn &apos;t you say what went before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ od@@ ce @-@ Team toler@@ ates Val@@ dez , the fun bird that could curse the friend who was gener@@ ously with hu@@ gs and ratings , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , going and sit there at the same table .
now ask : was his love for routine his destruction ?
his death also forced them to question their own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how they do their work best , and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it , if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home start and country roads , &quot; to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ dres@@ sage and self @-@ keeping .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
when it sm@@ ells bad , stay away from it .
the anger is , said the publisher of the Ri@@ od@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; od@@ or is a sense that can be du@@ ped ... and then the thing is happening with Javier . &quot;
the old rules as he and others say that in Sin@@ al@@ oa do not apply more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gles , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the employees of Ri@@ od@@ ce met for security training , suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days earlier , Spy@@ ware , which is only sold to governments , has been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen sought protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Ri@@ od@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the she@@ ar , some of the repor@@ ter , whether these officers were among the 50 % of the polic@@ emen , who described the governor itself as not trusted .
it is months since the repor@@ ter went into the mountain scenery , where the drug bound is de facto control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ od@@ ce has led to three main stories .
there were the assass@@ ination of the former well known Box@@ er Julio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ al@@ oa .
they had also a pos@@ thum@@ é to the public spending , focused on the home town of the governor .
and there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or as it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite locally run by drug traff@@ ick@@ ers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter heard from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a polit@@ ician who ruled the ruling Inst@@ itutional Change Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled nearly all the century all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I Govern@@ ors have been accused of high @-@ car@@ cases of corruption .
in fact , Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man did a military attack .
only a few months earlier , the readers used the column by Val@@ dez as the best known source of ab@@ duction .
&quot; earlier we had knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slender body stat@@ ure .
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez is dedicated to the storage room for signs and stick@@ ers who have been protest@@ ing against the mur@@ ders by journalists , because the employees have never expected anything they had ever expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez rub@@ bed a few characters and went next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to the Office of the Office .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its own .
in the whole country journalists have become a loud voice as they wrote in organized protest@@ ers &quot; SOS Press &quot; on walking trails and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez left in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
in a meeting with the Governor of Sin@@ al@@ oa on the day following the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and killed it because they have said the truth .
she has asked that she is post@@ pon@@ ed by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has hurt their objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez again said that journalists in Mexico organised crime , involved government officials and an equal society . &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug traff@@ icking , but also on orders from politicians and security forces involved in organised crime under a blanket .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Media Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials in the past year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because you want to keep mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the k@@ ill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one forget the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth Mac@@ ia in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a notice that was supp@@ os@@ edly signed by the Soci@@ etas by Kartell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones lay in addition to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to rule , like El Nor@@ te newspaper in the northern border of Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua , following the murder of the correspon@@ dents MI@@ RO@@ S@@ LA@@ VA Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to make El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez addressed the drug map with an editorial page on the title page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled the country or even fled the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and search for dangers .
and sometimes they ch@@ ased , as it seems apparently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , which was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who keep back and continue work , there is a daily dance with cra@@ cking decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that the drug traff@@ icking him terri@@ fied .
&quot; Mexico is going to Hell , and so I became repor@@ ter , &quot; he said .
at midnight , last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ od@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk before the office and tran@@ s beer when all their teleph@@ ones started to sum@@ med up .
a series of sliding paintings with band@@ art@@ ful and security forces close to the bathing resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated further , as promised by a number of car@@ tel em@@ bas@@ sies in the region .
on the ground floor , they released the latest news on the website of Ri@@ od@@ ce over mobile .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ enen is in the area - a further shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen , to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they were at all fear , they didn &apos;t show it .
under the huge portrait of the fallen Fo@@ under of the newspaper , which was visible to all sin@@ al@@ oa , the staff of ri@@ odo@@ urs followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when was assass@@ inated on the same day , an intern was asked to send them to reporting the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used clo@@ aking to do@@ dge his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , even if a terri@@ fying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible Nash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was so good that they even could state that his scal@@ y skin was from red@@ dish brown - and they said they had had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the held @-@ held din@@ osau@@ rs , who ever was found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ ossil is a newly discovered type of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ held condition has researchers , who describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic the ar@@ mo@@ red plant @-@ ores is the best known fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ en@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the North of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something of what the bo@@ unding rock failed on the place , and decided to look closer .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to expos@@ e the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) to un@@ cover the thr@@ ill .
after all these hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you bl@@ ink a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , a scientist at the Royal Ty@@ rell Museum where the creature is depicted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will go down to the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found out that this plant car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res , although it is covered with an arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably at risk of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from cra@@ ven , and used a par@@ ach@@ ute technology that is also used as counter@@ part , which is also used by many modern animals .
this could have been allowed to ming@@ le better into its surroundings and devi@@ ate from its enemies , experts say what it suggests that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million year old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs family has made head@@ lines in May and is now shown in the Royal Ty@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the Muse@@ um@@ bri@@ cian Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7.000 hours in making it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible by Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of scales and mak@@ ere@@ ady to document his body .
it discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ady , a widespread defense method in animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creation was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
though the counter @-@ sh@@ ady is common , the results are surprising since the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs was driven by sufficient pressure through flesh @-@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution of the confron@@ tation of the confron@@ tation was f@@ avo@@ red as a means of survival . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but most of contemporary animals who use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , Zeb@@ ras or gir@@ dle - are much smaller and vulner@@ able than prey , which sign@@ alizes that this no@@ dos@@ au@@ r was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behaviour on a massive , heavily ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs ro@@ b of the cra@@ yon must have been , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r is bay .
scientists continue to investig@@ ate the animal on information about his life , including its conservative Dar@@ fur , to find out what it had eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs died when he died , fell into a river and drove out into the sea , where he fell on his back to the sea .
at that time , Alberta was so warm as South @-@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this no@@ dos@@ au@@ r is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with conservative skin , but also in three dimensions will remain , and the original form of the animal re@@ tains , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the result is that the animal today looks almost as it looks like in the early C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period .
you don &apos;t need much imagination to re@@ construct that . if you play only a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it is at bed@@ time . &quot;
the chal@@ k period was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ aurus Rex , lived million years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of its terri@@ fying ancest@@ or .
the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus is one 38 feet ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons heavier monsters .
the scientists who show their latest findings in Current Biology published in Current Biology indicates that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was disp@@ at@@ ched into the sea and m@@ um@@ ified in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ en@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the North of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the Museum it is the survi@@ ving din@@ osau@@ r din@@ osau@@ rs in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were average approximately 18 feet ( 5 feet ) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long sp@@ ikes , mounted by its shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red marine mamm@@ als were s@@ acked by the Western Canada until a flooded river dra@@ ined it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r preser@@ ves his arm@@ our in exquisite opening detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the cre@@ ws still drew up b@@ ump@@ y plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is so rare as a lot@@ tery in the lot@@ tery .
the more I look it , the more conf@@ using it will .
the remain@@ ings of the skin cover still the hol@@ pri@@ zed arm@@ or , which carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot is on his side , his five fingers are spread up .
I can count the shed at his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass@@ acres on the A8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : nearly 30 cars are involved in a mass strike .
there are numerous injured , kilomet@@ ers@@ long st@@ out - and g@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , around 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon with a mass strike of approximately 20 people .
according to the first data of the police were at 17.00 hr@@ s. between the connections of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( District of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 cars , among them also trucks .
there are no data on the exact number of injured parties .
it sounds easy to moderate injuries , said a police spokes@@ man .
a great array of b@@ ail@@ out vehicles was at the accident site .
the A8 was completely closed towards Munich .
in direction of Munich , a ten @-@ kilometer long back was formed .
as a AZ @-@ repor@@ ter reports , it also happens on the oppos@@ ing track to massive disability - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade did not@@ ori@@ ze the number of drivers of the vehicle , which now have to reck@@ on with sensitive stra@@ ins .
shortly after 18 : 45 there was still a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it was a coll@@ ision between a car transporter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group checks &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that nearly everyone has seen before : nothing sitting on the train and sleeps .
or you have deep@@ ened in his work and has just a gen@@ ious thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
the Schaff@@ ner comes and w@@ akes an uns@@ us@@ her or gets the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket office control .
but times of inter@@ ru@@ ptions soon pass by .
the Deutsche Bahn currently tests the &quot; ner@@ less chassis control . &quot;
it is simply confirmed via mobile phone that it is taken and vali@@ dated the ticket .
a test mode is currently running on two routes .
&quot; comes the offer , we know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available for many further traffic routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a train speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the train journey dev@@ alu@@ ation without workers .
to use them , some pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ites must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what &apos;s anyway the most passengers do anyway .
it also has to have purchased via the train , DB Navigator app , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking .
and last one needs a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works : one climb@@ s into the train , calls his ticket to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the test customers will then appear to appear a button for the electronic evaluation .
the draw guide will get a message on their mobile devices that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X is located in the train and took the booked seating place Y .
comes with the train control at place Y , he knows that a passenger is already sitting on the online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , keep on silent , keep silent .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two benefits : one for the client , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers .
&quot; who wants to relax without ticket inspection by our train service , check in the DB Navigator for yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this enables passengers to create their travel time in the train of personal information , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , marketing executive board of DB remote transport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our staff have more time than today to go on to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who travels often , knows that next to co@@ dec and missed the map controls are one of the largest nu@@ ances .
because often , in any case , one of the co @-@ travelers will not have all the documents you need for the exploitation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document must be specified .
the result are endless discussions between train companion and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the finish or greater space and delays in control of your own tickets and takes the rh@@ einf@@ alls at the end of the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test@@ ers can use the new service .
and that also applies to the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart food .
further train numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked yet .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken up to its core .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , the living in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that rented and sc@@ roll@@ te through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post from someone from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police had just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and there is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he named it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah has continually increased on its tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from St. Louis &quot; s territory was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old man who was killed by a white police officers in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ ft@@ ly body that was stretched out on the road and stay there four hours .
&quot; that is wild , &quot; said Fer@@ rell .
but death was nothing new to them and for their community .
she moved her cell phone to talk about a twe@@ et on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos of the police band and people who cried , and from a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns father &apos;s father , who brought a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Police killed just my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she observed a live feeds , where a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said that another polic@@ eman has his rif@@ le and shou@@ ted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell re@@ minded her statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have become acc@@ ust@@ omed to us and we can call it typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment , I felt pot@@ ting .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after his landing at 23 o &apos;clock she brought her 6 @-@ year old daughter from the house of her father , and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on at the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary movie , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a history of survi@@ ving and the protest , the love and the loss , the strength and resistance of resistance who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when Fer@@ rell ended with her daughter , wearing a floral dress and a matching crown , the two had a talk with her , that they had countless times before this morning , &quot; over the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for them that believe in them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she re@@ minded of what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take her , &quot; said he@@ y@@ rell later .
&quot; what happens today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must let it know and be drawn in it .
it must be well developed , not only ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m and organization , but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to be free to free ourselves .
even if I &apos;m lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally experience no dis@@ astro@@ us rac@@ ism , she isn &apos;t unlike the next black women child .
I have the feeling I would have a bad service to keep them far away . &quot;
the first station when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police department , which became a camping area , when the activists on the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson waited .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local company partner who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and helped to transfer them to protest@@ ers .
slowly a new type of ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m began to embrace Fer@@ rell shape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m has changed after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , and notice that she was engaged as a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
everything has come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , a co @-@ director of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar only wanted to document , &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question approached Fer@@ rell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you document or try to find a story you can utilize ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this ske@@ p@@ tic@@ ism has been nour@@ ished by numerous cases of people , often from white - in a community which benefited from their pain and resi@@ li@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to make it different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt .
his commitment was brought closer to Fer@@ rell , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; over the years to Brow@@ ns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we are talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people are depicted , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Fer@@ rel@@ ls Experience - in order to show that it concerns itself in the movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not by a Messi@@ ah leader , but to a community , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , documents from &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls life , as they are in love and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said he@@ rell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability during this work and for the deser@@ tion of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls history repeated the role of the black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two of the three founders of the Movement , which have marked the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we constantly fight at different fron@@ ts .
black , gay women must bear the main burden of all . &quot;
fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement really is held by black women and many black women . &quot;
however , it is said that &quot; this is not a affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rell has been selected as the heart of the film .
&quot; she was the person who stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s no co@@ incidence , even though it was on the front line because with a life at these clo@@ aks as a black , gay wife is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
the news camera in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on disappeared long ago , but the ra@@ cial connections between the church and the police continue to pers@@ ist .
Fer@@ rell is at par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
it describes the soci@@ o @-@ political atmosphere of the area they call their home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
however , she cl@@ ings on a singing and she feels committed to this memory before she left in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to me@@ gal@@ om@@ ania : TV @-@ reader over bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , even though it is not yet built for long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the east of the pedestrian zone has been out@@ dated since the first presentation of 2009 the population in advoc@@ ates and opponent .
cold the topic hardly leaves one .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the one to the bit gallery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This would be really great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ ags ) or simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; me@@ gal@@ om@@ ania &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the advoc@@ ates are planning to build more clients into the city , those other shops will also benefit , fear the opponents , that then the pedestrian zone explo@@ des .
on top of this : the gallery is planned just on the grounds , on which the farmers market hall stands , in the 13 direct marketed its products .
this will conclude with the beginning of the construction work .
the Gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new construction - even for Bed@@ a square with possibility to sit outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been able to buy almost every week in the farmers market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the country always liked very much .
we also discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
we would wish that even during and above all after building the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also that .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ensing : &quot; whether direct sales are settled in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the amount of rent .
this should probably not be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping list for Bit@@ burg ?
whether appar@@ el , Sho@@ es , Dro@@ ger@@ ie or Super@@ markets : I find it redundant .
there are already enough in our city .
one sees how many shop@@ pers are buried here - some for months and years .
however , since there is not even a healthy weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the Mark@@ thalle remains .
for all the goods offered there is fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is fin@@ ite cheap .
as you can see , shop transactions are rented in a shopping center just by larger companies , for the local r@@ ents are often not portable for one retailers .
too bad , special shops there are almost no more and what is left will still disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery doesn &apos;t fit for Bit@@ burg .
especially : where should the farmers market go out during construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even for a duration if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or will it already manage to remove all shops from Bit@@ burg before , even before ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it simply won &apos;t work .
and a shopping center which is empty , no one needs .
in my view , it would have been better to promote a right farming market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmers market , yes , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - fut@@ ile construction projects in Bit@@ burg do not place any more .
when the farmers market are captured , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a perfect simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown that are almost un@@ remarkable - hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were made by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg in W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair@@ cuts , which you have been sent to by Chelsea M@@ anning .
M@@ anning sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth of prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st banned a 35 @-@ year jail term after it had made diplomatic messages to the website of Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming Re@@ em@@ blan@@ ce ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combine its expertise in technology , computer science and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ woman and se@@ minal dis@@ si@@ dent@@ in whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama as he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which could look out from the 30 portraits such as someone with these genom@@ ic data - the many ways that can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent Det@@ er@@ min@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also for identity .
M@@ anning , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had been talking about the identification as a woman since their pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges , among them six violations of the esp@@ ion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ ined , black @-@ white self @-@ shirt , in which M@@ anning obviously sits idle on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a platinum blonde v@@ ig - which she has been associated with .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg had just returned from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers of for@@ en@@ ic arti@@ facts like cigarette st@@ ills and che@@ wing gum , to extract the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look like .
that was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they led an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning , while she was in prison , and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she could not visit this time and could not be photograph@@ ed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprisoned mur@@ ders became un@@ equal ep@@ w@@ ounds that were exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they even created a Comic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Comic &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which predicted a future in which the President Chel@@ i@@ ha@@ ired might and it would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that Obama was indeed only a few days after the book has been published , with his release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , a welcome kind of happy gathering .
there is also now at the opening of the show something depth and strong , since Donald Tr@@ ump takes a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camps and against trans@@ gender ma@@ ids to find new , twe@@ et@@ ering ways , which he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for a strange Tim@@ ing of all these things , she told &quot; things going to happen for a particular reason . &quot;
in an artistic statement on the wall of the gallery , M@@ anning of her excellent signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end of &quot; automated sm@@ ash@@ ing , whose foundation has been gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall , their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousands of Cs and Gs and As , written in a pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was hop@@ ed by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide after the high @-@ developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological respects , we are all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we hope to bring about , that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how openly about genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ ur@@ ious Mem@@ ories are to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition that is kept in its own room is a page from the comic book above mentioned .
it shows M@@ anning , as it shows with a brush@@ less pit in hand from the discipl@@ ines of the United States as King Kong .
&quot; when they are ch@@ ill your speech , then they have won , &quot; says it .
&quot; so never halt the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; said the artist , who greeted me from Philadelphia .
&quot; I still get go@@ ose b@@ umps when I speak about it . &quot;
M@@ anning has not seen the exhibition not personally - but as it was supposed to do in the comic book - but if it should do it , then it will be welcomed in the center of the room by the masks , coming together like hor@@ des of protest@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was also aimed at how everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 , man@@ ger steel ) in which their genetic l@@ ad groups were written with pencil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement , who formed to Chelsea , like the movement , which was also behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for murder
a national crowd is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who had been chosen as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday , the arrest warrant for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the files of the Local Court of Cook County are showing .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stal@@ ks .
a warning system was announced by the Chicago police department , that the body was discovered on July 27th .
officers received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim of several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still explained on the site of the prison for dead , and det@@ ec@@ tives examine the stit@@ ches as murder while police search for the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
since 2007 , L@@ ath@@ em has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice @-@ President for University Coun@@ ts , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em was now admitted to the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter which is examined by the competent authorities and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates in this research , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the university and the Som@@ er@@ ille College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in touch with the police in the United Kingdom and willing to help the US investig@@ ators in every conc@@ ei@@ vable way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the testimony told that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and w@@ anting to be aware of it .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago police department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he needs the susp@@ ect to challenge the susp@@ ect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has an idea of its where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities will help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police got a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , which had just received an en@@ caps@@ ulated tip that had just happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as a very cruel man .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear if the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the sacrifice had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police currently works at the time axis and the background of the victim and has a variety of mot@@ ifs , including a possible body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian Vice President Mut@@ ko
Russian Vice @-@ vic@@ tor Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the schedule , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM on the second part of the WA@@ DA is intended to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re@@ integration of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organisation &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t exist which could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria mentioned in the list is , however , that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities justified the reported results of the WA@@ DA authorised by the Canadian attorney Richard McLaren to accept publicly supported d@@ op@@ ings in the Russian sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; referring to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we perform the inquiry that our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has inserted a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
but there were no government programs , and we will not add something that does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os words voted with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales outlet R@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v had problems in the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ conditional , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the WA@@ DA in November 2015 as part of d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als from the implementation of d@@ oping control in Russia .
however , it was permitted to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the principal quar@@ ti@@ ers of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli explained that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving into the right direction &quot; to be used again .

&quot; &quot; &quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , converting company tail@@ or @-@ made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surveys , collect confi@@ dential answers in real time and watch the warmth of your problem areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , which can report bad behavior .
and when the main business is involved , complaints go directly to the supervisory board .
&quot; the court of public opinion has gras@@ ped the re@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent .
when a company is found that his employees either treat or un@@ ra@@ cial , it can experience co@@ stly consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , worker @-@ fluctu@@ ation and complaints , &quot; Quin@@ lan said .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has deployed Conver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and methods and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted to issue a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ timi@@ dating and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Coun@@ sel , who said it was not a good way to pursue the complaints of employees .
well , since the company Conver@@ ts , problems that were used by exec@@ u@@ tives , which were used in offices in cities or countries , have been hidden and identified more quickly , according to discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair inter@@ ns .
&quot; I can approach this holi@@ stic , 360 degree view into the experience of employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect shareholders from employment law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies started to investig@@ ate ethics , values and employees in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen broke out for ethnic violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , &quot; said Quin@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies recognised that you could not prevent dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor the ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as service , and buttons the company with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start@@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding from firms such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million .
G@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising in view of the connected nature of enterprises , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than before .
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only possible .
the staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are glad to be in a company that is worth taking their voices , and that the work you do , then feel more profitable to do this company , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Lin@@ ke@@ d@@ In which is both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach revenue if their port@@ folios are running well . companies are running well when employees are going to employ and engaged .
if the Analytics tools promise third , commitment and the use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the employee is important to the employees of the workplace culture .
but the data is us@@ eless if the manage a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it can have a expect@@ ation that changes are on the way .
and if the Shift does not come fast enough , or not at all , this may provo@@ ke dec@@ ep@@ tions and employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in Business Management company Kot@@ ar International , who has seen the company too much for collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you are not going to follow our staff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Did you really hear me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and if you don &apos;t care about why I should ? &quot;
Madison Re@@ ed , who now carries out monthly members of staff , was able to initi@@ ate measures on the same day if a problem of G@@ lin@@ t is reported so deliver@@ t .
and after collecting the feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re @-@ organize several teams within the company and to create a communication training to tackle the problems .
at Ruby Tuesday , the company always gives new insights on the staff , and it hopes that a long @-@ term view that leads to better ties of workers in a sector which is well @-@ known for high sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you will lose customers too .
and if you lose your customers , then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CAA dispos@@ es two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for bru@@ ising
it runs at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A Foot@@ ball@@ ers talk on one side of the new practice fields of the team on the campus .
several of them moved out their tri@@ cot and show the back of silence from the first day of the training camp .
they represent a lunch break for a good part of the team .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return after the three @-@ hour practice , before they return to the water@@ man football center next morning at 6 : 30 pm .
&quot; this is a real tre@@ t@@ mill for the boys the next three days , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday became a Tuesday .
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and it actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
that is why the first three trainings of the U@@ CL@@ A are supposed to begin at 19 : 15 in order to satisfy the already packed schedule of players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Brotherhood had moved to the beginning of the camp during the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six hours in West@@ wood .
they should hold 18 exercises during August . 20 pre @-@ opening preparations for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
MOR@@ A told that he supports the rules change by the N@@ CAA support even if they add another point to the many busy routes of the player .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous burden three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply have pressed them , they plac@@ e@@ ed themselves , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really magnificent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , what is covered by the clear sight of its fields by a adjacent park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class which is already covered with foot posts that will be no small task .
brood @-@ players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a is spac@@ ed that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people can rent a room there and then set themselves there to record a practice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video and exercise of one exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking lot 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not so much worried about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook aims to intensi@@ fy facts re@@ review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook want to send more potential articles with third parties to third parties and their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network appeared on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight so called F@@ ake News .
the company said in a review on its website that it will start with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible wr@@ inkl@@ es and send them to fac@@ tual checking that might be able to display result of the fact testing from the original article .
Facebook was critic@@ ized as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake News , many of which believe they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem is also become a big political issue in Europe , whereby the French voters were flooded with false stories in May with wrong stories , and Germany will support a plan to quickly eliminate the social media networks as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday Facebook appeared in a separate statement in English that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts review will start .
&quot; in addition to the realisation , which stories of fac@@ ulties are third parties interested , people want to make decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; link &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; article , and works on other changes to his news feeds to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past the small Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a sque@@ eze @-@ music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s .
but Scot@@ ney has seen 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of its cozy seat at the ir@@ l River valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ l@@ ari@@ ous Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; says he we@@ ars .
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; spann@@ ed the time from the Middle Ages through the era of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he thought unexpected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b @-@ print on the side of a letter which was written by a double player in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s his thum@@ b @-@ print !
and letters sm@@ ells of smoke , because at that time men burned up fire because of light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect , as if he also were there .
Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for anyone who is defeated so with old papers , that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To be honest : I have been using my welcome note a little over &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) to be true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rho@@ des spent his days with the vi@@ kt@@ ori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and study the many treasures and curiosity of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ d@@ ards at the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he walked through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with ac@@ coun@@ ties , gar@@ dening and sometimes also with the artists presented in the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &apos; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust first received full access in 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Rho@@ des encounter@@ ed a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he said as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of years in which ar@@ ist@@ oc@@ rates said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , throw it on the loft &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Emp@@ ires , Maps , who said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guys , let everything go down ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a base to gather on a bro@@ ader base in English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves the newly built castle to join the farmhouse of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a recording of a ri@@ ot who appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the peas@@ ant arose in this area and I thought that an insur@@ rection was a good start .
perhaps the two together are connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which the history of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ro@@ cker is telling the family Dar@@ rell for seven years hidden during the English re@@ formation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , shown in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler Arthur La@@ rell portra@@ yed his own fun@@ eral passing a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later , when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family from Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gent@@ lemen appeared to be quite happy to have debts and make money for things they could not afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men ma@@ sts their school@@ mate by giving the rich old women , I imagine them as a bunch of good looking guys , with a talent to advert@@ ise inheritance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the end of his essay in the castle Rho@@ des in search of other unique writing experience
he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ ma@@ v@@ ki , the territory of a Jubilee from the early 20th century , which has been re@@ demanded by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to finish my dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle sh@@ rou@@ ded in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the unve@@ iling of the 301 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign for introducing a new roof@@ top brand ( Rundschau of Thursday ) on Friday .
until Thursday , mayor Otto NEU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team want to stop the logo and the slogan by Nelson Art@@ z .
until the end of August there will be a celebration of the campaign to be a celebration on the island Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? , &quot; ask the makers of action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we think that ( of course ! ) isn &apos;t really &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she writes on her yesterday un@@ official website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make clear that something is better than it seems .
we basically believe that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
in this promotion , it is more than just &quot; a logo and a slogan , &quot; it reads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is to form@@ ulate a single command to form@@ ulate a distinctive element that is unmistak@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , she was standing in the competition with other municip@@ alities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f can be charged a medium five @-@ digit amount and will cost the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erd@@ ogan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es over pen@@ sion@@ ings and convey@@ ance in the officer cor@@ ps .
that is also this week .
a normal procedure at first sight .
but nothing is routine in Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the session took place no more in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the office of the prime minister .
under the presidency of the government , the five Deputy Head and the Minister of Defence , In@@ ner@@ es , Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part .
in this way , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in number .
the government is pulling the re@@ ins in the military .
the general staff of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the Army , the Air Force and the Navy were depos@@ ed .
since the failed coup , head of President Erd@@ ogan 169 of 326 Gener@@ als and Admir@@ als has fired .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army &apos;s ranks - mostly because of alleged connections to the Movement of Ex@@ ile @-@ Pre@@ dig@@ ers Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ ogan as Dra@@ h@@ tz@@ er of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 persons who are directly involved in the test attempt , we have been negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the day following the coup , Erd@@ ogan already called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God gift &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he give him the opportunity to clean the forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Erd@@ ogan is really on the handle ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hur@@ ri@@ yet published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ eas@@ ages in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff there is concerns of an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army , which manifest itself in the abol@@ ition of the head@@ land ban for Sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main@@ tain@@ er in the army and the security forces continue to continue .
in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ ogan appointed a further 73@@ 95 public service officer , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
thus it seemed when Erd@@ ogan is t@@ amed up the military .
the gener@@ als used to be the real masters of the country .
three times they claimed their role as a guard of the sec@@ ular state of state .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ ogan &apos;s power pushed step back by step , not least under appeal on the reform agenda of the European Union .
former officers say , Erd@@ ogan drives system@@ atically the Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine , a named officer , who sought asylum from persecution against persecution in foreign countries asylum , sought refuge in a few years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full extrem@@ ists and sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not allow NATO to be cold .
anyway , in the alliance , there is doub@@ ts about the operational read@@ iness to carry out the Turkish army .
the management structures and operational abilities were &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; said NATO diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the Green Card rules
&quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a new US immig@@ ration plan to change the Green Card rules , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he sees to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages , and will do billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by going to the US &quot; way &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the citizens from other countries Green Cards will be issued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and knowledge about our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to restore course for race mil@@ eage
in recent months over the future of the mil@@ eage sh@@ utt@@ les had been denied . now it is said to be quite fast .
before the end of the year , the tourist train is scheduled to be built .
in order to secure the future of the race mil@@ eage in the long term , according to the website , construction work will start in the course of this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the deci@@ ding to further order and restore the Ilmenau race track , the country is particularly important for the tourism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; declared road secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the repair of the route ran to approx . 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country over@@ take 75 percent .
the contract on which shuttle is planned to be ordered from the land on the basis of the ship will currently be al@@ igned .
the Ministry and the Southern Gateway as the operator are already certain about the technical details .
&quot; this means the road@@ map , which ran to the vehicles and the quality standards , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l .
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
the racing bike will thus be ordered on December 2017 at regular intervals .
the racing bike shuttle is a popular rail link between the train stations and the race tracks .
in the past months , a pilot was tested in the course of a pilot plant , if the route has been utilized by a lot of people to order them again in the future .
the track is also very di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the R@@ ise of Sex Robot is real , and we should worry about
just as you thought that in 2017 there can be no more crazy , a new report about the technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) has published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Emer@@ itus Professor for Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their rise seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of ni@@ pp@@ le and type of finger nails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but the companies provide a lot of them , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key on the release of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sa@@ exp@@ anders have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone that feels warm - with consci@@ ously human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also adapt his robot according to his beliefs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and select everything from the eye color of the robot through the form of ni@@ pp@@ le up to type or colour of his fing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is still qui@@ eter , as many robots possess the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person@@ alities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would look like a Step@@ per woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sa@@ exp@@ anders have developed to robots with a silicone cone .
for example , the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot makes it possible for example users to adapt their robot to the properties they look appe@@ aling , for example , ho@@ ver@@ sive .
and then there &apos;s the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ Robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed person@@ alities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; who convey@@ s the impression of school@@ ing and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; black@@ ened the site of True Compan@@ ion .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you like , etc .
throughout the day she also has her m@@ oods - like real people !
it can be tired to be fixed on conversation , or it can be &quot; in mood &quot; !
there are many distur@@ bing aspects on this asc@@ ension of sex rob@@ bers - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ t@@ onal female qualities to ra@@ pe when you encounter a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : dis@@ gust@@ ing ) Far@@ rah is , in@@ qui@@ l one of the most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy compatible with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it &apos;s called on the website .
however , this sex robot is not just a fet@@ ish or simply just another sex toys .
their emergence and their increasing refin@@ ement have a little dar@@ ker and cruci@@ fer@@ es in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a wish to sex with submission as optional en@@ core .
most men will of course have no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R re@@ members their increasing popularity , they remain pro@@ vision@@ ally on the mar@@ gins of consumer culture .
but what flows from the border zones , in terms of the spirit of time in which we live , be very educational .
and many people are not strange or ins@@ ulting , until they give the free market to them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these high @-@ developed sex robots are threatened in a time in which the rights of women are threatened all over the world in which there has been a presi@@ ding in the White House to have been sexually attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most horri@@ fying aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images that works dev@@ oured , but how realistic this vision is .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though with por@@ nost@@ ic propor@@ tions ) .
her buil@@ ders want it to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , to the point , when it comes to their &quot; person@@ alities , &quot; the robots get no real women .
they can &apos;t separate or simply go away from their companion .
they have no placement or background history , nothing , suggest@@ ing about independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination .
expressed differently : they are counter@@ parts slaves .
or to express it in the Rede@@ mp@@ ing of 2017 : maid
Tr@@ ump power performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney as the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has become a Bin@@ sen@@ al of the tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions which have polar@@ ised the US elec@@ torate , also split families in small format . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around Christmas and Than@@ ksgiving there were newspapers in the USA newspapers with advice on how to deal with the hor@@ ror from Tr@@ ump choosing relatives .
we are supposed to stern ourselves all , in order to make our filter bubbles .
fewer notes have been raised by m@@ umps , families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ hand poet , who lives in Chicago and had long been busy with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family who visited me this week in New York .
she re@@ minded me that unity can have a strong effect against a common enemy .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House everybody knows , including the rep@@ ubli@@ can relationship that had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange at the same side .
around the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it seems to be in another context that this will also bring considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dep@@ uty effect of his presidency has the force to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that his m@@ ittens of one day will no longer be to@@ asted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is still a terri@@ fic long@@ time scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of los@@ s@@ ity in comparison to his standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today I found myself from an active nost@@ al@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s hil@@ ari@@ ous version of dec@@ lining - the dog sat on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both of which occurs as a very mild off@@ ences .
when Tr@@ ump walks , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be only spiritu@@ ally healthy to qualify for an im@@ meas@@ ur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin in the city was , we brought our children to Car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ers of the New York Park department , and the top three dollars you can spend in town if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all the c@@ low@@ ns are cra@@ f@@ ty and the animals turn to look full of their own shoulders - extremely fin@@ ster and the climate per@@ formers convey@@ ed this strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines will be familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city becomes not just the dream .
twenty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not across the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage , but the theme Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big roundabout in the North of London .
but Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sel is still a strange magical experience , as there are two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can walk on it and have a great time .
if I could rate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but luck@@ ily nobody has asked .
on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same plus the option to pay off with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down , which should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required .
poor woman in the department store exc@@ used exc@@ use , while I am tired of the experience making my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moved from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for the second time in a hospital visit .
last year he was taken to the hospital because of the treatment of s@@ led to his hand joints , according to a case in his prison cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against the first death sentence .
he killed steam @-@ amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s Day in 2013 , taking them several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his home in Pre@@ toria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he had his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal in@@ tru@@ der who hid themselves in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal to Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell on the six @-@ year jail term of Pist@@ ori@@ us as she is very careful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Criminal Law Authority announced that it is to be set to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the ob@@ jection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs the danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years when the pro@@ secutor are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
a farmer was found a curious egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four quad@@ ri@@ fts from F@@ ries and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were dischar@@ ged into the school holidays and the leading schools .
three of the students will go to the high school , four in the high school .
Angel@@ ika S@@ itte greeted the parents and representatives of the public at the mayor of Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .
as a symbol for the release of school , the 29 students of the four classes run under the guidance of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eagle , who grew up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the m@@ lower ch@@ ar carried a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The eag@@ les in chicken &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to brood from his chick@@ ens .
instead of a chicken fever there came out a small eagle .
but the hope of making a chicken smote him , the eagle spread out on a high mountain its wings and s@@ wore .
after that , the classes showed three and four in the Y@@ von@@ ne Frank study .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young go@@ ads to carry the cylinder .
the eagle state for the integration , Dr. Angel@@ ika S@@ itte said .
indeed , the young was different from the other young ones ( ch@@ icks ) , but belonged to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
they wish every four @-@ whe@@ at@@ ss@@ ler , that he feels accepted in his new school .
it followed than@@ ksgiving to the colleagues , the former school@@ master Michael Müller , who will always start teaching and handed the parents .
the ch@@ ick @-@ time is now over , the class Sophia Schumacher said .
she let her students be very odd after two years of instruction , as it was a really great time .
and finally they can rely on the four @-@ ja@@ ws .
in the end , all students received a song from summer time and summer days .
with the children there was great joy .
eight first kl@@ ands have already registered for the new school year .
authorities det@@ ain two Bulg@@ arians for Il@@ legal Camping in Greece

on the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal refugees caught in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released , while currently an investigation is underway .

software update for diesel vehicles : what these people need to know now
how accurate is the software update instead ?
do you have to participate in the action ?
an overview of the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group offered software updates for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars .
they are expected to improve the emission behavior of cars from the emissions trading of Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or bad are excluded from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Auto Club Europa has ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the handled software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates earlier apply only to the vehicles , the Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their re@@ arm@@ ament was ordered by the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the makers have announced an efficient implementation in the next few months , but still no exact date .
Daimler convey@@ ed to write any of these persons .
if an inspec@@ ting may be ob@@ sol@@ ete , it will be completed within their framework .
how long will the change in@@ dig@@ n@@ ered for a total ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
the hang@@ ar is made up of manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act on the environment so far . &quot;
how long should this update last ?
the upgrade itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ time can be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE should be waiting for .
probably foreign manufacturers would be tra@@ ced , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is a massive price comparison of Euro @-@ 4 cars now ?
the ACE fear this .
but just in the regions where the quot@@ a threat@@ ens .
in rural areas there has been no value losses for elderly diesel .
the ACE av@@ eng@@ es to be sold with one sale yet .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center @-@ Award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the glam@@ orous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony was promised under President Tr@@ ump to become political .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first Rap@@ per one of the prestigious Kennedy Center awards .
in this year , singer Gloria E@@ ste@@ fan ( 68 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the schol@@ ars in this year .
the awards will be presented early December .
traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump took hold of a reception and join the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the award winner announced by the progressive TV series announced already to do participation in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Presi@@ dency has decided to neg@@ le@@ ct the arts and human rights - to even withdraw funds - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old E@@ ste@@ fan emphas@@ ized she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to clear their visibility .
the Kennedy @-@ Centre appointed by the former president of John F. Kennedy in the U.S. capital .
the earlier award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we are making the city life worth
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s city builder , works next year in R@@ ente .
the site is already written - suitable candidates are however rare .
W@@ acker is a master builder at the age of 31 .
and the work is still fun to tell him how he talks in the press interview .
he talks about diversi@@ fied , but also demanding tasks , waiting for his successor .
at the same time no application wondered that so far no application submitted to the requirements profile .
the city is seeking the nearest possible time an architect or building engineer .
this should be - with regard to the regular redund@@ ancy - even enough time for el@@ aboration .
since Has@@ lach has func@@ tioned for the administrative community as a sub @-@ building contrac@@ tor , candidate must submit relevant read@@ ings .
because this function wants to keep the city any way .
if you can &apos;t fill it anymore , the citizens would have to travel to Off@@ enburg .
but its proximity to the city and itself is important , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate as well as good mood between authority and citizens .
in over 30 years , there have accumulated several major projects , based on the ack@@ ers with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life worth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure of the building and its staff is safe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , diverse projects are eag@@ erly awa@@ ited : re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a areas and the park@@ land parking lot .
the Kin@@ ties between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still a topic .
the latter only deal with about 1.5 million euros in beech , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; explains W@@ acker .
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
lin@@ k@@ age be present for a city builder of great play room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s its own back@@ yard and gar@@ dening can be flexi@@ bly re@@ acted on frequent occasions .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says h@@ ack@@ ers , and the design of the green plants are often praised by citizens and visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one eye &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if new buildings are approved , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; urban master builder &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyway , the master builder carries a high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , everything goes on my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been here for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has been around for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , that his successor goes long , W@@ acker : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really identified and remain with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continu@@ ity is not only important for a good working climate but also for the further design of the city .
who wants to bury W@@ acker as a Graduate Engine@@ er should have studies as a Graduate Engine@@ er or Bachelor with specialist architecture , should have a proper course in the fields of construction and building law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt of Hoch@@ ing- und Tief@@ bau , Building Planning , Gr@@ under@@ lining chairs , municipal utility property with building yard and gar@@ dening property , as well as Unter@@ e building law , including monument protection .
bicycle on lines thrown : southern ground closed
according to police , previously unknown offen@@ ders had the blue bike on rail track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the pipes .
these were so badly damaged that the coming freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpet@@ rators and seek for the night hours after them .
near the crime scene , a rock robot and a bike driver had been observed near the crime scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a military bu@@ oy@@ ancy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB &apos;s spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch , to AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crimin@@ als have brought herself in great danger and also risk the mig@@ rat@@ ory traffic .
besides the damage at the Lo@@ k and the grounds as well as the late @-@ minute drive and the cost of rail service , P@@ ön@@ al &apos;s train can also come to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considerable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was fixed on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the South railway line could be led without disabilities .
almost ten people were afraid of Friday morning , two of them visited the correspondence .
goods are not falling , but they were delay .
according to Ö@@ BB &apos;s spokesperson , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged for 200 metres over@@ pipes .
ins@@ ul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to relie@@ ve IB@@ D ( Flamm@@ ability )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study asser@@ ts exactly the contrary : a diet that is rich in flesh @-@ based proteins and dairy products could alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel diseases .
the incur@@ able condition , which affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom , causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ ring or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while the people are usually advised to ease me@@ ats and dairy products , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an of protein they contributes to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , stated that immune cells in the gut are pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food are not to enter the body .
cells that are unable to trigger inflamm@@ ation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and damage the body without dam@@ aging them .
when balance is too wide toward inflamm@@ ation , it may result in an anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments it was noted that a type of tolerance for the immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacter@@ ium in their initi@@ ates .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said , &quot; We have a connection between the bacteria art - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ oma , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an had mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
it suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an in@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an diet toler@@ ant , less infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ om@@ ination , if the same system also stands at people .
the Post@@ doc researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan , exam@@ ines a kind of immune cell that encour@@ ages the tolerance , when a group of academic studies had such cells , but a different group of the same tribe , which was accommodated separately .
it believes that the difference had to do with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , normally living in the gast@@ ro @-@ intest@@ ine .
the mice of mice were sequ@@ enced DNA sequ@@ encing and there were six bacterial species found in mice , but without them in mice .
mice were drawn in a ster@@ ile environment so that a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ oma was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria applied to the immune system , the researchers received L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then sur@@ rendered small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from mice .
immune cells developed to toler@@ ate cells .
when the active component was cleaned from the fluid , it proved to be a by@@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an @-@ metabolism that is known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers spread the amount of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an in the feed of mice , the number of such cells decreased by around 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ es have hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ant producing cells such as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect us in our gast@@ ro @-@ intest@@ ines .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an auxiliary products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop as many people as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an were found in people with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote as these cells are inflamm@@ ation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ ous values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic to a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot;
at Manchester United , with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , a &quot; Genius &quot; signed , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pounds of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre@@ season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressed by the role as Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira according to adv@@ ances .
M@@ atic was , however , excluded from the Pre@@ par@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and gave only 45 minutes to make M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him be ready to be ready before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho will be the starting XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho left another new eng@@ agements as well , but he in@@ sist@@ ed that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic work &quot; three of his four primary eng@@ agements as well .
&quot; three of four got to get there , thanks to the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. flight manufacturer Boeing has drawn the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state , but drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in Mich@@ igan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner on the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the radar screens was the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole thing was a stamina test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising .
thus the number was painted 7@@ 87 and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
but how the wind turns : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD head , the social Democ@@ rat Prime Minister met with a certain concern at Berlin .
just no failure from the party center , just no head@@ winds from the wa@@ ist@@ band - so was the most important wish of the vote .
since Martin Schulz led the party , it has changed considerably .
since then , employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House ob@@ serving the events in the SPD @-@ ruled state capit@@ als .
since the beginning of the year , Mr Schulz has not been described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were grav@@ ings .
and one after another .
following the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the CDU looks a general signal against the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green cannot easily gover@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said CDU @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising leader of a Green Party led by Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) broke out in a severe crisis .
five months before the country elections , his red @-@ green coalition therefore lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the Green Federal President Michael Kell@@ ner asked the Gre@@ et @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party of Lower Saxony , to give back their mandate .
transferred to the CDU means a clear for@@ gery of the voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ oy@@ ancy must immediately give her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the German Managing Director and elec@@ toral campaign of the Gre@@ ens in Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this should not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she sigh@@ ed a SPD voting , when the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message reached the party &apos;s headquarters in Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands as the CDU out of the CDU for the CDU without their government majority .
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD country associations .
and nobody knows what &apos;s next .
the mis@@ ery began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , no more , cal@@ ms down the com@@ rades .
after the state elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it became then also - and everything was much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to de@@ af , the Düsseldorf @-@ ple@@ a pushed the party smoothly .
lab@@ ori@@ ously the com@@ rades looked up again in the weeks afterwards .
then when she had just sli@@ pped new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit was coming from Hamburg .
and with him the next blow came .
mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD head of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus at the weekend because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because he did so pretty wrong in crisis communication , what you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz is fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan Weil .
because of the VW @-@ emission and its role in the supervisory board , the Lower Sax@@ on Prime Minister has been in criticism for some time .
mi@@ ese change values came out .
anyway , or perhaps , because in the past weeks , because in the past weeks , he tried to set acc@@ ents to acc@@ ents .
the amb@@ ition of the former mayor of Hanover , to build its power in Berlin , was also not hidden in the category of Martin Schulz .
they left him , because they spoke of because a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
because at the part@@ ment of the party , the Sax@@ on Green Party is basically not fault .
and Schulz is not at all .
sometimes , the com@@ rades ende@@ av@@ our to keep their own ranks .
their wrath is focused on the Green , and here above all for the down@@ ward par@@ liament@@ arians in T@@ v@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and demo@@ cr@@ atically mis@@ sive as Mrs. T@@ west presents their own kar@@ mic host@@ esses on the interests of all the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of Par@@ ent in the SPD Bundestag Convention , the Editor Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ oy@@ ancy has not been elected as a direct can@@ did@@ acy but on the country list of the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party , as the Sax@@ on de@@ pu@@ ties continued .
the logical consequence would be that she gives her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD German Parliament , compl@@ ained a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters four years ago said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people have made Stephan because of the prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony candidate for the presidential election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of the CDU @-@ members fal@@ si@@ fied the election outcome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clearing the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there was more or more in the CDU of Lower Saxony .
funding for municip@@ alities III
he who wants to re@@ build in the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition to this informed mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of Ste@@ g city development on Wednesday in sens@@ ory .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review to the previously known .
there have been in sens@@ ational san@@ itation areas since 1991 .
at that time , in the san@@ itation region I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
the subsi@@ dy amounted to at least 60 percent between 2005 and 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the earlier renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; successful project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it &apos;s important to encourage the interior development as well as not only new building areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , the President of the State of Directors was given that there will be a san@@ ction zone III .
the funding amount amounted to 8@@ 33 333 Euros , of which 500 000 euros came from the country , the remainder of the church sensation .
how does a sanit@@ ising area emerge ?
you will continue to examine so Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is also a role of san@@ itation in the planned territory in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if necessary , the District Court can then also move again .
the jet@@ ty came on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cell@@ ars presented the content of the federal state program &quot; Social City , &quot; which would then be carried out as part of the refurb@@ ishment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; core of the programme is the prec@@ alisation of inner cities , the improvement of living and employment relationships and maintenance and extension of infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the measures would be objective which is called per plot .
the rehabilitation area would then be established as a by@@ laws .
the authorization period for funding exp@@ ires since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year the existing survey would only be carried out , within the framework of those involved in the san@@ itation region to fill out a quest@@ ionnaire .
in November or December , the decree is scheduled for completion in the coming year with the refurb@@ ishment .
Mr Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that every Commun@@ e had to carry out proper appe@@ als .
it is about jud@@ ging and decide the urban distances , and to decide when will be renovated and in what circum@@ ference .
there will also be a mem@@ orandum for the respective property in the land register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann would like to come back again and make a picture of the situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Got@@ an stressed that an essential success factor for the project may be the participation of the participants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore it will be quest@@ ionn@@ aires that will be post@@ pon@@ ed to citizens in the coming weeks and be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the yellow quest@@ ionnaire is the &quot; building and boundary bow , &quot; which makes it possible among other things around the building state and the refurb@@ ishment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey quest@@ ionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; can be made to size , graduation and residents of a residential space . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bo@@ ther &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bo@@ ils can only be completed when used in the building business premises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , please note , God pointed out that a completed quest@@ ionnaire was not at the same time an application on feed .
new construction measures are unable to be eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler emphas@@ ized that the distribution of the funding according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ hound principle &quot; function - who comes first , is ste@@ aling first .
you can reserve no funding options for later . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ies II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project are still shown to make the present a renovation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor sets itself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country that is equipped with a micro@@ chip that he can open his door@@ step , and even entering his office with a hand@@ ful movement .
Steven Nor@@ tham , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and fore@@ finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined himself with Dr. Ge@@ off Watson , an advis@@ ory an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ist in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out after medical standard .
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ plan@@ ated micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ tham also wants to change the castles at houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional cost of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now fitted both at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the stick .
the promotional costs of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the decision of the White House , a marine helicopter to fly to the South La@@ wn for one event , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military , which were left to the TIM@@ E Magazine , up to 24@@ .000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as the Navy One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief Executive Officer of the White House , made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helicopter produced in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was exhibited in addition to a sail from Maine , a fire@@ man from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft from Mississi@@ ppi .
the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , after the records at the South La@@ wn , after the recordings of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Commander of H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 , on the eve of the event , was the Deputy Prime Minister of Aviation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn on July 17th at 7@@ am , and so long stayed , until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
note that if departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of service hours a second team would require a return flight .
the original flight crew remained at the helicopter during the event , while the security guards during the time on the ground remained at the ground .
the recording provided by the TIM@@ E was not clear , whether a second flight &apos;s crew was not required .
the Hatch Act forbi@@ ds the federal government to use state property for political purposes .
data sets indicates that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 could ask if the event could viol@@ ate the destiny .
&quot; a question that we asked , was whether it was a violation of Brands Hatch and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the commander wrote .
&quot; sounds like you are locked , &quot; he said the dep@@ uty Commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was described by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political tones .
at the event , President gave a violation of the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated efforts to permit government regulations .
the use of the aircraft , known as the Navy One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically beneficial purposes .
presi@@ dents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
in February , Tr@@ ump led an investigation into the background as the presidential guard in front of his first fighter aircraft in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential guard .
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the substitute of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training flights in the region around Washington and South La@@ wn by depos@@ iting the US President at the White House with precise Zen@@ tim@@ eters .
at the beginning of July when Tr@@ ump was on the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted among the training budget for the month , said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew an additional 11 hours on this day for &quot; Non @-@ Presi@@ dential Supp@@ lements . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers were not a burden to any of the other pro@@ ps which were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man by S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company had not been involved to put helicop@@ ters on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 does not maintain bud@@ get@@ ary records for the presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ aries of the Ministry of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D refund rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however amounts to 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
records of the unit list the flight time of the plane than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below that rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for the refund conditions is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the do@@ ings for Do@@ D do not contain the personnel costs , but also consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Sean Sp@@ itz , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present those week things which are manufactured in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ itz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the State of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
of course , it is reasonable to emphas@@ ize it . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ viewed by helicopter when he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire brig@@ ade .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of kne@@ eling task
the runner @-@ up of the second tennis league starts at the T@@ V T@@ eller rides .
the TC @-@ blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss will begin tomorrow at 11 : 00 in Kiel in the Tab@@ ulated Su@@ chs@@ dorf S@@ V .
despite five games still spot@@ less balance , the leader of the second tennis league has won the sense of reality .
team Director Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay has no respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team that plays in quite a similar formation .
right on the back positions I find the crew very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the S@@ V @-@ dor@@ fer S@@ V mainly imports from the high north .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ reading , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ ar@@ hus ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; it will be difficult for us .
you also need good luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for the trip to the far north is convenient .
his debut in blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e jan@@ four .
while the Ch@@ allen@@ ger Tournament not currently manages the Bundesliga match in the Italian Bi@@ ella play event , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) played at the tournament in the Czech Li@@ bere@@ c C@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) for his first use in this season .
the previously un@@ defeated Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik Castillo was yesterday with the Weiß@@ r@@ ussen An@@ drei Vas@@ il@@ ev@@ ski in the ATP tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
he should be in Kiel but also like Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ ow@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgium Julien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories on the last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ k@@ z could also move back to the team .
enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was the number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , a man from the train@@ ee at Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay fills the cad@@ res .
how America can harm the O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump not worked , on Wednesday evening his signature was put under the law on appeal of sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his H@@ ast to adopt the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave the Congress a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ constitutional law &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ amed the US defeat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the design plans to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pipeline in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correspon@@ d@@ ingly , investors of the native O@@ MV , together with other European companies are co @-@ financed by the construction of the Russian Ost@@ se@@ el@@ eit@@ ing Nord Stream 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dr@@ y@@ cul@@ isse is tremendous .
however , it may be too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , thus the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump should also have to raise the sanctions as an Executive Order to life .
there are twelve weapons to vote .
&quot; the press &quot; has looked at which the group could defend and which really hurt him .
the s@@ quad@@ rant season 3 trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Car@@ tel is placed in the centre of Net@@ fli@@ x .
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ ke Killer reveals itself , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not yet over .
the seasons three and four have already confirmed the streaming service , the first got its first tra@@ ilers and showed the latest ar@@ cs of the show .
in the third season , DE@@ A has raised its attention to the richest organisation of the world &apos;s drug traff@@ icking in the world : the Cal@@ i car@@ tel .

Rolle in reverse : the city presents 46 kitchen hel@@ pers .
the city organizes the K@@ ita @-@ lunch again .
with fixed contact partners for the children and assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back into the urban day@@ care centres .
as of September 1 the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the possibility of eating in the urban kinder@@ garten ( Kit@@ as ) again in their own ar@@ ous@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , assistant conductor in the department of youth welfare , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the house is still cooked by the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and has been freshly cooled down .
the town operates in the Kre@@ feld area 46 day@@ care centres , in 44 children get a warm meal at lunch time .
in the past Kit@@ a@@ year 2800 children sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have not only eating children who are served 45 weekly hours in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour supervision if children stay up to 14 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 Particip@@ ation forces from 1 September kitchen service : they heat up the supplied food supplement , supplement the salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give food out , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a k@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two groups as well as sevent@@ een units - decides on the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ per belong to the K@@ ita team now , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz content .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much stronger , and it is easier to implement and implement fully ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for that &apos;s why it concerns : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; children should help to prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita rooms - so far the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , has also the charm finding it in the cost @-@ equal to the city as the most economical for the city as the most economical way it is from the press office .
and this , although 46 sub@@ time forces are set new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours do not fall so strong with around 750 persons in the education field , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ om , acting head of the UN Mission , said that hundreds of women are ri@@ di@@ aries in the provinces . three women are ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ated for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ stated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be really representative and cre@@ dible if women are in@@ restricted and included in all parts of the choice process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial Council and the Presi@@ dential elections take place on April 5th .
the Taliban issued threats against an election process associated with the transition from international mar@@ tial artists to an advis@@ ory role .
this year elections for the first time will be given the power peace@@ fully by a demo@@ cr@@ atically elected government .
Hay@@ att said , a strong role for women will strengthen Afghanistan &apos;s democratic success .
the Afgh@@ an independent elec@@ toral commission reported that 1.2 million women were registered by registered 3.6 million voters .

G@@ MB concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to contribute to the production of the Bis@@ c@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie over the long term commitment to production in their plant in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that companies were silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the work , which presents other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea cookies .
in the last couple of years , Mc@@ V@@ ities said that he invested more than 5 million pounds over the last few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first experience , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s branches of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s asked to express &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns about financing for moderni@@ zation of production lines will not be pre@@ prop@@ elled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ ard , concerns our members deeply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have been working here and working forces focus heavily on local community and the Glasgow , an important pillar for decent jobs in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , under the prosp@@ ect of jobs , wage and prosperity , and in the background of the Bre@@ xit , rising cost of life and chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urg@@ ently need a flour@@ ishing presence at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesperson from Pla@@ dis said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Fili@@ al@@ ite at T@@ oll@@ cross has recently received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond to our employees and trade union representatives yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ ard , where some questions were discussed openly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we discussed the staff that we operate like all the companies engaged in an extremely competitive and reliable business climate and we constantly check our business areas - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds , especially in production lines and operating improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility and completely . should our business processes be changed at the site , employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
is the PS@@ G Barcelona warned of three years ago ?
the page of La Liga is your interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti rep@@ ent
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not aband@@ on in its persecution by Ne@@ ym@@ ar after placing an offer of £ 189 million in order to resolve its outdoor use clause , but did it war@@ ns to Barcelona three years ago ?
the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , Ne@@ ym@@ ar will become the most expensive professional player in the world and for the highest @-@ paid pro @-@ sports@@ men of the world . PS@@ G has wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious over the way that Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced his way outside the Catal@@ ans , although a source near Catal@@ ans has always been his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned of the PS@@ G @-@ President three years ago ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club , who wanted to sign the best player from PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not worried , because they touch one of our players , then we will contact them in opposition , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have passed this line , with the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G clearly made that they would not allow it to travel from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing any of their price for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would serve the pre@@ stige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would like to express its deepest regret on your own under@@ age or based on the wrong estim@@ ation of the occur@@ ren@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , the Vatican Conference &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seemed to crit@@ ically that during the coverage of violence in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ estic Spar@@ rows &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; concerning the attacks in Regensburg , no one had to be prevented for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful deeds &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; degree medi@@ al manipulation , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the acc@@ ust@@ omed to design@@ ate the Catholic Church as a source of all evil experience is already a part of everyday experience and is preparing public opinion that goes for normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , Für@@ st@@ in Gloria of Th@@ urn und Taxis played an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one likes to go to the church and this is a lively fres@@ co@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , she pointed out that in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pun@@ ches have been quite normal educational means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with fre@@ aky children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would be un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports of mis@@ use cases , Pope @-@ Bro@@ ther Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also appeared .
completely wrong , author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ es@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the findings of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is the 440 @-@ page report presented by the di@@ ocese of Regensburg and the En@@ lighten@@ ment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ cy rows were killed between 1945 and the early 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of assault , 67 Dom@@ spe@@ ople sexually ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; summary , it can be held together that by Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
the punishment for the pupils could also fall more fier@@ c@@ ely in Emot@@ ional Emot@@ ions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , unlike many other acc@@ us@@ ations , many victims also rated the general humanity of R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases even have positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , H@@ es@@ emann declar@@ es , as the report report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 pages report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inci@@ dents of violent exercise in fe@@ asts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; there is a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ en@@ sch@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many students bring forth his &quot; humanity . &quot;
secon@@ dly , it appears also as Chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who has been using the Ö@@ f@@ teren if a new album was musi@@ cally no top achievement .
how do you evaluate this report as well as his biograph@@ er ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : if you read off the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself rather why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all .
only eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of the medi@@ al or sympathy in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the geography processes at the pre@@ school occ@@ ured outside his sphere of action .
one can pre@@ suppose it , too late , or first clari@@ fications have not taken seriously enough .
the Dom@@ en@@ atz@@ illa Sec@@ on@@ dary school on which he worked , was perceived by practically all those question@@ ed - as literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus also the vast majority of his student Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also describes it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warmth , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sin@@ c@@ ere &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as extremely goo@@ d. teacher , who provided the boys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always derived from grapes of children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its extremely Emot@@ ional Emot@@ ions , which also led to so@@ dom@@ es .
that he threw himself not only with chairs and threw the key@@ chain on the floor , but also ear@@ cra@@ cks , and too nau@@ gh@@ ty guys fell on the hair or ears , he gave himself to deeply regret , and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
however , to his honorary salvation , however , such correc@@ tive methods in question@@ able time , 1960s and 1970s were widely used , with parents as at teachers .
do you know even such breeding methods ?
of course , I think each of us was born in 1968 .
I have also experienced that in a world@@ ly school , a state school .
compared with what actually is in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the ge@@ wal@@ lowing eating at the pre@@ school , they are b@@ az@@ ing Bag@@ at@@ ellen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one asks , if it is not to do with his fame and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , a lot of media has just crashed on him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Bavarian Pope , there are many who never understood him , still fri@@ ghten@@ ed .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , the report was reported very much about the topic of mis@@ use among the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ spe@@ spar@@ ks .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger put your burden or involvement in regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entru@@ sted to the Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to speak with my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a common representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embar@@ rass@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem during the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of sexual abuse has happened and is , however , that most of the cas@@ u@@ alties are silent .
if they trusted not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , certainly not a choir master , who would certainly have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do you judge the j@@ ab pads of R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in the abuse of abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a question@@ ed student says it : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he would have had such knowledge ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have been the respective perpet@@ rators .
I think it ... also for really absurd that it is reck@@ oned to him ... Bu@@ bs in@@ tru@@ sive and clear@@ er or rather re@@ opened as opposed to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ u@@ tives , confidence teacher etc .
to talk with him about sex ... - in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that compl@@ ying with the employer and / or their environment , could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore exemp@@ t from any party .
this way it cannot be disc@@ arded ; it cannot be prevented or sent to ad@@ vert .
therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name to these contra@@ dic@@ ated crimes , as it occurred in some cases .
in the media , there was much of &quot; Ge@@ der@@ tex@@ z@@ eating &quot; at the mon@@ ks &quot; mon@@ ks .
the previous domain master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thrown into the report &quot; Weg@@ ner . &quot;
do he have to live with this repro@@ ach ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem in the coverage all mixed and bl@@ ended up to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and Ge@@ ov@@ tex@@ z@@ eating and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly a mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is therefore clean separate : between the school and the high school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ spre@@ ader &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; between sexually abuse and ge@@ ck@@ ety @-@ eating as well as we say again , other pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , the report deals inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir director of the Dom@@ spe@@ Spar@@ rows . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole aw@@ ful test education , the cases where boys of sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers were down@@ rig@@ ged and mal@@ ign@@ ited and among them were incur@@ ably , then all@@ es@@ ied on the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have been ruled .
but with them , Dom@@ en@@ caps@@ ulated George R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do because he only got the boys on his face when they were already at the Dom@@ spe@@ ar Sec@@ on@@ dary school .
on the contrary , as most of the witnesses were em@@ brac@@ ed , the subject of &quot; pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u .
they were only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and much even &quot; heavenly &quot; conditions .
what was different on the High High School ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there was discipline , but not sa@@ dist@@ ic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many sacrifices were rated as many victims and therefore even have positive memories with him in numerous cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , at most , the alle@@ g@@ ation remains to have gone away .
however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods , in which it was reported by the conditions on the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the events at a school where he had not worked and responsible for himself ( so the witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again around 1993 .
shut down Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into the ears in front of the stands ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the gymn@@ asium , who even reproduced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out this way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre@@ school the examination should continue to be practiced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the risk of negative press release , he recommended an urgent action .
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed in Bavaria as a reference method .
before that , they did occur in a legal gray area , as each one of us knows yet .
it was hard to estimate for him , where suffer@@ ers may be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dram@@ at@@ ised , and where really the ad@@ missible limit was exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say , he would have gone out .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 , the test term for schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Für@@ st@@ in Gloria from Th@@ urn und Taxis ruled that it was un@@ fair to apply the current educational standards of that time .
how do you see it ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we speak histor@@ ians about the &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger of the past according to today &apos;s moral standards .
the princess has quite right .
but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ om@@ in@@ able at all times , and also not for what was broken in pre@@ school at in@@ war@@ dness and violence at inno@@ c@@ ence of inno@@ c@@ ence , which goes far beyond that then .
it &apos;s all horri@@ ble and I &apos;m glad that it is finally getting stopped .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means to discipline and punishment , so earrings in the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was forbidden , it has also been held strict about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his Regen@@ sberg was Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , as in the discussions with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the subject of Prü@@ sent@@ ee also available to language ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XV@@ I. tells of his perspective , since the Dom@@ spe@@ spar@@ rows played a key role .
nevertheless , however , I don &apos;t conc@@ eive that he carried a strict regime there .
but this also has to be said : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without which un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably hardly be possible to form an institution of world tran@@ g , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition that went right on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone one makes no big singer and every success , right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming .
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger on the talks about their book ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : through work on the book and beyond that , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger and always experienced a wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic , deep belie@@ ving and heart@@ y people , from whom you could not imagine that he could do something like a fly .
I am regularly discuss@@ ing how many former dom@@ ites still keep in touch with him , 23 years after his retirement , visit him - he is almost blind - and he is almost blind - and he will treat him as a member of her family .
those who are not forgiven him until today , that he was strictly speaking to them , are clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ estic spar@@ rows are thank@@ ful for him to en@@ rich their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he always was a good , pat@@ ern@@ al teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly that may be - but still a lo@@ vable respect , to which they still look up and honor them .
and please , once again clear : all that is presented to him are correc@@ tive methods that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be happy that we have long overcome this time .
but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to become a medi@@ al sin@@ ner .
there is the evil intent that stands behind it , only too obvious .
the report that was just released was reli@@ eved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the ris@@ er would have gained a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has gained great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps nobody &apos;s probably know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ spe@@ Spar@@ rows , finally in peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
