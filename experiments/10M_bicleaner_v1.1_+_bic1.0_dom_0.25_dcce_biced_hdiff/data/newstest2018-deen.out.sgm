<seg id="1">Munich, 1856: four cards that change your view to the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit chapel, which is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Peasant gardenies economies the erstwhile of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card coin supports exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It gets nervous when maps are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows everyone who had to stumbled herself, because the car-Navi was showing a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historic maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of geoportas Bayern of the State Government, are all others but actually very illuminating.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">It becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the wider area of Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayatlas is a Flickepark which you do not know as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the great overview map for cities and municipalities, more detailed maps, so-called primal power sheets, were incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying management between 1810 and 1864 and solidify the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader worked in Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Finally, when the French troops entered the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801, there were today's neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern District.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max IV Joseph advanced the project, founded the "Topographical Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian government office.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Ural University for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found as all others on the Bavarian State Library website.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "the comparison early / today is the state capital of the most impressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The town has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is an inferior to occur relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was born 21 years after the construction of the map, in 1877, in Munich's district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, sub-sendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of sub-spirits are concentrated around the today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the Bavarian farmers in Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing as fields - at first glance: at first glance, a small-part map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten entries from the so-called 'Urals', derived from the basic tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">Today, small plots are still not farmers anymore - but a gardener to the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area distinguishes north of Unsendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810, became the scene of the Oktoberfest, was in the 19th century a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand side of the Isar gives the historical map a glimpse of the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to the 'Au-Haidhausen district, you can not only read the street name at Gaston "or from the hill" on the air "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. "</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here on the Auerfield street one once locked people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">There was in 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle-Irrenanstalt "erected at the Auer Lünen."</seg>
<seg id="34">In 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden accompanied the establishment of a psychiatrist that was brought to death by King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was advanced for his time and ended for example the chains of the so-called madmen." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he is prohibited to use the personnel to apply violence against the passengers, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen museum which has worked for an exhibition with the Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients had been at first place, and later extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circle of cycles in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatry, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the premises of the former Auer Anstalt young people are now encounter in the Munich Salesian region.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the complex of buildings in 1920 and was converted into a youth hostel with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is located west of the TSV Munich east, East residential buildings dating from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, we built the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" - in architectural accustomed to the origin of origin of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during World War II during World War II.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as" "" "main square" "", "the merchants called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change was also in the heart of the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allied forces broke down many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">Until now, a great stay - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business buildings and a Gruftapel from the Middle Ages stood at the Marienhof where these days were to work and the Spatenstich will take place for the second S-Bahn stations.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich-map can be compared with the aerial view of today and filling the hole in the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Civil Code published Travel Guide for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Faroureds issued a warning for coloured people who travel to the discriminatory policy and the racist attacks of the state of Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which will come into force by August 28, 2017, invites you to bring special attention to visitors and Missouri, as a number of fragmentary, racial ractions in the last time localities and here," says it in the statement of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently approved law of Missouri, who makes people more difficult to discriminate against discrimination, as well as the prosecutions of the state, the disproportionate of minorities, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of the civil rights that happen to men." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped or killed because of their skin color, they are gathered or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such a warning that organises the organization for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">The Group itioned incidents like racist abandoning against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under fragile circumstances in the beginning of the year after he had no fuel during the journey through the state and convicted by the police of Missouri, without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "the Council also pointed out a recent report from the Office of Missouri, a recent report which is shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than whiteness." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of their families, friends and staff about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be ready to bring it cheers or let the relative know that they go through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri reported 100 assay assaults in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI report which entered the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th level of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, while the United States immigration laws had pledge to confuse people because of migrating issues, which will contribute to the view of ACLU to further race course.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings is usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of other countries, but lately, stakeholders have employed the action as a reaction to certain laws and trends in the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">Decaunching project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fishbacher-Faun project is a success project and will continue throughout the next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestal-contained Peter White and Kordula Kovac have provided an image on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the legal backyard of the family Schwendemann remembers of the fisherman CDU-village association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann retains insights into his operation in which he farms 55 hectares of lawns and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many kitten and also houses in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"Schwarzwaldmilch is" for him the alternative labour market for milk of its cows, so swdemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste you only comes to regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as it is also the BLHV-chairman of Fishbach, he described the refill project as" elementary "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't work on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area, a lot of work, can be processed with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and the topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the responsible operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it has no biooperation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune recognized the meaning of the decauntory project and is glad to promote leader." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">For the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euro per hectare, farmers need to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">It was hoped that the afforestation of surfaces could be moved out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operation," "" "stressed the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism for the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">Over the course of 2013, a total of 25 parcels were fenced by eleven participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure area is thus 40 hectares, which may not be opened up to at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half about leader was promoted by the total costs of 71 500 Euros, a quarter contributed to the village of Fishbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained in charge of 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of faun.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do not have a good job, without farmer and country women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White it was fixed: "best food is produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">State Regional Landscape (LPR) Baden-Württemberg, the state subsidies of welfences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to preserve the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The presence of a subsidy received by the LPR is the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the fenced area cannot be bad (hangar above 35 percent) and must thus be threatened by reafforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The application of eight participants with 24 plots is currently running for the fishing calendar year 2018 which would like to build roughly 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The disclosure area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">It is the safest sign of a regime change, when it start to attack statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">Americans highly appreciate it like any other - therefore the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the company's company in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the keys-ideologists of the Trump-regime, certainly knew what he did when he did a symbolic 'axe in a heated battle with Jim Acosta from CNN's proposals on the drastic way of migration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boathery and Liberty-Imiters would have suffered him when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he grabbed its importance, and in particular the importance of being attributed as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta testified, "I don't want to enter a complete thing here, but the Statue of Liberty is... an American freedom which shines the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to, was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is basically right, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "it's about the contemporating words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state invites not only an old immigrants, but the arms of the poor:" "" "your rubbish, your arms, and your pressed masses, which are longing to breathe freely; / the grieving of your wealthy coasts." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "drowning refuse" "" "was better on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict on the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who tried to place their words after her death at the base, knew very well that it was a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republican ism by showing the feminine embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And they are themselves a very different name: mother of exams.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link of the link with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people wanted to change from the right wing this long.</seg>
<seg id="118">The large writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is that the American flame will bring to the murdered world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not shine through the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">This is quite unusual, Limbaugh can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was in it to see them as they were of the exhausted, eldest, but hopeful people after long and often awful journeys on the deck of ships was seen.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is the true sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective, the Miller and Trump ever wish to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not shine forth the way, but hatred, which is their only source of power, ignite.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black lounges Scottish members of the team from Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers at a time when only two villi belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"" "the performance director of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-man Scottish quota of world champion" "" "will make a massive contribution to the team." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the guy at the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidate, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butler - who are competing against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m circuit, while Eilidh Doyle was elected captain of the team.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their captain speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a series of athletes, whether they were Scottish, or whatever they live or practice, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought quite naturally, was great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">"" "the Commonwealth silver medal winner, which will compete in its fifth world championships, says that it is" "" "incredible" "" "that 16 Scots are in the British squad." ""</seg>
<seg id="145">The best total number of athletes in the world championship were seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>

<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5000 m of runners.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman who was looking for a great season with the victory at the British Team Trials and the 30th Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers their first World Championships as the only other Scotsman on Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the club captain says that they are" "" "enormously proud" "" "on the fact that many of their countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases also with medals and finalists." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">"" "" "" "to be so special because of the team captain's capitalists, it is because it was a great honour from the other members of the team, but to know that my team-mates voted for me, and voted for something special for me," "" "she added." ""</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I am very proud of all the shallots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to go on podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">It is therefore really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are back in the Olympic stadium.</seg>
<seg id="159">"" "I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="160">Block articles on Facebook: do not work for a public office if you cannot tolerate the heat of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from a bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of all, from Domestic Policy up to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He was unsatedly at critique, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not have his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington said," "" "The freedom of freedom can be taken away - and, dumb and dumb we will be led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on it, more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan employees have blocked and delete contributions of at least 450 people and expressed their opinion on its official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">This is why the American Civil Liberties Union defendants him in the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff called the lawsuit as frivol, and the online commentary was full of a counter response with "Na," and? "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it's especially important if there is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in a overwhelming democratic state, which is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">It has the second highest acceptance of the 50 governors in the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary stimulating head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has a fixed hand on the leadership of his state and strict observance of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to join his voters and make his haired head to chemotherapy in his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"" "therefore, the blockage of persons who come to the Governor's page - which is considered officially" "" "- the public forum" "" "and employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary, and ultimately dangerous." ""</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson on Amelia Chasse did not argue the actions of the governor and argued that the comments of comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spamming or hasserted people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people who have been blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And they are just real people who speak with their leaders, a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor gave the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani by Bowie, MD, was not filled with water but she asked for assaulting.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current news," "" "she wrote in the comment field of the message" "" "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="190">"" "" "" "it is much cleaner than in previous years, if one had done the same thing, employees were sent to gather newspapers with critical core articles and to burn and burn protesters or to silence." ""</seg>
<seg id="191">But that just happens digital.</seg>

<seg id="193">President Trump is accused by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feeds.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell in Virginia last week.</seg>
<seg id="195">The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County put together the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they put a voters from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevan (R) received a visit from ACLU due to its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so heavy.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable Portos had a similar effect to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers precipitated between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous mailouts hit his lead.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">People who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Belorarius" and "Portius," wrote all the letters to newspapers, the Washington's decisions.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years St. Hilarius church: on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Bergkirche the old cemetery-area in Tumlingen will be invited to Serenade on Sunday, July 16th at 16.30.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether his idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hilarius facility a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth benefit-serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">Rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of tumours.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasises: "it is a unique dörn small gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Wuerttemberg Urcustomer for the first time: count Hermann of Sulz and the Vogt "on Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, on the Tumlinger Berg, beside the former parish church there was also a royal court that belonged to the church or the patron law, not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">There were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"" "as from the description of the" "" "Oberamtes Freudenstadt" "" "from 1858, in addition to the subvillage and the Oberdorf, which today in the village of Tumbllingen are still visible, the" "" "Mountain" "" "is the third one of the village councillors in the village." ""</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around the year 1600 underlines these historical events.</seg>
<seg id="476">The Patronatsrecht originated from the early medieval Eigenkirchenrecht.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who had built a church, continued with a pastor, remained the owner of this Church, and could also inherit it.</seg>
<seg id="478">Thus the right to use a pastor or to propose the bishop a new pastor.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The bigger one of them broke at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell was then lost in 1692, but had to be handed over in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows of the windows were scrapped and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 the French troops came to the vicinity of the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used it as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remnants of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from the listener.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year of 1834 a storm arose the church tower and half it crashed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the existing tower-value still remained as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem is taking the Hilarius facility as successor to Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>

<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she authorized the architects and design studio Duck & Shed from Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill that had 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to life for yozanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms overlapping, so that the architectural challenge in it was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>

<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window looks down through the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>

<seg id="1391">If yes, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico partner reports that the new staff of staff is planning to restrict the information flow to President Trump - including reports of the news media - in hope to hold the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, on his first working day with Lead employee, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump White House who wants to repair himself: bad information that advised into the hands of the President.</seg>

<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump does not broadcast.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his collaborators have done it several times to keep anger from him, their efforts were worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently hindered it, that trump control causes causes.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem exists to put together people in a White House, which are competing for competing parties, and again attempt to present their own agenda by promoting Trump Material, which possibly promotes his views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico partner - which deals with this story - told in May about the preference of advisors, to bring about doubtful information to the President for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react to negative press cuttings, especially with a corrupt leaks, and to find out from where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when somebody charged a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocalist Charles C. Johnson, who accused the alternate rod of Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a heap" from the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was banished from Twitter for lack of Twitter or that he does not have any concrete evidence, or that he has voiced in the past and revoke them.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>

<seg id="1519">In the western Arctic the gigantic iceberg has dissolved itself from the almost seven-fold greatness of Berlin from Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was shared by the Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar- and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The climb over a trillion tonne and 5800 square-kilometres big coloss drive now to the north and probably will take two, three years until it melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">It is with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest icegiants which have registered in the last three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">A danger for people is not coming from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To what extent climate change has played a role in breaking the iceberg is unclear according to research.</seg>
<seg id="1525">But overall, however, there have been a series of unusual outbreaks in the region for around 30 years, writes the US research centre for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this can be connected with global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The Brothered Koloss had so far been a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It is therefore constantly growing into the sea and breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the head of the antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this sword was the balance of waxes and collapses some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete makeup may be disintegrated there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot of evidence that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, as the front edge has never pulled down so far as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate standing under tension and can be disintegrated if a piece of a key is broken.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of schelfeis and iceberg does not increase the sea level since they float on water and ice the ice as much water as it yields to the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of a sword will lead to flow straight into the sea and flow faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">That could possibly increase the sea level, but only in a limited extent, the British research project indicates the observance of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the four-largest shaft of Antarctica according to AWI data, which is almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">On the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick, at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">It breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although there is a natural history and does not have any direct link to climate change, the Eissign is now in a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the start of records," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">"" "among scientists, whether the Larsen-C-Scelfei will come back again or in a long-term, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" "" "our models say it will be less stable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last for decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Although these researchers have not attributed to the demolition of this gigantic iceberg not on climate change, however, in recent decades, many ice wineries of the Antarctic Peninsula have been dismantled.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long summits of Antarctica strives towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The temperature increase has contributed to the decline.</seg>

<seg id="1777">Mordillo was temporarily one of the most published cartoon illustrator, the Knolloun of his figures are its trademark.</seg>

<seg id="1779">His message: laughing, "for there is too much sorrow in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist he struck himself amongst others as a draftsman for greetings cards - what frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the most happy day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he said once.</seg>
<seg id="1783">"" "following stops in Lima, New York and Paris, at the end of the 60's breakthrough came with the release of his cartoons in" "" "Paris Match" "", "and then also in the" "" "star" "" "and other leading magazines around the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">The artists of cities are always inspired again.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, roundish Mordillo figures in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning he is still sitting at the animated character today, and is working almost ten hours daily.</seg>
<seg id="1788">About calendar, puzzle, books for Gross and Small, T-Shirts, Plushes and Watches also find many spread worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1789">For six years he has been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with its figures.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The main person in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos favourite animal in his drawings that has a thousand-monkeys as a counterplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1791">For the first time his figures speak in the 3D movie, which should come to the cinema screen in 2019.</seg>
<seg id="1792">"I don't know what they are saying, it's odd for me," says Mordillo.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender of Provence threatened by climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">He has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is due to lack of conditions due to drought, and because of the disease, insects and farmers are trying to find solutions to find a big headache.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, an expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "the lavender of lavender in Provence was effectively dangerous because the plant has resulted in much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cycade, a microbacterium, the Zwergzikaden transmits, and with very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And it stands much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender drops not only for vacationers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of very long plant clocks with a huge number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either underminated or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have less parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered in consideration include a better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation out of soil, but also the spray of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties, which are more resilient to dryness.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a reporter underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly Riodce normally meet in wednesdays in order to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa, through the organized crime, corrupt civil servants and unceasing drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists are discussing what feels safe: they should take their children to the office, who were the goal of an attack with grenades, or let them go home in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponent, neutral, ally.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask reporter to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and compassion.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the secret list of government or cartography, a catalogue of criminals that make chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no escape period of violence, and during the whole country the bodies often accumulate, and in December 2012, President Enrique Pena Nieto has held his office in December 2012. 589 are standing by attacks and threats under Bundesschutz and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries.</seg>
<seg id="1818">The latter is the publisher and her inspiration of riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be journalist," "" "Valdez, in one of his numerous books, wrote on violence in the context of drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His lack is perceived deeply, although its presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows its medieval finger with the word "Justice" hangs at the facade of the Riodce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, bear t-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or its typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters discussing their divided topics, the trauma, her nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a UN Attorney General was established in 2010, in order to process the cases by journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, it has only instituted two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders, each year linked with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely tried in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodce they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting, though the terrain is still traverse.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of security is little benefits, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to spend my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we know not the reason, we stumbled all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced by his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfth River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The support went away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there's virtually nothing at the theme of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the extradition in the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlesions of the country, because rivaling factions were struggling to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa anyone can be shot any day or more people on the road or that the cemetery is full of enacted, two-story mouse mausoleums for drugs. the larger are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "remember for a minute that there is a state of" "" "peace" "" "if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of riodoce, is broken with the blame that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of February, there was the publication of a interview with Damo Lopez, a leader of the rivaling antitrust fractions in war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication might have been annoyed by the sons, constructive gangsters bought each copy of the issue, once they have been delivered to newspaper heap.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was to force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same history, leaving the country at its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined the company with five colleagues to the establishment of Riodce and sold 50 US dollars of shareholdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, it was impossible to operate journalism without toast to the robbery problem, "said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">With the time, the newspaper earned a reputation because of the brave and honest coverage, and recorded sales and advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it to publish hard tread investigations without fear of censorship and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that nobody dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the creation of Riodce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" prestigious award for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuit of the Mexican drug history, wherever it was.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily, he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ-Award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa, "said a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV in October last October.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you have to take the task that falls to you as a journalist - either the or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I would not want to be asked:" "" "what did you have done about so many things... why didn't you say what went before?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodce-Team tolerates Valdez, the fun bird that could curse the friend who was generously with hugs and ratings, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, going and sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now ask: was his love for routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they do their work best, and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it, if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home start and country roads," to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-dressage and self-keeping.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">When it smells bad, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, said the publisher of the Riodce Andres Villarreal that "odor is a sense that can be duped... and then the thing is happening with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules as he and others say that in Sinaloa do not apply more - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggles, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees of Riodce met for security training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. days earlier, Spyware, which is only sold to governments, has been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen sought protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Riodce in a four-storey building in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the shear, some of the reporter, whether these officers were among the 50% of the policemen, who described the governor itself as not trusted.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporter went into the mountain scenery, where the drug bound is de facto control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodce has led to three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There were the assassination of the former well known Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They had also a posthumé to the public spending, focused on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite locally run by drug traffickers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter heard from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the ruling Institutional Change Party (PRI), which ruled nearly all the century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI Governors have been accused of high-carcases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">In fact, Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman did a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, the readers used the column by Valdez as the best known source of abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its slender body stature.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez is dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers who have been protesting against the murders by journalists, because the employees have never expected anything they had ever expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez rubbed a few characters and went next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to the Office of the Office.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its own.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In the whole country journalists have become a loud voice as they wrote in organized protesters "SOS Press" on walking trails and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez left in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">In a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and killed it because they have said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has asked that she is postponed by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has hurt their objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez again said that journalists in Mexico organised crime, involved government officials and an equal society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-Journalism" he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug trafficking, but also on orders from politicians and security forces involved in organised crime under a blanket.</seg>
<seg id="1896">"" "the Media Group" "" "Articulo 19" "" "has allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials in the past year." ""</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "" "" "in Mexico you die because you want to keep mouth," "" "said Ramirez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the killings have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forget the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macia in the northern border of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found together with a notice that was supposedly signed by the Societas by Kartell: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and earphones lay in addition to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to rule, like El Norte newspaper in the northern border of Chihuahua, following the murder of the correspondents MIROSLAVA Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to make El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"" "in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug map with an editorial page on the title page" "" "What do you want from us?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled the country or even fled the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and search for dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they chased, as it seems apparently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, which was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="1909">For those who keep back and continue work, there is a daily dance with cracking decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trafficking him terrified.</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico is going to Hell, and so I became reporter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="1912">At midnight, last Friday, when the last issue was finished, the editors of Riodce sat on the sidewalk before the office and trans beer when all their telephones started to summed up.</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of sliding paintings with bandartful and security forces close to the bathing resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war escalated further, as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.</seg>

<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to expose the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) to uncover the thrill.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all these hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"" "" "" "if you blink a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," "" "said the main author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrell Museum where the creature is depicted." ""</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go down to the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found out that this plant carnivores, although it is covered with an armor and resembles a changing tank, probably at risk of carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from craven, and used a parachute technology that is also used as counterpart, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This could have been allowed to mingle better into its surroundings and deviate from its enemies, experts say what it suggests that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year old creature from the family of the Nodosaurs family has made headlines in May and is now shown in the Royal Tyrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Borealopelta Markmitchelli according to the Museumbrician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7.000 hours in making it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible by Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of scales and makeready to document his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">It discovered the counter-shady, a widespread defense method in animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creation was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Though the counter-shady is common, the results are surprising since the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "" "" "it indicates that the dinosaurs was driven by sufficient pressure through flesh-nivorous dinosaurs, that the evolution of the confrontation of the confrontation was favored as a means of survival." ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of contemporary animals who use the counter-shading - think of deer, Zebras or girdle - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey, which signalizes that this nodosaur was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predatory behaviour on a massive, heavily armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs rob of the crayon must have been," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur is bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal on information about his life, including its conservative Darfur, to find out what it had eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs died when he died, fell into a river and drove out into the sea, where he fell on his back to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was so warm as South-florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"" "" "" "this nodosaur is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with conservative skin, but also in three dimensions will remain, and the original form of the animal retains," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>

<seg id="1955">The chalk period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, which stood on two legs, crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived million years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of its terrifying ancestor.</seg>
<seg id="1957">The Acrocanthosaurus is one 38 feet (11,5 m) long, six tons heavier monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists who show their latest findings in Current Biology published in Current Biology indicates that Borealopelta was dispatched into the sea and mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the Museum it is the surviving dinosaur dinosaurs in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were average approximately 18 feet (5 feet) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes, mounted by its shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored marine mammals were sacked by the Western Canada until a flooded river drained it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaur preserves his armour in exquisite opening detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the crews still drew up bumpy plates along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is so rare as a lottery in the lottery.</seg>

<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to its core.</seg>

<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns leftly body that was stretched out on the road and stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that is wild," said Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new to them and for their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She moved her cell phone to talk about a tweet on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"" "there were photos of the police band and people who cried, and from a man who claimed to be Browns father's father, who brought a sign with the inscription:" "" "Ferguson Police killed just my unarmed son!" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2038">You booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After his landing at 23 o'clock she brought her 6-year old daughter from the house of her father, and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson at the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary movie, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">"" "" "" "it is a history of surviving and the protest, the love and the loss, the strength and resistance of resistance who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers." ""</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell ended with her daughter, wearing a floral dress and a matching crown, the two had a talk with her, that they had countless times before this morning, "over the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for them that believe in them?" "" "she reminded of what she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to be free to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I'm lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally experience no disastrous racism, she isn't unlike the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I have the feeling I would have a bad service to keep them far away. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police department, which became a camping area, when the activists on the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson waited.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local company partner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped to transfer them to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to embrace Ferrell shape.</seg>

<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Everything has come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, a co-director of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to document, "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question approached Ferrell:" "" "will you document or try to find a story you can utilize?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism has been nourished by numerous cases of people, often from white - in a community which benefited from their pain and resilience.</seg>

<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment was brought closer to Ferrell, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" over the years to Browns.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"" "" "" "this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. we are talking," "" "said Davis." ""</seg>

<seg id="2068">As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life, as they are in love and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said herell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I have understood that there must be certain vulnerability during this work and for the desertion of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells history repeated the role of the black gay women in the wider Black-Lives movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">"" "two of the three founders of the Movement, which have marked the film" "" "BlacklivesMatter" "" "in social media in 2012, identify themselves as gay people." ""</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and therefore we constantly fight at different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, gay women must bear the main burden of all. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to notice that "the movement really is held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it is said that "this is not a affirmative type of action," when Ferrell has been selected as the heart of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who stirred up this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it's no coincidence, even though it was on the front line because with a life at these cloaks as a black, gay wife is so much on the game." ""</seg>

<seg id="2080">The news camera in Ferguson disappeared long ago, but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to persist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is at parole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area they call their home: "a chaos."</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to megalomania: TV-reader over bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, even though it is not yet built for long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the east of the pedestrian zone has been outdated since the first presentation of 2009 the population in advocates and opponent.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold the topic hardly leaves one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"" "as the one to the bit gallery," "" "This would be a dream" "" "(Nicole Becker) or" "" "This would be really great" "" "(Nicole Schausten) from the other side:" "" "don't need a person" "" "(Siggi Bags) or simply:" "" "megalomania" "" "(Lars Scholz)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the advocates are planning to build more clients into the city, those other shops will also benefit, fear the opponents, that then the pedestrian zone explodes.</seg>
<seg id="2095">On top of this: the gallery is planned just on the grounds, on which the farmers market hall stands, in the 13 direct marketed its products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This will conclude with the beginning of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new construction - even for Beda square with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been able to buy almost every week in the farmers market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country always liked very much.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and above all after building the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also that.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct sales are settled in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">This should probably not be low in the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what shopping list for Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether apparel, Shoes, Drogerie or Supermarkets: I find it redundant.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One sees how many shoppers are buried here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">However, since there is not even a healthy weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the Markthalle remains.</seg>
<seg id="2111">For all the goods offered there is fresh, mostly offered directly from the producer and is finite cheap.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shop transactions are rented in a shopping center just by larger companies, for the local rents are often not portable for one retailers.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special shops there are almost no more and what is left will still disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fan: "a shopping center with a market hall does not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery doesn't fit for Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where should the farmers market go out during construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even for a duration if the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or will it already manage to remove all shops from Bitburg before, even before? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it simply won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center which is empty, no one needs.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my view, it would have been better to promote a right farming market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farmers market, yes, thanks to the insane many - as I find - futile construction projects in Bitburg do not place any more.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the farmers market are captured, a piece of culture will disappear again. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A perfect similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown that are almost unremarkable - hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were made by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg in Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts, which you have been sent to by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth of prison, where the former intelligence analyst banned a 35-year jail term after it had made diplomatic messages to the website of WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Reemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combine its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and seminal dissidentin whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama as he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which could look out from the 30 portraits such as someone with these genomic data - the many ways that can be interpreted and the inherent Determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had been talking about the identification as a woman since their puberty, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, among them six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grained, black-white self-shirt, in which Manning obviously sits idle on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde vig - which she has been associated with.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had just returned from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of strangers of forenic artifacts like cigarette stills and chewing gum, to extract the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look like.</seg>

<seg id="2137">And she could not visit this time and could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned murders became unequal epwounds that were exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"" "they even created a Comic" "" "Suppressed Comic" "", "which predicted a future in which the President Chelihaired might and it would be able to see the exhibition personally." ""</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was indeed only a few days after the book has been published, with his release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, a welcome kind of happy gathering.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the show something depth and strong, since Donald Trump takes a war against informants from the government camps and against transgender maids to find new, tweetering ways, which he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for a strange Timing of all these things, she told "things going to happen for a particular reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In an artistic statement on the wall of the gallery, Manning of her excellent signature (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) an end of "automated smashing, whose foundation has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousands of Cs and Gs and As, written in a pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg was hoped by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the high-developed scientific dictionary of the artist) how amazingly similar, at least in biological respects, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what we hope to bring about, that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how openly about genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories are to be seen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study asserts exactly the contrary: a diet that is rich in flesh-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition, which affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the people are usually advised to ease meats and dairy products, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of protein they contributes to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the gut are patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food are not to enter the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are unable to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and damage the body without damaging them.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When balance is too wide toward inflammation, it may result in an anti-inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was noted that a type of tolerance for the immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their initiates.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said, "We have a connection between the bacteria art - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbioma, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">It suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an intryptophan diet tolerant, less inflammatory boomination, if the same system also stands at people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoc researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan, examines a kind of immune cell that encourages the tolerance, when a group of academic studies had such cells, but a different group of the same tribe, which was accommodated separately.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It believes that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiomes of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, normally living in the gastro-intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of mice were sequenced DNA sequencing and there were six bacterial species found in mice, but without them in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were drawn in a sterile environment so that a intestinal microbioma was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria applied to the immune system, the researchers received L. reuteri in a liquid and then surrendered small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">Immune cells developed to tolerate cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned from the fluid, it proved to be a byproduct of the tryptophan-metabolism that is known as Indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers spread the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells decreased by around 50 percent, but when the tryptophanes have halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant producing cells such as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect us in our gastro-intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan auxiliary products from L. reuteri develop as many people as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote as these cells are inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophanous values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2715">The decision of the White House, a marine helicopter to fly to the South Lawn for one event, costs taxpayers according to the military, which were left to the TIME Magazine, up to 24.000 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as the Navy One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Chief Executive Officer of the White House, made a tour of products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter produced in Connecticut was exhibited in addition to a sail from Maine, a fireman from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, after the records at the South Lawn, after the recordings of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMx-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"" "" "" "I just wanted to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," "", "the Commander of HMx-1, on the eve of the event, was the Deputy Prime Minister of Aviation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2721">The message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17th at 7am, and so long stayed, until the lawn was vacated between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">Note that if departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limitation of service hours a second team would require a return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original flight crew remained at the helicopter during the event, while the security guards during the time on the ground remained at the ground.</seg>
<seg id="2724">The recording provided by the TIME was not clear, whether a second flight's crew was not required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids the federal government to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Data sets indicates that HMx-1 could ask if the event could violate the destiny.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question that we asked, was whether it was a violation of Brands Hatch and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.</seg>

<seg id="2730">But also official events have political tones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">At the event, President gave a violation of the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to permit government regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of the aircraft, known as the Navy One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon from politically beneficial purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But their use only for a photo operation is unusual.</seg>

<seg id="2737">HMx-1 crews often lead training flights in the region around Washington and South Lawn by depositing the US President at the White House with precise Zentimeters.</seg>
<seg id="2738">At the beginning of July when Trump was on the G20 summit in Germany, HMx-1 introduced 58 exercise landings in the White House.</seg>

<seg id="2742">A spokesman by Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved to put helicopters on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMx-1 does not maintain budgetary records for the presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">According to Stundaries of the Ministry of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D however amounts to 24.380 USD per flight.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of the unit list the flight time of the plane than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below that rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for the refund conditions is highly misleading," "" "said Walters." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">"" "" "" "these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funding." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2749">According to a RAND study from 2015, the doings for DoD do not contain the personnel costs, but also consider the cost of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract.</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Freiburg Domspeatzen report to the abuse of misuse was borrowed by Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the sweep scandal at the Regensburger cathedral supper continues to take care of discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weissener, spokesman for the reformists "We are Church," declared after publication of the German press agency, "said Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as of the former Pope Benedict Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"" "" "" "it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would like to express its deepest regret on your own underage or based on the wrong estimation of the occurrences." ""</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "on the contrary, the Vatican Conference" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "seemed to critically that during the coverage of violence in the" "" "Domestic Sparrows" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"" "concerning the attacks in Regensburg, no one had to be prevented for" "" "shameful and shameful deeds" "", "but the" "" "degree medial manipulation," "", "says the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee." ""</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the accustomed to designate the Catholic Church as a source of all evil experience is already a part of everyday experience and is preparing public opinion that goes for normal" "", "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "also, Fürstin Gloria of Thurn und Taxis played an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "one likes to go to the church and this is a lively frescoes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "moreover, she pointed out that in her youth," "" "punches have been quite normal educational means" "" "to be done with freaky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It would be unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports of misuse cases, Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take Georg Ratzinger into protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the findings of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the diocese of Regensburg and the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regency rows were killed between 1945 and the early 1990s" "" "with high plausibility" "" "victims of assault, 67 Domspeople sexually abused." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is called Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "summary, it can be held together that by Domenellmeister R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">The punishment for the pupils could also fall more fiercely in Emotional Emotions.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "" "" "however, unlike many other accusations, many victims also rated the general humanity of R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases even have positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann declares, as the report report on the misuse scandal Georg Ratzinger in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr Hesemann, the 440 pages report on the" "" "incidents of violent exercise in feasts" "", "there is a contradictory picture of Domenschmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">Many students bring forth his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">Secondly, it appears also as Choleriker and perfectionist who has been using the Öfteren if a new album was musically no top achievement.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this report as well as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read off the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself rather why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Only eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of the medial or sympathy in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The geography processes at the preschool occured outside his sphere of action.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can presuppose it, too late, or first clarifications have not taken seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domenatzilla Secondary school on which he worked, was perceived by practically all those questioned - as literally - "redemption," "Heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "thus also the vast majority of his student Georg Ratzinger also describes it as" "" "warmth," "", "" "" "sincere" "", "and" "" "competent" "", "as extremely good. teacher, who provided the boys regularly with cakes, biscuits and candy and" "" "always derived from grapes of children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and its extremely Emotional Emotions, which also led to sodomes.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he threw himself not only with chairs and threw the keychain on the floor, but also earcracks, and too naughty guys fell on the hair or ears, he gave himself to deeply regret, and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, to his honorary salvation, however, such corrective methods in questionable time, 1960s and 1970s were widely used, with parents as at teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know even such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think each of us was born in 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have also experienced that in a worldly school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared with what actually is in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the gewallowing eating at the preschool, they are bazing Bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">"" "" "" "one asks, if it is not to do with his fame and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, a lot of media has just crashed on him." ""</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian Pope, there are many who never understood him, still frightened.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, the report was reported very much about the topic of misuse among the Regensburger Domspesparks.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger put your burden or involvement in regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Domenellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to speak with my father or mother about it," "" "said a common representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem during the reconnaissance of sexual abuse has happened and is, however, that most of the casualties are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they trusted not even parents and siblings, certainly not a choir master, who would certainly have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you judge the jab pads of Ratzinger's role in the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioned student says it: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he would have had such knowledge (Georg Ratzinger) and could have been the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd that it is reckoned to him... Bubs intrusive and clearer or rather reopened as opposed to their parents, internatutives, confidence teacher etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">To talk with him about sex... - inconceivable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus, the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that complying with the employer and / or their environment, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore exempt from any party.</seg>
<seg id="2943">This way it cannot be discarded; it cannot be prevented or sent to advert.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to bring his good name to these contradicated crimes, as it occurred in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media, there was much of "Gedertexzeating" at the monks "monks.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The previous domain master Georg Ratzinger is thrown into the report "Wegner."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem in the coverage all mixed and blended up to a huge melange from sexual abuse and Geovtexzeating and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"" "it is therefore clean separate: between the school and the high school" "" "Domspreader" "", "between sexually abuse and geckety-eating as well as we say again, other penalties." ""</seg>
<seg id="2951">"" "" "" "moreover, the report deals incidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the DomspeSparrows." ""</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful test education, the cases where boys of sadistic teachers were downrigged and malignited and among them were incurably, then allesied on the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really scandalous conditions have been ruled.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domencapsulated George Ratzinger had nothing to do because he only got the boys on his face when they were already at the Domspear Secondary school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On the contrary, as most of the witnesses were embraced, the subject of "preschool" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">They were only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and much even "heavenly" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the High High School?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but not sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" "" "many sacrifices were rated as many victims and therefore even have positive memories with him in numerous cases." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">Thus, at most, the allegation remains to have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods, in which it was reported by the conditions on the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the events at a school where he had not worked and responsible for himself (so the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Shut down Georg Ratzinger into the ears in front of the stands?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the gymnasium, who even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out this way," "" "that in the preschool the examination should continue to be practiced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">From the risk of negative press release, he recommended an urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed in Bavaria as a reference method.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they did occur in a legal gray area, as each one of us knows yet.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was hard to estimate for him, where sufferers may be exaggerated or dramatised, and where really the admissible limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say, he would have gone out.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the test term for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Fürstin Gloria from Thurn und Taxis ruled that it was unfair to apply the current educational standards of that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we speak historians about the "pitfalls of anachronism," thus the danger of the past according to today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and also not for what was broken in preschool at inwardness and violence at innocence of innocence, which goes far beyond that then.</seg>
<seg id="2977">It's all horrible and I'm glad that it is finally getting stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger into protection because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means to discipline and punishment, so earrings in the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was forbidden, it has also been held strict about it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his Regensberg was Georg Ratzinger, as in the discussions with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of Prüsentee also available to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI. tells of his perspective, since the Domspesparrows played a key role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, however, I don't conceive that he carried a strict regime there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this also has to be said: without these perfectionism, without which unconditional discipline, it would probably hardly be possible to form an institution of world trang, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition that went right on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone one makes no big singer and every success, right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger on the talks about their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through work on the book and beyond that, I met Georg Ratzinger and always experienced a wonderful, humorous, basic, deep believing and hearty people, from whom you could not imagine that he could do something like a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I am regularly discussing how many former domites still keep in touch with him, 23 years after his retirement, visit him - he is almost blind - and he is almost blind - and he will treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who are not forgiven him until today, that he was strictly speaking to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domestic sparrows are thankful for him to enrich their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always was a good, paternal teacher - a stringent father, certainly that may be - but still a lovable respect, to which they still look up and honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clear: all that is presented to him are corrective methods that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to become a medial sinner.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that stands behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The report that was just released was relieved.</seg>
<seg id="2998">"" "" "" "now the riser would have gained a 93-year-old man who has gained great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps nobody's probably know the Regensburger DomspeSparrows, finally in peace." ""</seg>
