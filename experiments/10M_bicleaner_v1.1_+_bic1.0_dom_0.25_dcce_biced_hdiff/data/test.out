28 @-@ year @-@ old chef found in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef that recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local purchasing centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the brother of the victim said that he could not imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally it went uphill with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the body was found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall on Wednesday , as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ ic@@ ia from San Francisco ruled the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as a murder and the investig@@ ates are running .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia , shared the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco with that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston before six months ago had his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters Restaurant in San Francisco .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man by the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters said they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ cked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him , &quot; speaking the speaker .
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia gave up that Frank was first living in Host@@ els , but that &quot; things finally went uphill for him . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; he shared Louis Garcia the K@@ GO .
Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia said he could not imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly man with a great heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was always something to cook us with his family to cook us something to prepare the dinner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that lumin@@ ous every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has the information on the case will be asked to call the introduction of the SF@@ PD under the number 415 @-@ 575 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers .
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston doesn &apos;t always need to be perfect or successful .
that has made the Hollywood star in an interview clearly under@@ stand@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am always put in drawers , or resi@@ des from the outside label that have a little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ est@@ ly , these things are rather schn@@ u@@ ppe . &quot;
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh that it is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
as a gift , the actress spend their time at home , pre @-@ tv with lo@@ cker@@ ish cushi@@ oned and Mexican food , is called it in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they bring the question of the children &apos;s desire : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child game , &quot; A@@ ni@@ ston is a single mother to see two sons .
the film runs on the 25th of August .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the pyram@@ ids
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tur@@ ni@@ ers in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a little variety with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a first .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered her holiday , they pursued after the feeding trou@@ bles in the fast Gal@@ lop .
a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and then the riders ended up again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer from all time - 101 tournament victories - back in the vicinity of horses .
he left his family via the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he s@@ mu@@ g no way to photo .
long was the first time in Aachen and therefore at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid handed down the man from An@@ hausen into the golden sport pyramid in the frame of a small gala .
there is no evidence for awards to the symp@@ a@@ thetic athletes .
federal Ob@@ serv@@ ile , Silver Lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the Year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ owed him .
long is the 18th winner of the pyramid of sports pyram@@ ids .
in Aachen he met the first award winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; this award means to me a lot , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for she is not only awarded for spor@@ tive successes but also for social commitment . &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring .
and so he continued the money of € 25,000 in the same way .
with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ fold US Champion St@@ alli@@ on was induc@@ ted into the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports &quot; in Saturday .
among the excellent are the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Fe@@ wer Corn@@ elia G@@ ien@@ ger , the god@@ father Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the singer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ ek@@ e , the J@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the hand@@ shake of Erhard Gor@@ geous .
many of these sports cars came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part mig@@ rant Society immig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za Prize goes .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ ump economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - which is both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two U.S. Presi@@ dential applicants are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
the matter of the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doub@@ ts rather small in the case , and war@@ ns against the state of the economy - with taxes and regul@@ ar@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to control the economy and regul@@ ate death , he says .
by contrast , he would be quite different , claimed to have become a b@@ ump .
to reg@@ ain regul@@ ators , he will make for far reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private persons and businesses .
Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to fulfill , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged chances to open , and needs money .
therefore taxes for the rich would increase , they say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the m@@ oud , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost at the same time .
the democratic candidate makes even the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; governmental investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are refused by the nation@@ alist te@@ eth@@ y wings of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Tr@@ ump , there might be part@@ isan discussions yet .
the differences in energy and climate policies are more significant .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and up @-@ driven coal promotion in the US .
thus , oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris Climate Agreement wants to announce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , Clinton wants to strengthen and demand the renewable energies with its investment program : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will create the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even with international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ one trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time both US doesn &apos;t want to isol@@ ate foreign trade , but simply protect us from American jobs .
they should be paid more then , even Clinton is required .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger wage .
it wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , The minimum wage has to be raised , then he says he could not change .
but the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the taxation policy of both camps .
on one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to boost the economy and the citizens to boost growth .
his critics only keep him , so the budget deficit would only be bigger .
on the other hand Clinton stands that at least the rich wants to pay more tax , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs for women who flee alone , almost from everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traum@@ ati@@ zed .
a house provides sanctuary .
in a large kitchen we sit four women .
each one has a baby that is at most a year old .
one has put her little son in his arm .
he rocks with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother star@@ red onto the tabl@@ et@@ op .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and k@@ isses the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until you speak with Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is the director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social welfare services in Bavaria , and deals with the topic women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are wing@@ ed .
they live in Munich in one of the few dec@@ entr@@ al hotels for single @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs opened up the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich &apos;s Aid Association .
it has been officially opened .
there are 60 people living there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman that arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars , because they are politically persec@@ uted because they are tor@@ tured or death , or because their families will send them as hopes for Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in women persu@@ aded other reasons for the escape : &quot; many ste@@ aling it secre@@ tly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in their home , they have made experiences with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , slavery or forced pro@@ st@@ itution .
she continues it on her .
on the run this continues .
&quot; for example , to demand a bottle of water for a bottle of water is no rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believes that when they arrive in Germany as soon as they arrive in Germany , B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be considered as infer@@ ior and worst .
this leads to about 90 percent of women who live in the residential area of Munich are traum@@ ati@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not created voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so acc@@ ust@@ omed to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the living , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they are often not too busy , it needs more lod@@ gings just for them , calling B@@ ahr .
seven District governments in Bavaria are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question , whether from a similar project as in Munich , in its jurisdiction , some respond with no .
there is no such thing in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken .
even in Schw@@ aben alone , wing@@ ed women are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , pressing the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are in some communal accommodations or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations only for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also ur@@ ges that women have to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a study which was published for the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or men and women are accommodated there , can be - continually - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the shower rooms should be separate and accessible for women , stands in the study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much the women feel this need , you can in@@ quire at the rush there will be at the house in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since we have spoken about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
you could easily make a second house .
assist@@ ants strike : demands for new work amp@@ ires
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of the assist@@ ants have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new labour measures in their disputes regarding a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) demanded its entire Council , appro@@ ve more labor disputes from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC told that there would have been a minister to the concerns relating to the contract .
assistance and medical students have agreed in July on the re@@ jection of a contract which has been agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the Chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained &quot; troubled &quot; to problems , what led to the contract was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In this regard , the J@@ DC Management had agreed to completely reject the proposed new contract and challenged official new negotiations for all your wor@@ ries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Management Board today provided a formal motion for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of es@@ plan@@ ing labour measures that begin in early September .
the disputes resulted in the assistance of assistance for this year in six times , the first total sei@@ zu@@ res in the history of N@@ HS .
the leader of the BM@@ A Assist@@ ance veter@@ in@@ arians Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back after the election of the agreed conditions of the contract , back by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during meetings which still occ@@ ured before the vote of 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
following the vote , Jerem@@ y Hunt said that the contract for Doc@@ tors in England was forced to launch .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of Foreign Relations &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure , which ended a crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey came on Tuesday to give his hands and proc@@ laim an official end of the eight months of ongoing war of words and economic sanctions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when Vladimir Putin accepts his Turkish opposite bank in the g@@ ild@@ ed hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I do not forbi@@ d that Ankara wants to pay this recon@@ ciliation .
there was a blow , yes .
but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles were sh@@ al@@ ant and barely any warmth , even for its restra@@ ined relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Recep Tayyip Erd@@ ogan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly from his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report a whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
on the next day a newspaper compl@@ ained that Erd@@ ogan would have been advert@@ ised as it would never happen somewhat .
his enthusiasm seemed to tell me rather the opposite .
but Russia &apos;s President of Russia won &apos;t forget that Russia &apos;s state of state had nothing forgotten .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his quotes : the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ alled .
Putin told him and accused Ankara of being in his back .
it was even bigger as it was committed by a supposed friend .
the Vet@@ ro@@ en re@@ build will be difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the nation@@ ally controlled media held a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed like the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the acc@@ us@@ ations from senior officers , that Erd@@ ogan &apos;s own family have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which were controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has fought this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St. Petersburg the official message heard that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting only took place because Putin got an exc@@ use from President Erd@@ ogan , which he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ceas@@ e@@ fire are obvious .
Erd@@ ogan needed first and foremost all friends who he can get after he had revealed during a failed coup d &apos;@@ etat of nearly His Am@@ ber .
again terror attacks on Turkey also rock@@ ed him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially to ban charter lines which usually take several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel agents and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resumed .
they are counting on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
this week , the TV predicted fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists stay there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is ra@@ ged in the West because it respon@@ ds to power to power in power as weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the continued anger over the accession process of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke is to benefit from the cool atmosphere and decrease the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian President won a bonus in Ankara to claim a bonus for the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat in Ankara following a attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
it is a self @-@ understanding for Moscow , that himself has a profound fear of regime change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the summit meeting in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace in the sea made it possible Russia and Turkey which described me an analy@@ st once described , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alliance of Foreign Relations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : two countries coming from the west and are badly dealt with and now al@@ lied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the public recon@@ ciliation , there are still vast differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently announced the role as a peace maker , but Russia and Turkey support both oppos@@ ing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks both presi@@ dents on the press conference said they had@@ n &apos;t even sei@@ ze the subject .
the president of Turkey avoided deliber@@ ately to answer a question about its differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise it .
there is no unique con@@ sens@@ us about where a common den@@ om@@ in@@ ator can be found to Syria .
but after months an open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ asters than NATO member Turkey , it is certainly better that the two leaders are talking to one another .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to Scotland &apos;s guests
according to the Board of Directors of the Bank , the R@@ BS label should only be reduced to a back@@ office part .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for guests outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand joined the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
the bank has been dist@@ orted since then , when it had almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
in this time , brand str@@ ate@@ gen &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end consumer financial statements .
it supported international sport with millions of pounds at Sponsor@@ ing , by six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to the Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Murray .
but now it has decided to put more national stamps in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will be available for customers only in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the dec@@ entr@@ al head office and the stock exchange at Nat@@ to .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are others , smaller brands for the private customer business that will get more meaning - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WAN was inter@@ viewed in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire during a guided tour of customers and employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes a brand mark , as well as the brand that our employees will be employed , as we are now more to a bank of stamps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our staff will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer be able to continue its six Nations sponsor@@ ing , and that it will increase the visibility of the different brands in his Sport Sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop into the bank of brands , for how do we concentrate on this to make a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago , if we said we had to be a great bank for our customers and launched this brand .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3@@ .000@@ th profit at New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double with New@@ market , which brings him 3@@ .000@@ th profit
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3@@ .000@@ th British gain at New@@ market on Friday .
he bet on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction which is trained by John G@@ os@@ den , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack , with his second win at night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey which reaches milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Doug Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner of D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the le@@ ver when he re@@ covers the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two yo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s reached the milestone in the obst@@ acle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the pen@@ sion@@ ed 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a recru@@ iting career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the nine @-@ time Der@@ t@@ ysi@@ eger , had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 Kar@@ ri@@ er@@ es@@ ie@@ ge
Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey of modern times and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone , which only a few reaches before him .
it has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tic intel@@ le@@ ct who distingu@@ ishes him from the other in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans have been enthusi@@ ast@@ ically for this sport for years .
I said Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already scored 6,000 wins if he would not just be a weekend and big yo@@ ckey !
in the UK , Frank@@ ie has already attracted nearly 30 years of winner what is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical flying gar@@ mount
flying Flying Fin@@ ishes over Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was annoying .
a whole series of big tur@@ ni@@ ches gain , including his famous &quot; glorious Seven &quot; in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and was given a drug forbi@@ d .
three years ago he had difficulty in the beginning , when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ ying his branches and to return to his top form .
and he &apos;s not a long time at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said earlier that he wants to continue on competitors up to at least 5@@ 0,@@ ten .
Russia &apos;s Putin fires Chief of staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin made unexpected of his staff of his staff . Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a part of Putin &apos;s closest appointment of trust .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Repres@@ ent@@ ative for environmental and transport .
in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is that Putin has arranged the dism@@ iss@@ al Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Guard . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was the dep@@ uty of the 2012 Ivan@@ ov@@ s dep@@ uty , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
1972 in the Est@@ onian capital of Tallinn , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo .
on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later served as Head of Protocol and Staff of the Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the main task of the government to support your activity as a head of state regarding law and inspec@@ tions on the implementation of your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov has asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow Myst@@ eri@@ ous .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest rentals of Vladimir Putin and works as he was responsible for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff came back on his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only few of them are convinced - especially , just before the parliamentary elections .
so what &apos;s the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody currently know that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the official statement - that once , a man who once had been hired as a potential president on once to rev@@ ise the Russian environmental policy - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ ke@@ p@@ tic@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his remarks on Putin , who are quoted on the website of Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It &apos;s true that I was asked to give you this very complicated post at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - to un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented position four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presi@@ dium manager for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov did the post in December 2011 .
before that he was dep@@ uty prime minister and minister of defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , as Putin was chairman of the Federal Constitutional Service ( FS@@ B ) , he was appointed K@@ GB and was appointed Ivan@@ ov to his dep@@ uty .
when Putin arrived in power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted .
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become the second term president of Russia , as a third term Putin would blow against the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , nearby allies of Putin &apos;s , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before joining the President three and a half years later .

Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the project &apos;s £ 1.@@ 35 billion is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North deck of Que@@ ens@@ land Cross@@ roads with Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closing arguments of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; covers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 lashes .
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
Economy Minister Keith Brown stat@@ ely a visit on the construction site today and was one of the first to take over from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ land Cross@@ roads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all wit@@ ness@@ ing an art crafts@@ manship of a truly ep@@ ic degree in this project with more than 30.000 ton of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
in spite of the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the bridge between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a fin@@ icky activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
all in all , nearly 79 % of the total bridge height at their place and the last section of the deck is given today in Ros@@ y@@ th a Bet@@ ong@@ atory for the Deck , which means that the entire Deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to his place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first lock represents a significant milestone in each bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this fantastic project the clasp is setting up and deep ground@@ breaking .
after installing the last street cover and its connection with the northern tip of the north , we had to close the still existing gap on the northern or landing page .
this was reached by pulling the north fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ metres to the south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity .
mas@@ sively , as the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , approx . 6,000 tons weighs and with an inc@@ line of about 3 % had to be drawn up .
he@@ y@@ cles , as the toler@@ ances that the team worked , tiny - on each side , they were only a few millimeters .
luck@@ ily , everything went very well .
saving in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men still have &quot; happiness to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness even to life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck down 13 : 20 BS@@ T , after a crew watched the event at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had trouble floating in safety while their boat moved from their own power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and set the worst in front of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the lif@@ ebo@@ at station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds have spar@@ ked the boat apart from their range until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found at one bu@@ oy without life@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the lif@@ ebo@@ at station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lord Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were cast into the water were lucky to be un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat had a clo@@ gging of the boat , but it dis@@ b@@ anded by the owner &apos;s c@@ ots from the person who controlled the boat .
someone is aware of these men today .
seriously injured - a man face up his ex @-@ friend
a man attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
as the police shared yesterday , the 50 year old had given the key to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead , the soft Tab@@ s broke the clothes of his ex @-@ friend .
when she came into the flat , he sat down twice on her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured at hand and on the body .
the police could take the perpet@@ rators .
when the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothing of his ex @-@ friend , he called his mother .
he then em@@ brac@@ ed his sister .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother together with their lives .
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
so she went with her partner from the house .
on the road they met the ex @-@ life partner of the man .
when the two women saw the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old took his sister &apos;s side to his side and took his ex @-@ friend .
who is building cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Green Group : investors should now be much stronger than duty in future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick is going to lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the coming years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scope concept for living &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the next meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
first of all , it is about the question : who should actually build favorable housing ?
a provision is lacking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Christoph Viola : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : whoever wants to build on urban areas must be 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the affordable housing can however also be built in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the great forces in the town hall was , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do you want investors to build on private land ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build on such land at least 10 percent , but as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing development program , which will cost millions of money and still needs to be financed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem , says Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU would like to make investors very few regulations .
the left doesn &apos;t want har@@ sh@@ ness for investors .
regardless of what Brat@@ mann played a tighten@@ ing of the situation on the housing market .
the scope of action is implemented , which will ensure additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the professionals .
but the program is not yet complete : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
how does one compare the loss of further 300 favorable apartments , whose funding will be going on in the next few years ?
there will be 500 apartments alone up to 2020 .
to prevent that , as a social spokes@@ woman for Nicole Palm , they should now be purchased from the city .
also , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back into the price binding .
this is possible in the West City .
the problem can be solved on one blow .
because in the West city the end of the dead@@ lines run off .
around 1800 apartments could be returned there to the price links for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners to do housing companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of social bonds will be dra@@ stically increased in the West city again , away from the target of so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; carbon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no more concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens assume that there will be more movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; presi@@ ding Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a wide majority , the CDU must be on the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apartment is focused on more construction places for family homes .
but what does not mean that there could not be a compromise .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
that teen and child are no longer going to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time on monitors , in the last decade of many be@@ mo@@ ths .
at Pok@@ emon Go , it is about getting people from the sofa and be more active .
the time on the screen was at the beginning of the TV , then on video games and lastly on smartphones .
therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities are non @-@ connected with each other .
I go to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , a app which is based on the characters that first created for the video games in the 1990s ( later developed a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
as many phenomena of pop@@ culture , interest in the release of game in the US , Australia and New Zealand early July was something .
the market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by the massive demand that the server was over@@ loaded .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon shall have more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; in short , players with their smartphones go outside and look for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS as soon as they were once found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( above a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; captured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a generation playing the game when she was younger , joined the river and le@@ ap@@ ed for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the game has resulted in a considerable increase in steps which returns the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cardi@@ ology , an app for Apple Watch , which followed 35@@ ,000 users , distributed the Washington Post recently , that in two days after launching the game , the number of people followed , the number of people followed every day 30 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it simply looks the raw data for performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance campaigns to take care of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to be active from the sofa , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the sofa , because many public messages are boring to health and people come to look at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the importance of sports may not be judged .
those who exercise regular sports , reduces his chances to develop cancer or depression .
physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open , making them fun .
three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people even close new friends on the hunt .
however , there are also m@@ ür@@ rian toys , which must always complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk around a door .
what should it do ?
it has got a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fitbit activity could already follow our activity , they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be eased with time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games to unite the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ites in the real world and many people in hunting are becoming active , more active , f@@ itter , and heal@@ th@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates Gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ ns
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all that is immune .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the bar .
stun@@ n@@ ingly on the ground .
the whole line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in invented the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five , &quot; Mann@@ er@@ sk@@ at@@ ery , A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ a@@ woke producer Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American woman , Simone Bil@@ es points out during the individual campaign of women in the gymn@@ ast@@ ics of women at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ al is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who gains a multi @-@ battle title and overall the fifth , while it consoli@@ dates their reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears , when her final score was shown and her long journey was found at that moment .
this success makes it the same League as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps who have put their sports on new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years , 15 world medals , including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals , which said a mixture of amb@@ ition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ on told her that she had seen the best gymn@@ ast that I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it expected an last examination in Brazil , a contest that went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between it and a burden over@@ sized expectations .
not with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered as a dis@@ appointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man emb@@ racing when they have won gold and silver in the single multi @-@ time campaign of women in the gymn@@ ast@@ ics of Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , in the summer of 2016 .
Bil@@ y repeated the first medal on Tuesday whilst at the farewell party of himself , Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i has served as a break @-@ in .
although it in@@ sist@@ ed on top of its long journey to the top , never the future is planned , it is not really true .
part of her ground exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is ge@@ ared to Latin American music , which would match at home outside the Olympics in Rio .
it is not a co@@ incidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was adopted by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school trip to the gym , in which Bo@@ or@@ man exerc@@ ised , became the power .
since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost any more competition competition , a victory of victory that will stop as long as it desires .
even when Must@@ af@@ ina led light through two moves , the picture ble@@ ed .
Por@@ be@@ bar and Bo@@ dent@@ ures - in which it holds the title title - lau@@ rel .
she repeated over again at 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the pork side - and sat on the ground with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man gently em@@ brac@@ ed her as her En@@ der@@ g@@ eral - a pure form - and tears f@@ lowed on Bil@@ a shiny red , white and blue p@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision that they once described in their book , became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a depth of Must@@ afa went .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man chapel , which is called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; had a lead .
after their p@@ act , she cast up the audience of K@@ us@@ sh@@ land , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which was sometimes du@@ bi@@ ous .
as it concerns , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old twe@@ et has a very special significance from the out@@ set of this week :
police : 3 victims killed in mass mur@@ der@@ ings in the car
according to police reports which were published on Thursday two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl killed that were killed in one of the deadly attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ rators fire eight shots from a hand weapon , while he was on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police shared that the triple murder did not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ ship , because the att@@ acker didn &apos;t take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that were possessed by adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting was forwarded to a closer look if it is connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed and two were injured in H@@ isp@@ anic resi@@ den@@ ces within four months and two were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown n@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence they have led to the conclusion that attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized because of her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness shared the police with that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which was determined for an empty Pick@@ up truck in half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ gs and ensured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine room .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ zep@@ p@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves to sing , toys and , of course , his mother .
but as the least of his aging , Edmund Optics , the result of a genetic disorder , has nothing known about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought , I did not create that .
I don &apos;t create this .
I did not leave that .
what is not right at all -- certainly you have left it , &quot; she said .
her husband , Vincent and her , was told that , under certain circumstances , they may never know , that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they sl@@ apped him to institutional him .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I did not know that people still do , &apos; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to said .
Edmund can help with a help .
Edmund was able to sit neither sit nor cra@@ w@@ ling until his third year and still can &apos;t speak .
but it makes progress slowly .
he can walk with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the characters you like , &quot; Please sing me something &quot; out . &quot;
&quot; we bring him a string language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical drawing language -- she says . Edmund invented some signs by yourself .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the c@@ ic@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will influence life with the Z@@ ic@@ av@@ irus In@@ infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of an un@@ certain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not really know .
I had no longer asked for the forecast for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect it can really tell me someone really .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers from infants with birth defects caused by the c@@ ic@@ av@@ irus .
it is getting better .
you know they will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ alls , flood gives cause of rescue in Louisiana , Mississi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large floo@@ ding in Louisiana are imposed on the Governor , on Friday to call out the emergency . the whole Saturday falls over with more rain .
numerous rivers in the south @-@ east Louis@@ i@@ anas and the south of the Mississi@@ pp@@ is flooded their banks and threatened with severe floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported by the national weather service .
the Governor of Louisiana John B@@ el Edwards told that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the way to the communities affected .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a speaker for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the governor , told that the inquiries for high water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags repeated .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the village of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a floo@@ d@@ war@@ ring system is used by wide parts in the south of Louis@@ i@@ anas .
the weather service leaves that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall on rain .
on Friday , a Fl@@ ut@@ early warning system was deployed in the south of Al@@ ab@@ bia , while Mobile continues to gover@@ n the area of Mobile .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Louisiana , will achieve all lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood after the weekend record level .
the Met@@ ere@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flooded many of the houses near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a current down@@ ward floo@@ ding in Ascension is an danger , since the floo@@ ding rivers will flow slowly into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Ch@@ fa@@ v , south of the Mississi@@ ppi border line in Liverpool , Louisiana , arrived on Friday at 09.@@ 00 the highest point that was ever recorded .
rescue teams still added people out of the floo@@ ding water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Mississi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved by glo@@ ster on Friday .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that waters of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rises greatly overnight .
he told him that another step@@ son who lives in the vicinity would have warned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and ro@@ amed the water and entered in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife also said H@@ ans@@ ford that she lived in the 48 years in which she lived there , never seen such a rise of the river .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that he and his family members could have all the Dis@@ abilities and he would be the only one to swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ ba had saved all three in a military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster where they were staying until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had rapidly spread themselves &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; there were heavy rainf@@ alls , and that the authorities bl@@ amed evacu@@ ation assign@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , we reported an ob@@ server close to Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning from 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground has been fully @-@ su@@ cked through the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities asked that serious inci@@ dents and road floods have caused the rescue of inhabitants of their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , and they were cancelled in five school districts .
the C@@ BS @-@ affiliated station WW@@ II reported that an or@@ derly in tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa cat@@ ches up 200 houses .
the inhabitants had evacu@@ ated in two churches , which were now both flooded .
the ruler of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets , who were r@@ ins@@ ed from floods .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set to accommodate evacu@@ ated areas .
&quot; as soon as the water starts to leave , they will go back into their houses , &quot; he said .
in Ham@@ mond , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads closed due to the high water and are provided by sand@@ bags for the people who hope to keep the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; the last great flood that we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the municipal authorities .
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Mississi@@ pp , the emergency manager Rupert L@@ ess des Harrison Count@@ ys said that it is still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a hand@@ ful of houses on Thursday may be reported as flooded , but not been reported on Friday until now .
Keith Town@@ son , Manager at shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it is still coming . &quot;

I just cannot believe it .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared the broad@@ c@@ aster that he is likely to recover .
he would have supposed to begin the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in the town of German@@ town .
together , three men were shot : at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are , according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in a stable state .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who is found in a critical condition , reported the sender .
the other two victims did not find himself in the car and the police determined , whether one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators could be .
investig@@ ators C@@ BS Philadelphia agree that it seems that it seems to be a cr@@ us@@ fire between several sho@@ oters .
Pat@@ ron enh@@ ancers for assault rif@@ les , which were tra@@ ced back to different assault rif@@ les , rev@@ iled the crime scene .
it seems that it has am@@ big@@ u@@ ously traded for a prolonged struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the side@@ ways , seals found themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus it seems to have been fighting for several armed fighters who were very active &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said police squ@@ ad Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
no conclusion was taken and the police are presently re@@ viewing the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was taken by a Qu@@ ir@@ lä@@ ger at his arm as she played before her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .

why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine at the Women &apos;s Olympic Games in the Tur@@ ns and this is more than one reason .
first of all , I have been at every summer Olympics in 1984 and the USA had never been dominant .
and secon@@ dly , this team has three tur@@ ner , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who had been inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , which is A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Je@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ kin , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the United States .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and H@@ isp@@ anic cul@@ p@@ ic presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female Tur@@ ner@@ i an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this indicates strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they unexpected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ics suppliers .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who won with an individual campa@@ ig@@ ning event for women gold .
man member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we do not experience the tip of this sport , but that way gy@@ ms may not look out around the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it in the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic champion will only have four tur@@ ner in the team . besides , it is the last year with Marta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a train@@ ee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality looks so that Tur@@ ns can be a expensive sport and Turner at first place in private gymn@@ asts , which can be maintained by parents , for training , setup , travel and hotel costs ( for the trainer and their Turner and families ) .
the majority of these train@@ ers lie in weal@@ thy suburbs , which can support the business .
in these clubs , Turner will receive a total training and a long term commitment to families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both trained athletes since they started with the Tur@@ ning .
we need to be inspired to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie to enable a service and easily accessible train@@ ers .
I was set up for 20 years .
for my events we have offered free and affordable tur@@ nes in Harlem for more than 15.000 young people ( especially black and isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer high quality gymn@@ ast@@ ics to learn from this great Olympic sport and to benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind .
this combination provides life for life as well as for school@@ ing and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , who bring thousands of young girls to interest for the tur@@ nes and that &apos;s great .
it &apos;s so important to take part in the sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you , so many young girls are motivated by a different background to get their way to becoming healthy , strong and successful young women .
assist@@ ants would like to organize further strikes after Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts proposal rejected the proposal
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes due to the adoption of a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ alities of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 Assist@@ enz@@ in@@ arians , who tuned them in a choice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July , the plans have disclos@@ ed to introduce the Treaty to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and would be harmful to employees and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assist@@ ants are supposed to receive a new contract which contains changes to night and weekend programs to improve care of the times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A commission for assist@@ ants divided last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said to the proposed contract according to serious concerns , in particular that it will pass the current workforce of staff to handle all doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only eight weeks the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made progress and time runs out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts from the BM@@ A to the solution of disputes by discussions strug@@ gled to participate in the government and sometimes on a de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was the case of a saying that Jerem@@ y Hunt just made the last month that his door would always open .
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hunt must now act , lift up the vibration and wor@@ r@@ ying the concerns of assist@@ ants . &quot;
if he does not do this , it has made the assistance to do that they are ready to perform other labor disputes .
the last strike at the end of April saw an boost of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 sched@@ ules , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in order to grant doctors on the strike post .
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed Treaty with the function@@ alities of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A would like to pay a better week for the 54@@ ,000 Assist@@ ance Pro@@ sec@@ ts that are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of N@@ HS , asked for assist@@ ants to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour measures don &apos;t reach little , but already loaded teams and contrac@@ tors and prepare the patient , nur@@ ses and their families only wor@@ ries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past two months , we talked to the commission of assist@@ ants , and with the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries had a positive impact on the concerns and W@@ hist@@ le@@ low@@ ings .
the employer hop@@ ed that continuing positive involvement in other important topics - such as post@@ ing , flexibility in training , training courses and gender @-@ specific pay@@ load , such as serious the employer that the health education England and the Ministry of Health concerning the compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May were .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medicine , which can reduce heart attacks
thousands of cardi@@ ac patients are benef@@ iting from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , after the authorities recommended that more people are given for a longer period of time .
the South African drug Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repet@@ itive heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
this medication is administered 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stro@@ kes or another heart attack .
the N@@ ICE regulation of the N@@ HS has been suggested for a four years in@@ gest@@ ion to further reduce the risk of cardi@@ ovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE regulation of the N@@ HS has been suggested for a four years in@@ gest@@ ion to further reduce the risk of cardi@@ ovascular problems .
approximately 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and one quarter of it suffer another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the arter@@ ial walls .
when it falls apart , it can cause blood cl@@ ots that causes blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ solves , flow through blood flow and causes blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
individuals who had already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ ec@@ a , is driven by the company name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by reducing blood cl@@ ots .
the line design of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month dose of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with one twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ols Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Doc@@ umentation Centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons suffered a heart attack or stroke , often with des@@ patch consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively helps to reduce further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who had already had a heart attack .
due to a provis@@ ional recommendation of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand the treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from this .
the information about the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the guide design recommends no treatment which goes beyond this time period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ y lets const@@ ancy in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report due to corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ness has led to that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is ignored , like a devast@@ ating government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former chair@@ person of Sir Eric Pic@@ kles is en@@ acted by police , election ob@@ servers and coun@@ cils to have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ignored &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evidence of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; convic@@ tions regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former minister of Integration and Communist government , who now is an anti @-@ corrupt political motives , said that the police should be allowed to establish ab@@ rou@@ ds out of elec@@ trop@@ ines just to protect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; voters out of elec@@ trop@@ ics &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he recommends that voters should lead a certificate to prove their identity in elections .
at present , a voters must call his name and address .
the report proposes to remove not removable ink on the finger of a person if they e@@ mit their vote , to prevent someone twice .
W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls that the press should have more access to church documents and decisions of non @-@ official students or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for election fraud , but also the communist government is to protect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bro@@ ther@@ ing corruption and financial situation that it comes to protect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets presidential campaign in the east of London .
last year , a special meal court decided that the am@@ ig@@ ning Mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man had to be ab@@ rup@@ ted after one Lit@@ any of the corrupt and illegal pract@@ ition@@ ers of his bed .
the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in the cy@@ n@@ ical way , &quot; and that he had brought his critics with rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ al acc@@ us@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ask his campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis that it was the reli@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either du@@ bi@@ ous or the result of a desc@@ endant that someone else cho@@ oses someone else .
Sir Eric said that there were evidence for fraud in the whole country .
in particular , he expressed himself al@@ arm@@ ingly to the frau@@ dul@@ ent correspondence - when the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made various recommendations to clean the elec@@ toral system , including the offer of instru@@ cts to prove the identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as proof , pressure on the needy members of some ethnic min@@ orities has been exerc@@ ised , especially women and young people to elect according to the Will@@ ens of the El@@ derly , in particular Communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ographic or ban@@ iak , background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions such a behaviour would have been ignored because of &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beliefs concerning eth@@ nic@@ ism and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean@@ se the system , including the ban , that political activists work , to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , drawn by Ther@@ esa May in consider@@ ations , requires also tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the elec@@ toral list of immig@@ ration and social media purposes .
consider options to request voters in front of your choice .
not removable ink on the finger of a person , once they have delivered their voice to prevent someone twice cho@@ oses .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure they are indi@@ scri@@ bed .
a three year limit on request to an automatic post@@ age .
b@@ anning that political activists edit complete post@@ age and env@@ elop@@ es of correspondence .
the police give power , r@@ allies , to set up pol@@ ling stations .
a law change which reli@@ eved one charge because of in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation according to the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Act 1983 ) .
photographer offered in pol@@ ling stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the elec@@ toral stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the staff tend to asser@@ t that voters go alone into the elec@@ toral cabin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric reports on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ast@@ o@@ unding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets there is no criminal claim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ toral Court has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty , on the basis of a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was deb@@ ated due to a number of reasons - according to the high demands in criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the us@@ eless &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ controls &quot; of the Town Council &apos;s const@@ itu@@ ation departments .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court case in Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning signal .
our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of par@@ li@@ aments , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and conc@@ e@@ aled spreading of some authorities threat@@ ens this good reputation .

the team member of the US team at ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused an ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter when pictures on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star sc@@ ary .
in fact , the ar@@ cher received the mad@@ ness in the social media and gave it to hear that he had been heard since his childhood , that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I don &apos;t see great simil@@ arity , with the exception of the facial hairy , &quot; Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; he is a hand@@ some guy , so I guess it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoub@@ tedly come into the center again : the striking simil@@ arity between the British wide spr@@ inkl@@ er Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .

C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users that compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we de@@ pl@@ ore it that these statements were made and that it was made possible to broadcast them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers last night and ap@@ ologi@@ ze to our media in the social media .
to show one , Byron &apos;s comments are related to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ adequate and un@@ happy chosen formulation . Byron does what he said are very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald was ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to just@@ ify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was purpos@@ ed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the woman &apos;s floating stage in the C@@ BC Olympic programme , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I clicked on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot;
naturally there was no dis@@ regard , and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark swe@@ ars about woman who tried sh@@ am@@ aged under@@ wear in the middle of the shop
the buyer did not know where to watch , when a woman moved her clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she numbered as she looked inside her , she pulled out and put them back into the shelf .
she hun@@ ts further and tried four pairs of shelter in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ est@@ one , Germany .
the pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ est@@ one , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put it back to the shelf
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman tried under@@ wear , she recovered and left the business without buying something . &quot;
she said , &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot;
in the middle of the sales area she under@@ took a pair of under@@ pants out of the delivery , pulled her own shr@@ ink tro@@ users and tro@@ users out and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a little dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she removed the pants again , which you obviously didn &apos;t like when she put them back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other sub@@ tro@@ users before they finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything to beat up and down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to mind that she observed someone - or think about the person who would buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How to think that someone would take home pants , which had another person and were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I said , the staff tried to pull the garments under the sale , after she went - what &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate it to go home with a new pair of shelter and find out that another woman did her and did not wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident occurred on Tuesday 9th August at our branch in Folk@@ stone , consci@@ ously . &quot;

hit him with the knee in the body and rotate , while the att@@ acker is crum@@ bled from pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the run and move backwards while you judge the weapon on him .
for anxiety , which approach itself from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the line , grab the weapon and rotate it , so the att@@ acker cannot shoot .
shoot the weight at the same time and hit the att@@ acker on the chest , then flip the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards , and set the weapon upon him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video in order to see exactly how to make it Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that there is a saf@@ est in case of prey to your money - unless you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
travelling Ian Wright plan for a guide on the dirty places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller lodged an immune system and dig@@ nit@@ lex to a serious test - by sending some of the most poll@@ uted places of Europe .
the present@@ er and travel aut@@ or Ian Wright , 51 , from Suff@@ olk is sh@@ orten his course on a Euro bill , one of the rail@@ ing on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button of a train toil@@ ette and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system .
before withdraw@@ als of each object he used a L@@ umin@@ aire to show up and to show what it becomes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment described under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner strength &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brought some surprising results for daylight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea to de@@ ga@@ ze the button of a train toil@@ ette , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely dis@@ gust@@ ing , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen .
in his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright talked with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and about his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he dra@@ ined , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr Wright became known to test the in@@ ability of his Dar@@ fur by travelling around the world and ate in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally as well as wonderful things .
from public funds to train stations to r@@ ins@@ ing toilets of toilets , the task assigned his immune system defin@@ iti@@ vely among a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; he told the film : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child , I was relatively un@@ worried about what my health concerns and I put all things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms , and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was just committed to his reputation .
the only thing he was rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his probe sag@@ a showed a lumin@@ ance of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ omet@@ res of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to crash after their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ res was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have a lot of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial population at different locations like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the worst thing I have smell in a toilet , close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I will not lick it here , because it is in@@ sol@@ itary here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner strength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company stat@@ uses Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to really offer consumers really something new .
something that &apos;s fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we led mad bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings by doing that we were saying &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in intestinal health will become a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to place them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we managed to provide more information about it in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film direction , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me not say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tast@@ ed some of the things I need to lick it , as the ec@@ centric Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to le@@ aky and others , with which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we have included some of these dirty le@@ ak@@ in paintings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by the year 2015 , 84 percent of all survey@@ ed lac@@ tic acid bacteria , in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines , and 58 % said they had to use at least occasionally products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destro@@ ys Del@@ og@@ ation social homes in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a as@@ ci@@ fied family left their social house after a delay in the amount of £ 50.000 , because she had terror@@ ized her neigh@@ bors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ aun Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were ra@@ ped out of their property , sho@@ cked employees found their property in a ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls have been ring@@ ing holes , wooden panels were flan@@ ged , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was decorated on the walls .
the family moved and it is believed to be now living in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer to repair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I am the view that people must not live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is thought to be considered not so beautiful part of Corn@@ walls .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , who had lived in the dwelling and the police said that the terror which had joined the family , street fights with bas@@ eball bat , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking , drug traff@@ icking and floods included .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement of the social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which will be torn down under circumstances , old mos@@ quit@@ oes was found
they were traded in the estate in which drugs have been traded in the past drugs .
neighbours said they had to fight on the road and to go regularly to the police .
her partner , Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing led her and her partner for@@ mid@@ able this week after she gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to expand voluntarily .
the Del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ing neigh@@ bors who said that their life was made hell .
one said , &quot; They listened to anybody . &quot;
we lived 20 years apart from them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood on because it was so peaceful - we are not lived there !
now where they are finally away , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have dreamed to co @-@ operate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called regular basis for 20 years .
on the site of the village house rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame to assume any responsibility for their behavior and to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family as a delay always the last step is to consider the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extremely important , and they had to look terrible for her neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community , which came bol@@ dly on us and have given us the information we have done .
I hope this development will give birth to some neigh@@ bors , and the message convey@@ s that ant@@ is@@ cial behaviour is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but they are all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , which is left behind in one of the bedroom of the house after del@@ ing the floor
workers from the house administration are now able to have rub@@ b@@ ish branches that surround the house
in 2014 , the police led a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as f@@ ather@@ less , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ ore and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine , after she pleaded guilty to the possession of a drug of a class B in trade .
they claimed that money for a gra@@ vest@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who arrived in a car accident in 2013 .
after being left without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation at Plymouth .
many rooms of the house were gra@@ ffiti with gra@@ ffiti .
police says that she will not gover@@ n ten@@ ants , who do not stick to the house rules
Angela Cro@@ w by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall shared the Del@@ og@@ ation a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not comply with the assignment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about those who have be@@ having their own behavior without compl@@ aining and to those who were damaged by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ national behaviour that continue to collabor@@ ate with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal transferred to panic after a ti@@ fying military jet crowded
sun@@ an@@ be@@ ter in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their life
a portu@@ guese plane P @-@ 3C Orion aircraft of the Air Force has an incredible nos@@ edi@@ ve trip .
air forces believed that it was on a training flight , but persist@@ ed that no security risk preferred
this was the moment in which sc@@ ary tourists start to panic after a striking jet still freezing over a full beach .
dramatic video recordings shown as the military aircraft flew almost in close proximity to the sun@@ an@@ ges on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the tourists sc@@ ram@@ bled upon them as they under@@ stand@@ ably started to make worry about the noise of the ge@@ aring plants without seeing first , which came through the clouds on them .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many tourists who post@@ pon@@ ed the video about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It flew twice very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was stor@@ med . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ uno Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane falling down upon me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro in panic were moved , when the plane came from the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese air forces employed today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3C led Orion aircraft on a training flight , to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and thus had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker told that the jet still flew a little deeper than usual , due to the bad visibility , however , the air@@ men persist@@ ed that the safety was at no time at risk .
area fires have destroyed those summer parts of the Portuguese mainland so that four people came to death on Madeira island .
today , the Portuguese air forces convinced that the pilot had to fly through the conditions - strong fog and bran@@ dr@@ ons - so deeply to limit its perspective
the plane was on a training flight , which the pilot of the pilot had to identify as part of the exercise

also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andre is missing .
the German suffered a change of blo@@ om in the knee , improving the demand for Bar@@ ca at least in favor of Claudio Bravo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er Ste@@ gen slopes in Barcelona have been around the status as number one for two years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coach Luis En@@ rique finally abandoned such a clear decision and made Bravo in the league , but T@@ er Ste@@ am steps in most of the remaining applications . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the first mandatory game of the new season , there &apos;s undoub@@ tedly over the fitness level of the team that was hum@@ ili@@ ated in a test game from Liverpool at 0 : 4 on Saturday .
even at 3 : 2 Li@@ on@@ el Mess@@ i and Co. in the rehear@@ sal of S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia were not really convincing .
Sevilla again took the 2 : 3 defeat after length@@ ening in the European Super@@ cup towards Real Madrid and moves the second triumph during the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
so far , Barcelona is so far the record winner of the record winner .

the last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic team was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ er Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left to the top left alone , between the sentences and time @-@ outs they had no co@@ aches .
they had moved back on the grand@@ stand and left their cas@@ hier at a fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mat@@ ches until now I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for me , &quot; Z@@ hang had said .

Ma had really strug@@ gled with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent to really fight in the first sentence .
after that he set the pace on the top and left the slope for a total of 13 points .
due to the su@@ peri@@ ority of Ma , this did not develop the expected boun@@ cing match .
however , however , there were more stunning ball@@ ads to be seen .
Miz@@ j@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his quarter final , the white E@@ tr@@ us@@ can was drawn up against the German Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . thereafter it was in medical treatment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had to settle down with sheet metal . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Donald Tr@@ ump grants ″ immense problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , also in traditional conservative states to make their majority .
parliamentary candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave a weakness of its campaign in the rep@@ ubli@@ can strongh@@ old of Utah .
a rare moment in which the multi @-@ lane and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire reported something like concerns correspon@@ dent .
once he threw 16 ri@@ vals within the rep@@ ubli@@ can camp , the doubt now grow to his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump from evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for assistance in important states as Ohio , Florida , or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the false report about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resumed his famous media f@@ ade .
rep@@ ubli@@ can pride sh@@ aking
Utah is normally a secure bank for rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ ard from June of June , Tr@@ ump and his compet@@ itor were led by the demo@@ c@@ rats , Hillary Clinton .
other institutes look for@@ b@@ ump , though not with the distance that is common to rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates in the federal state .
Arizona and Georgia also applies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview of the CN@@ BC &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The CN@@ BC &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on the question as he wanted to stop the crowd of Clin@@ tons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as I did it so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if left : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t make anything else as &quot; telling the truth . &quot;
if it was for him in the end , for the reasons for political correc@@ t@@ ness , that &apos;s ok , Tr@@ ump said .
then I turn back to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party of Tr@@ ump is said to eliminate funds to support his campaign , he should not present any better re@@ mun@@ eration .
instead of becoming the candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans for the Congress more and less than the arms .
Olympia : turn@@ key Sc@@ am at D@@ oping test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the occasion .
Ken@@ yan athletes is threatened after the second d@@ oping affair with Rio de Janeiro &apos;s un@@ common practice .
after an attempt at d@@ oping control in the Olympic Village Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee was involved in setting up a Dis@@ cipl@@ inary Commission to investig@@ ate the case .
a Ken@@ yan command was told that the former Sprinter and today Coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , took off an Ur@@ in sample under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported to the Team leadership of Kenya by D@@ oping control .
the IA@@ AF world @-@ connected the IO@@ C for information on the case to adopt its own exam@@ inations , an IA@@ AF speaker announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an evaluation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in a IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the d@@ oping control station and signed itself as a F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the sample posted and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Kenya &apos;s chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the ac@@ credit@@ ation of athletes who stood on the list of training controllers in the world anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was in 2015 in Beijing Championship @-@ fourth over 800 meters .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics leader Michael Rot@@ ich has been sub@@ trac@@ ted by the Rio Olympics .
he shall be informed of AT@@ oping tests for money @-@ pay@@ ers of his country .
according to media reports , he should be arrested in Nairobi at his return to the airport of Nairobi .
Kenya has been rel@@ ying on the IO@@ C to numerous d@@ oping associations for a long time under special observation .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 D@@ oping destination controls in front of the Rio Olympics , un@@ typically used earlier athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted at the targeted visor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had put a lot of pressure on African country in Brazil to create a Anti @-@ D@@ oping Law and a functioning control system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before Olympia @-@ start .
as a result , the WA@@ DA has taken Kenya from the list of countries whose d@@ oping control form must be provided with the WA@@ DA rules .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
in a series of tel@@ ev@@ isions of the ARD , we were again acc@@ laimed that in Kenya &apos;s d@@ oping funds were easily accessible and there will be a substantial ment@@ ality of the sports fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und asked for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he did in the Russian field of athle@@ tics .
in this type of sport , it could be proven to be used nationwide and system@@ atically .
Russian athletes were now excluded from the summer playing .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ Year the Salzburg Festival explo@@ res the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
this makes a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins master@@ piece .
the artistic director , Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and met with the role of Mary a youth room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Symphony led by the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ avo D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ un music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays a bit older than Maria .
she reminds us of her beloved with Tony , while the younger lady plays and dance .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first , because she is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then Mary &apos;s personality would be .
she says it in her song : &quot; I do Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I @-@ Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
it &apos;s so smart , of course nai@@ vely , and very passionate .
&quot; it looks very similar to me , my Italian character , whom I have as a Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with .
she is a very generous man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an unusual artist and passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rig@@ ating is a necessity for him .
you see it in every one of his moves , in his looks , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , this is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this piece it is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , we took the refugees , then the offer@@ tory cans moved to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them .
they are the same topics , and they are just as meaningful as at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousand of thousands of protection from Turkey in Germany , if the Erd@@ ogan regime continues fighting the min@@ orities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had de@@ pri@@ ved Kurdish high bur@@ ners with imp@@ et@@ tions , 500,000 Kur@@ ds have been fle@@ eing within Turkey on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the passing p@@ utsch there are still sec@@ ular and opposition ethnic Turks .
many will navigate again in Europe if they are going to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that occupies himself refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the military leader compl@@ ained the targeted sett@@ ling of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ ev@@ itic cities .
Erd@@ ogan thus wants to increase the transfer pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradi@@ cated or explo@@ ited in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also the CDU member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government asked that the Federal Government was &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ ogan and his followers . &quot;
a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erd@@ ogan @-@ critics also occur in Germany too .
I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also feared the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and opposition groups .
the fire mark@@ up as Gü@@ len followers are destro@@ ying teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; who does not suit and Erd@@ ogan , sits on a packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and Sec@@ ular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reported on calling on figures of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks set out the largest group of asylum in Germany because of political persecution .
for the reporting date 30 June , this 11.@@ 386 people and therefore have been almost 29 percent of all recognized as as@@ yl@@ ated ( 3@@ 9.@@ 625 ) .
in this survey , not the before war , poverty or mon@@ ot@@ el@@ ess@@ ness erup@@ tions .
asylum claims according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. , by the state page , individually persec@@ uted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; then go where it does we@@ aving &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the indigenous people don &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign - and the tourists from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia shall not select the Diet .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
the country elections are not once again held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Heavy Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
aside after so far it does not go : summer holidays , heat and land setting - that bit@@ es itself .
the natives , who are to be persu@@ aded by the bal@@ list@@ eners , are on vacation .
most tourists who are in the country are on the road , on Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the country &apos;s day .
practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters hang up , air ballo@@ ons infl@@ ate , fl@@ yers and end up voices , only need to wi@@ pe out .
until the 4th of September 2016 , the election and final holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to leave the right of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern once more of the people over the day .
the first phase , if you can say that at all , has just started .
and it also concerns a little : Prime Minister , Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU .
exciting is how strong new@@ com@@ er AF@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of coalition foods .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old , and heads of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from its large posters .
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes rose and ch@@ ats a little with the people as it did even his legendary kar@@ mic predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , sailors got cold feet and gives chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel at the aston@@ ishment of the AF@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of the right sp@@ lash , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU , with its nickname , the interior minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced as it is , if one makes a wrong time at the right place of election .
she has two chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel invited to major reports ; Angela Merkel is in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compl@@ ained Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary of the CDU of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , just in NDR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise the Nord@@ ost @-@ CDU would largely avoid the usual choices on market conditions and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ llas and ballo@@ ons .
this , so Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ate role . &quot;
the Union also noted that you are crum@@ bling the base in the country that it must be very strict , to find a wire to the people .
you are like the left , the SPD , the Green : in the ties of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CDU campaign Kok@@ ert on his fel@@ lows however is also self @-@ exposed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must go to where there are people : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , each birthday party must be explo@@ ited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is standing on the game , Sell@@ ering established its SPD for a particularly dedicated election campaign .
in surveys the Socialists and Democrats were at last with 22 percent behind partner CDU ( 25 ) and only close to the AF@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 , the SPD had still clearly gained 3@@ 5.6 percent before the CDU ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , might be able to put the jump into the country &apos;s day .
they make a modern virtu@@ e from the holiday @-@ need and impos@@ e its election campaign largely on the Internet .
&quot; online election campaign &quot; is the president of Claudia Müller .
otherwise green elections are taken on track search for local stimul@@ us among tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t just with a house@@ boat ride through the m@@ ec@@ cl@@ en@@ ese lakes and finds it even nice .
their impression : &quot; elections in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Re@@ furb@@ ishment : restaurants suffer under blocking
at the speed of speed with which the B 27 is renovated , there is nothing to complain .
for the leaders of the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end only around 20 o &apos;clock , there are all praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they made all pretty stub@@ ble , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet petrol station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a super team .
there is no default .
the construction site could be moved on the weekend to the half @-@ time according to the south , until the end of October , everything should be completed .
the opposite is also comm@@ ended for the construction works , approximately if it goes to the furnishings of comfort entran@@ ces .
since the construction site was moved to south on Monday and also the barriers of the Asp@@ erg@@ y@@ way in O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen was abol@@ ished and the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is once again , the traffic situation is relaxed inside the place .
the citizens can now drive from O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen to the B 27 on both sides .
the travel traffic due to the place seems to be back .
&quot; there was partially considerable dis@@ comfort , &quot; says the principal manager Florian King , responsible for the transport management of the rehabilitation .
the residents of Bach@@ straße Street , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many roads searched and more familiar to their Nav@@ i as the sign@@ age .
what led to that many truck stops in residential areas .
since the velocity is not observed , the community called for the measurement of the measurement out of M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was considerable trans@@ gres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King who made himself a spot on the situation himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there have been two to three per minute to be met .
the fastest speed was about 77 hour kilometers ride in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved on , however , it was qui@@ eter .
for business people at the B 27 it is just a little consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg now the street is open again .
in the cards , business people do not hesitate to consult .
but that the B 27 restoration of them led to sales gains , everyone , whom one asks , can look through .
however some more and some are affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; thus produced for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has hardly consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum slight decline , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also a fact that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sp@@ litter is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of them are explo@@ ited along the local road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , former crown , finds obvious words .
that is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not just him , but all the places I have made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil were missing .
we must be happy about every euro sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he divi@@ des the revenue reductions on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the street an@@ arch@@ ing has thrown its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to dism@@ iss half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , the policy would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt was respon@@ ding to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner if there would be a financial compensation unless we benefited from the advantages of the location at the B 27 . now they also have the dis@@ advantages which are due to the restoration .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other country circles , where a little more generous was handled .
in all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
after all , the family business has been settled since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history .
that other regular guests now have less frequently ob@@ s@@ led due to the complex traffic guidance .
if you can &apos;t drive , it is also wo@@ ken somewhere else .
that his regular cli@@ ent@@ ele came back after the refurb@@ ishment , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doub@@ ts .
despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction on his cli@@ ent@@ ele for the greatest crisis that has experienced his restaurant in their long history .
six months of construction , which is brutal .
constantly , the name of the terror attack is scre@@ wed to laws .
following the recent proposals , Minister of Interior de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick safety package .
but what did a Dul@@ ce status have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partners say about this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
all of his proposals are politically acceptable , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior in the Presentation of his new security package .
they over@@ took anyone .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also ins@@ ulted me too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Minister of Interior is on the results and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; att@@ un@@ reachable con@@ sens@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the latest attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère passed a little while before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but now they are all the more extensive .
some is known , announced , addressed that a new security authority to take care of the cra@@ ck of encrypted communication is not new .
even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nor the fact that Germany must implement multiple EU requirements to flight data and weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly .
finally , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second starting point for proposals which have not been doing so far : he wants to set sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ bs with double citizenship to the German pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dre@@ aming the CDU man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he kept doing this anyway for reasonable and demanding , whatever the coalition partner did not have a chance .
a few new ideas also presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they partly have in itself : it plans fast moving processes for dep@@ ort@@ ations and more possibilities to arrest people from dep@@ ortation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees who are targeted specifically in the country are to expos@@ e their smartphone in advance and open social media accounts for a safety check .
at Dul@@ ce for exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to off@@ end some even worse than so far - such , off@@ ences or deliber@@ ately throw away their documents to wear their identity .
some of them is political and legally sacred .
some also works un@@ equi@@ po@@ urs and leaves questions open .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does it actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère says it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics refugees and terror .
but it cannot be expressed in detail that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
many people in view of the high refugee camps were concerned about safety .
and things that the people are deeply involved , did not escape again in the campaign period .
the inner safety is enorm@@ ously placed in the focus .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the lock is great .
and yes , there are elec@@ toral competitions .
the Union and the SPD are increasingly focusing on inner safety in position .
in recent days there was high between the two parties .
only a gar@@ sty dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then over a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , in which the R@@ ess@@ or@@ chie@@ fs demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère we@@ ars also here to reconc@@ ile sounds .
he doesn &apos;t hold anything from a double pass from a double pass .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
they seem to be new , don &apos;t make sense .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he had constitutional objec@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his own package is const@@ itu@@ ary at all corners and whether it really is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for the coalition partners , only needs to be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot of things in what to do for conflict .
the SPD too , however , is trying to pro@@ filing on the topic of inner safety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; parti@@ ality Sig@@ mar Gabriel first carefully sign@@ alizes the read@@ iness to talk and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still passing through Volkswagen .
despite the diesel engine the deliveries are off worldwide .
but not in all markets it works .
on the call@@ back reaction , ver@@ tex gives us a concept .
Volkswagen k@@ icks off in the second half of the deliveries .
Europe &apos;s biggest motor@@ home can continue to mark a plus in spite of its many brands and thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ run markets .
but in July , the VW Be@@ e foc@@ uss@@ ed primarily in Western Europe and imp@@ acted the sales of sales as in the D@@ ax @-@ not@@ ated company .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars .
in Western Europe alone , China is the second most important market , sales increased 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market of Germany the deliveries of supply decreased by almost a six @-@ meter .
Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann &apos;s brand management led the weaker figures from July mainly on two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , in some core markets , I have given an economic recovery to &quot; changing economic conditions . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote stra@@ ined the withdrawal from the EU , compl@@ ained a speaker .
in the U.S. , where the exhaust @-@ driven exhaust , is also escal@@ ated , continues to book a minus .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the affected person stamp of the Lower Saxony continues to wor@@ sen@@ ce through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an exemp@@ tion of 0.9 percent is sold to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
Group CEO Fred Kap@@ pler was able to further display its outlets from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered up 1.3 percent more vehicles in this period , around 5.@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manip@@ ulated technology with a software .
in Germany alone , VW calls about 2.5 million cars to upgrade to the workshops .
in the course of dis@@ arm@@ ament , VW affir@@ med that the conversion of cars had no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles it does not include fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor capacity no wor@@ sen@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bus station will be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the upgrade , but don &apos;t speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was on Friday in the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason of legal in@@ tru@@ ths .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen advanced its German customers now a guarantee of equipped diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed the last Monday VW @-@ Repres@@ ent@@ atives in the Federal Foreign Office .
it was confirmed by the Ministry of Transport that there was a meeting .
&quot; VW had to fulfil the editions of my inquiry committee and the KBA user . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from this will not be accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW did not have the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor capacity after re@@ arm@@ ament does not require deteri@@ or@@ ations and all type of type must remain unchanged .
Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; War@@ ran@@ ty &quot; but not as it did in corporate travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the wide term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen is the possibility that customers might come to a workshop for example half a year after the upgrade , and this will lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in customer interest it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage they have nothing to do with the sc@@ andal caused to safegu@@ ard the possible warranty as it was . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , VW is not using the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands of rich as@@ par@@ agus in future criminal cases - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; head Chef Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers to park the 40 million euros on sight or a day of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German federation of German banks speaks of a single incident and doesn &apos;t notice that no signal : normal as@@ par@@ agus would not fear , to pay for their austerity pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; banks deal with money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay its 0.4 per cent of the pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this charge requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank G@@ mund from September of Private and Company for deposits over 100,000 euros on sight deposit or a day of money .
&quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 costs in the future 400 Euro per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he covered 40 million euros for a period that could be with@@ drawn from one day to the other , and which he could not utilize . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; those lie with me at the central bank account and cause a 0.4 per cent cost , &quot; the bank of the Bank said .
&quot; I can &apos;t lay 4000 Euros for each million . &quot;
the costs give it further after the caus@@ al principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash is easy to leave in the v@@ aults of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen four attacks , I would not have the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Chief Financial Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most clients could have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the co@@ operative association Bayern explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable cost on all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to bear alone , it is not possible to make use economically permanently . &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers .
with penalty for deposits of three million euros , the Thur@@ ing@@ ian folk and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank Al@@ ten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with their sk@@ ate bank in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , CEO of the Bank of Banking , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay attention for in@@ sol@@ es , the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said on the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cli@@ ent@@ ele which is equipped with a little l@@ ush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that can become a problem for a small bank &quot; if they beware of money .
the co@@ operative corporation founded in 1911 in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ fond , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
actors in the region live well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepren@@ eurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the co@@ operative association Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently no further banks known which calculate an offset set for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the German Federal Association of German People &apos;s banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ anks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared end of June : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold to go to Neg@@ ative is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers in Germany will not like that in the width .
Dest@@ ination Pl@@ ates : who bu@@ ys sound plates ?
lon@@ ely , middle age , love plates .
before you come to comment on the p@@ seudonym , in order to sp@@ lit@@ ted it under the p@@ seudonym non @-@ all@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood of men with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the many spoken reproduction of records does not want to welcome a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , which is due to the real@@ ities of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life Nost@@ al@@ gia .
those who have recently purchased a record are all the fore@@ sight according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most prob@@ able buyer group .
it is also no hor@@ des through Hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older turn@@ tables are keeping their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs 53 % ) and enjoying it alone time to spend time ( 69 % vs 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; if this blog would be a news report on television , I would like to follow the camera in a humble street in S@@ oh@@ o , a modest grey suit , before I stand on , holding my hands and something like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
although the Heart of So@@ hos is slowly emp@@ tied to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were based - there are still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record shops .
I would probably ask the camera team to turn the camera for the next part , in which I stand up close to several men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I follow from sister Ray ( data : two young women , three men middle ages ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight men , middle ages , a woman probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , I wonder ?
&quot; I guess it , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these sound plates , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not following him at home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy records , which he could not afford to buy and again buy items that he sold when he was young and ple@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things in which I was probably a little too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agre@@ es to buy the plates , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time and adds : &quot; I smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much .
this is my disaster .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with sister Ray , believes that many customers who hits from You@@ Go@@ v .
he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the medium , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and to get started to buy her old records .
of the talks which I have led , people usually read about 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now , sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
that would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a specific age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Phon@@ ica to detect that record shops offers a cal@@ ming community of pe@@ ers .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers suffered from the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to pull back the stability of familiar sound boards , from objects , the happy young@@ sters .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a empt@@ iness or possession of materi@@ ally poss@@ essions than a kind of comfort , &quot; TH@@ Z says .
that is my collector for me , and I think it is so many people .
it is a simple way to explore spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; fl@@ utes a staff from a record stack .
a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April that almost 50 % of people bought a record last month they haven &apos;t heard .
the survey also found out that 41 % have a turn@@ table that they never use while 7 % of those who buy one plate , do not have turn@@ tables .
at this time of the message , I would probably look very worried as I leaf@@ ed through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( number of people : three men middle age ) has noticed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dry aspect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; somebody came only recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a Radio@@ head Record board so I can put them on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product heavy , less musi@@ c@@ astic .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ table . &quot;
these are younger people , not older who can only come slowly .
F@@ opp , which has the sound plates for almost a whole floor , has an enter@@ taining audience than I go .
there are couples about 70 , tourists , pictures make , teenagers and women middle ages .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops , Wild Be@@ asts latest syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ ch@@ eted pop instead of experimental Jazz has grown from the loud@@ speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity of customers .
none of them looks strange but nag@@ ging psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are hard to determine if one stands next to someone over 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around in the shop for several minutes and sees the variety of plates that are sold for sale .
it is rather a display man@@ nequ@@ in than a bulk purchase .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so the collecting of records is not a real option , says it .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in other way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a si@@ gh si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a shop , of which it is said that a new generation of sub@@ lime players should have inspired : urban Out@@ jams .
while I ad@@ mit to mu@@ ff@@ ing the je@@ ans hot@@ line , I watch a group of young teenagers that will group for a moment around Polar@@ oid cameras , before a father and his daughter will think to buy a Cro@@ ats turn@@ table .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential records for an average collection .
nobody can look at her - maybe because they are purely decorative , some as far as it is impossible to touch it .
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
but considering the fact that any attraction for these items will mean more money for the industry and could send a few customers to the Deep So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain .
there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is the one that gives most for luxury objects like plates .
even when my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v do , let them say , at least in record shops in S@@ oh@@ o , the great number of female collectors and turn@@ tables exist , which exist in reality , record shops and online .
these people are probably working hard at school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not by st@@ rolling through record shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while starting the star@@ ring view of an in@@ conc@@ e@@ erie , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator , who rises from middle aged over the shoulders .

French court rules on demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
one French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provis@@ ional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live down .
during a court hearing this week the authorities argu@@ ed in Cal@@ ais , that the state should inc@@ iner@@ ate 72 vali@@ ant businesses within the camp of goods that sell cigarettes to energy drinks , selling hair@@ dresser services or to sell tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provis@@ ional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture are argu@@ ed that these places would be torn down because they would be a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and health .
humanitarian groups divided the court that the businesses and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state supported association and other groups not offer enough foods for growing numbers in the camp .
they also led to that the provis@@ ional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for exp@@ ulsion of people who operate the 72 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; provis@@ ional business &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are absolutely comprehen@@ sible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla told that food stores , caf@@ és and restaurants would play a much greater role than to feed people who live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in extreme prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas are quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the re@@ mor@@ sel was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; café of the camp , which is generally operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice to asylum seek@@ ers , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 170@@ .000 people signed the pet@@ ition to keep the Kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian said it was that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children were a catastrophe , of whom the youngest is eight years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated that the number of living in the jungle has increased to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep rise of new@@ com@@ bats in the course of the summer .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to be honest , hard to comment the time of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;

at the time of the World Cup in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title .

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany &apos;s Ras@@ ps have to adjust to the next generation speed monitor : in various federal states , among others in Hessen und Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , the Tem@@ pos@@ urs will be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic effective En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction or to smooth bridge with temporary speed , there are often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary bl@@ itzer for adher@@ ence to speed limit@@ ing .
a permanent mobile construction can however be too dangerous or complex .
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measuring operation , the case data is transmitted over a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously via several tracks .
variable speed limit , as well as transit times after time , transport strip and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the highly experienced state , one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with any car with trailer hit@@ ch .
with that it is not easy to cut , it is lowered in measuring mode so that the wheels in the ar@@ mo@@ red and by the way also van@@ ish the outer hull .
moreover , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer is tested according to Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and has now also been used .
also foreign authorities bl@@ amed with the new technique : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , following an order of 150 pieces last year .
UK re@@ covers silver in 7 @-@ way Ru@@ g@@ by after Fiji Master@@ class Gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening to a sudden stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at De@@ od@@ oro Stadium here in Rio .
Fiji divided a master class in the handling , Side @-@ Step@@ ping , cur@@ press , line winding and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic champion in any color .
the defeat was failed by the not too bad Tro@@ st@@ Award of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on this day - and they could be very proud of their efforts in that tournament in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ final on the same day could fall back in the final .
but ir@@ respective of this , Fiji had produced a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in the form of this form .
it could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not be that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck . Fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben Ryan , the former boss of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult journey behind them .
eight years ago , they lost every game in the Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they just lost one .
this s@@ nap gets hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fiji had very wonderful and left the attacks on the GB@@ s of fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. at , as if one would run in driving buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au moved in the corner .
with four minutes of play , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner , which he converted .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a he@@ ur@@ ra@@ zed T@@ owns of Mitchell stopped the mount of Mann @-@ Nak@@ ar@@ awa to reach a third gate , but it has only stopped Fiji .
in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a reached a touch down at the right corner , and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for the UK .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the resur@@ gence and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ fers through further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion was about 29 @-@ 0 to break .
it &apos;s as if Fiji was born to play the 7 , while GB still da@@ zzle .
it is like that too .
GB guided the basic changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the rati@@ os of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji .
Dan N@@ orton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game had long been fighting for the South Se@@ ers , whose fans sank and dancing on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not hard to admire the playful g@@ j@@ is approach .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i @-@ t@@ ittle with another try in the last seconds .
the wh@@ ist@@ ing sounds that Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB k@@ ick@@ te struck down in the grass .
earlier on the day , Fiji had conquered Japan in a semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a small semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the ground in the first half of the front , but Dan N@@ orton interrupted the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the post in the second half .
a brilli@@ antly late tac@@ kling by Marcus Watson , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ AS@@ IDE team secured the gain - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the cancer of the trainer to win the ru@@ d@@ der victory
there will be no engine in colour than those games , giving that which you want .
from the first beat down to the last , 220 hard h@@ ie@@ ves that go down into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who sat in the boat , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the train@@ ers Robin Williams was there , as she ru@@ ined the second Olympic champion of two without a tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of the British sport that put such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , her 3@@ 9.@@ ter under@@ going operation , which is un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant athl@@ ete that gli@@ des over the surface with the elegance of s@@ warf , which is not reflected by the nature of the Tri@@ umph@@ al Arch .
behind each gold in the rowing is a batt@@ al@@ ion of willing hel@@ pers to make up the difference , and no one was more hil@@ ari@@ ous than the trainer , which would not survive this day at all , when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do this , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been quite a bad situation .
it changes a little bit of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio were lucky that he could start treatment in early 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if this is at all the right term .
I needed money , so it soon had to go better .
it was an inc@@ en@@ tive .
I was in the hospital and ran at the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient .
that &apos;s how it starts .
rowing itself is a challenge , but it makes it a bigger one .
in the in@@ medi@@ ate of victory , their first thoughts passed to Williams , who had just spent a little bit more than anyone else , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning who was as captain in the Royal Art@@ illery regim@@ ent in an employment in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . that &apos;s perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Helen and Robin worked with Robin .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thanks to him is the best trainer in the world .
I would not have a better person to practise or want a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a tough rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had much in reserve .
we were very caught very at the moment .
Helen cried , &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it &apos;s really important to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t out of making something great .
we wanted no fireworks today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , what we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week at a wedding , your own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that would have too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympic champion .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
feeling so much better , &quot; she said .
exemplary for clarity for 31 years
the director of the general association &quot; V@@ eit@@ ure Group , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring .
the association is considered &quot; Bavarian &quot; exemplary . &quot;
a small F@@ rän@@ k@@ ischer drinking water functional group as a model for the great water producers .
this was the same before some time ago at the original in a post of Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
a little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia announced the purpose of the Pur@@ ge .
the work of the v@@ eit@@ ure group applied to Bavarian as exemplary . &quot;
after all this is Rupert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the practic@@ ality , has 28 years as managing director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water functional group with its seat in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes about 15@@ 0,000 cubic meters of water every year and provides 32 places and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member municip@@ alities are church loud , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of B@@ aun@@ ach .
there are water suppliers for further cities and municip@@ alities .
the current Chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns mayor in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Rupert G@@ öller was appointed as a water@@ keeper in 1985 and was appointed as the Director of the Pur@@ pose Union in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks are very diverse and they extend from water management and maintenance activities , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency par@@ agra@@ phs on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as outstanding events she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new foun@@ tains ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new bore@@ holes ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the renovation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , and the re@@ generation of water pipes .
there have been no stand@@ still , and always new additions , because water is de@@ bit@@ ed and drinking water is the most important foods .
in their eu@@ log@@ y , they praised G@@ öl@@ lers , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has used himself with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose band and he lived with the water @-@ purpose band as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago he served as a real pract@@ iti@@ oner of the success concept of the v@@ eit@@ ure group for nit@@ rate prior to the Water Forum of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia .
I received a lot of recognition and praise .
Rupert G@@ öller is one of the Germans , Alf@@ ons Grie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water man and he was a faithful Kn@@ appe .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from his point of view he described the Brun@@ n@@ plant and the restructuring of the purpose .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult employment , however , was the pipe demol@@ ition at Kirch@@ ier on a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees the whole night , so that the villages with water could be looked after .
even the supply of brun@@ n has once to be maintained , because you filled the reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succe@@ eds Rupert G@@ öller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ re@@ b@@ ko is open openly with the aut@@ ism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns on to other interested parents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must have the courage to speak about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ te@@ hei@@ de - Hus@@ band sho@@ ots for his partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man has shot up his partner at a house in Bar@@ g@@ te@@ hei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 am and injured them killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man inv@@ oked and indicated us to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the off@@ ender be on the run , after him , I am publicly flag@@ ged .
meanwhile , because Sven S. could be travelling with the car .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 m tall , mus@@ cular , brown , and has a gl@@ itter .
meanwhile , the police has published a photo of him .
but it is a few years old .
in the meantime the man carries a gl@@ itter .
the man should not be addressed right .
he could still bear the weapon , so the police .
who sees Sven S. looks at the age of 110 .
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rators in 1981 .
the police in Lübeck really wanted to do no data to the T@@ ather@@ gang or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims . however , they confirmed that a human being was killed .
&quot; it is a child mal@@ treatment . &quot;
&quot; we do not say more at the moment , &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lübeck .
a special police command ( SEK ) was paid at the crime scene .
steel - light position for German steel industry
the driven and energy intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millimeters .
financial loads that thre@@ aten the sector from the oil production line are from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there remain the exemp@@ tion of the renewable energy investment in stock for the so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister of Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West German General Newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fre@@ it@@ ag@@ edition ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really happy that we finally able to reach that after two years of negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission was therefore planned to implement the steel producer , the gases coming from the high stove to power generation for their own consumption , to checkout .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros a year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , I now give up a certificate of cleaning with the EU Commission following talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators can be replaced in the steel works , it has an EEG real@@ location of 20 percent .
but these are not raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission on its own power .
with this the status Quo &apos;s status Quo will largely be established .
special meaning I have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is , this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even during the reform of emission @-@ requirements , climate and employment goals must be wat@@ ered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suff@@ ers from excess capacities and a considerable price pressure since the financial crisis of 2008 .
last year , the situation further intensi@@ fied , as the world &apos;s largest producer has rolled steel to the global market in view of the weak local demand .
European producers t@@ oss Chinese steel concerts price d@@ umping .
in the course of this spring , the situation has slightly relaxed .
firstly , import duties on import steel effect to others have he@@ eded the economic prospects in China .
how sustainable is the price repet@@ ition is un@@ clear .
the German industry Pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp remained c@@ auti@@ ous on Thursday .
last , the prices would have been stag@@ n@@ ated again .
the sector re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp also wanted to not exclu@@ de some se@@ clu@@ sions of individual works .
around 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry by the end of 2015 .
in July , German steel manufacturers are c@@ auti@@ ous despite increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced 3.4 million tonnes a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the economic association took place on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the manufactured amount returned to the second month in a row .
production is by two percent since the beginning of the year .
the association is reck@@ oned in the coming months thanks to an improved volume of order .

by the way , they do something good in their health and mind .
for singing is equal from several perspectives , a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior citizen .
most sen@@ iors sing in the chor@@ us and share with pe@@ ers the joy of music descri@@ bing H@@ ac@@ kler .
regular combinations can take part and maintain social contacts .
because often social and familiar structures are frequent at the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel K@@ ip@@ p in her choir , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To arrange and organize himself on the others - a choir is a very special form of being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be stren@@ uous in the positive sense , means H@@ ac@@ kler .
for you train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who demands his lungs regularly doesn &apos;t come out of the pu@@ rest in everyday life either .
even if it comes to get the sound of the voice in the age , singing is an optimal hobby .
in elderly people , singing often has a special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of Sen@@ iors @-@ Organ@@ iz@@ ers .
in the older generations , common singing had a much higher job , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , it explains .
L@@ enz frequently observed that the singing or hearing of songs by elderly people w@@ akes many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
with lyrics and especially melodies , the disease of the disease itself ent@@ an@@ gled to long past events .
in singing , the head also requires a special power , explains L@@ enz .
simultaneously , on the own voice and to focus on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a major cogn@@ itive challenge .
just older people living alone that are living alone , not just concentr@@ ating on yourself .
another positive aspect is the recognition , which one drives through singing in the chor@@ us , means H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a fantastic praise .
the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em is also growing by singing in the choir .
to show itself : if I take a lot for something , I will better and watch over myself - this experience strength@@ ens .
good reasons to start singing with singing , so there is enough .
who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent , he says L@@ enz .
you do not sing alone - at 50 sin@@ ful people who hears , when a tone goes beside it ?
looking for the right offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if a man sings from the awareness of an old child , one can simply join them .
many cities also offer views of choirs in the area .
who wants to sing in a church choir , can directly turn to the church or church leaders .
there are many people &apos;s choirs to be found via the Internet .
if you don &apos;t have access to the Internet , your family , friends or neigh@@ bors will ask for help with the internet search .
those who desire to sing , should join with a choir , av@@ eng@@ ed h@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that &apos;s true for every age .
cats respond sensitive as cr@@ ater on cri@@ es of the young animals
biolog@@ ists have studied in Hanover what effect the call of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ru@@ ys has grown on adult animals .
for their surprise , the males did not let the males too cold - however they kept in the difference to the females always the same .
female cats may recognize the ar@@ ra@@ vel of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ru@@ ys on the st@@ ow of the little ones .
they respond more than ten percent faster to those of kit@@ ten , who have found out in big trouble as scientists have found out of the veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
c@@ ater also react to the k@@ ittens of kit@@ ties - though always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mus@@ sels of less and strongly ruled spring for the males either unable either perc@@ ep@@ tible , or not of importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wie@@ b@@ ke Con@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the trade magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in previous investigation the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ ittens @-@ Schre@@ ie distingu@@ ishes with the ur@@ gency of their help .
a total of nine adult cats and eight males were observed in the MH@@ H &apos;s animal hus@@ band@@ age .
they were played for a break of small ones who were taken from the Wur@@ f@@ box for three minutes and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other , they were confron@@ ted with scre@@ ams of stronger bi@@ b who were raised in addition .
the researchers have their results in spite of the small sample of meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those who still had no own offspring , responded to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to loudspeaker , when this ru@@ ff played the very reg@@ ar@@ able k@@ ittens .
this ability may be inv@@ oked or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have responded to all , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in .
in the past scientists have investigated the reactions of women and men on baby sounds .
some studies show that women were highly sensitive to babies , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , the Bi@@ ologist , Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ sky attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; in to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued in Turkey against the erst@@ while football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of the terrorist group .
for the first time after the test attempt , an important football game is taking place in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the Erz@@ ri@@ val between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ und Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul in Istanbul , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even with the approval of the emergency attempt in July , the government refused to be imp@@ aired by the norm , the everyday life of the norm .
this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len movement , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
even before football it is not made .
the public pro@@ secutor issued an arrest warrant against the former star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r .
accordingly , the South America living in America was eliminated to be a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ dek@@ r is to be a sponsor of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ ogan .
although the first condition applied for 90 days of emergency , it was in fact even until October , indeed , the most Turkish living has no effect on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erd@@ ogan on Wednesday for end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into followers and opponent of Erd@@ ogan .
particularly fans of the workers &quot; workers are traditionally not count towards the friends of the President .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what &apos;s the idea of the Turks , in view of dramatic experience in history , is strict re@@ jection of military coup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they even agree with fans - no matter whether your heart beat for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
at Pok@@ al@@ winner &quot; Gala , &quot; they will be back to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky .
in the past season , the Cologne lifted its sporty value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first playing time as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final match against Fen@@ ri@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
the newspaper &quot; fan@@ atics &quot; celebrated him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he has completed the season in excellent way , and his team secured the trophy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disappoin@@ ting season for the record player found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Vor@@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League the &quot; Lion &quot; also der@@ ive from the Europa League early .
in the sw@@ am Li@@ g there was only one to rank six .
the season was not good .
Pok@@ al was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we made it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the game year was better for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 seasonal ten@@ sion@@ ers as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ shel@@ enk@@ nig laid the base for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that fans hope for the return of the 31 year old .
in doing so , he had just returned to the Treaty of Florence and to return to Bes@@ ik@@ tas , after the coup attempt , on account of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club chief F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the Stür@@ mer would have to be willing to ren@@ ounce to roughly one third of his estimated annual budget of € 7.5 million , Or@@ man said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his salary in Florence can &apos;t pay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have medals of chance at Olympia in Rio
34 @-@ year @-@ old Just@@ in Gat@@ lin was closed twice for d@@ oping ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa must not start in Rio .
other super@@ vised athle@@ tics sinners may just laugh about - they are fighting in Rio around medals .
the d@@ oping theme is intended for the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja J@@ eph@@ im@@ owa , who compl@@ ained after a d@@ oping lock in front of the games , was kicked off during their launch ( 100 meters of breast ) .
there was a sk@@ inn@@ y scene : with a set @-@ up smile , she was still in the hall and prov@@ oked with her appearance .
when she noted that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a jub@@ ilee .
but there are numerous other sports@@ men , who go to the start despite D@@ oping past at the Olympic Games in Rio .
here is an overview :
Just@@ in Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in the field of athle@@ tics .
he had been closed for d@@ op@@ ings twice ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
since his spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and Ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m and is regarded as the greatest ch@@ allen@@ ger of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jam@@ Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion in 2010 had to sit down a six month lock when you found the pain of the pain via oxy@@ co@@ don .
she had a strong t@@ ooth@@ ache after a surgery , def@@ ending the 29 @-@ year @-@ old .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the olymp@@ ic player from 2012 , world championships of 2013 and European Championship were positive on the forbidden stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin .
Per@@ kovic denied the economic in@@ gest@@ ion and was closed for six months .
the four most widespread lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big gol@@ f@@ itter .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics Champion and two @-@ time world champion more than 400 m , had been tested positively and locked for 21 months in 2010 .
a remedy to penis enlargement has been responsible , with@@ ered Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has over 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest man .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ smith , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athletes have been detected as many medals .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after it was established testosterone @-@ d@@ oping .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ d@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he also recognized the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a decision by the International Court of Justice at CAS .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked two of the World Ranking List .
Liu Hong Kong ( 20 km of walking , China ) : the world record of world champion and gold favorite was only tested in May , but may still start in Rio .
when the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world championships were found evidence of taking a forbidden supplement of dietary supplements , the lock of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency WA@@ DA was mild and ran off on July 13 .
bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand , with the woman in contact , said the speaker of the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fre@@ it@@ ag@@ early .
they had suffered be@@ tw@@ ins and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it .
they planned a home journey for early September .
whether from further explo@@ sions on holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ al are also affected by Austrian citizens , is still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities such as car@@ c@@ ting .
just about 200 kilometres south of the Hu@@ a H@@ in capital , Hu@@ a H@@ in was first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a picnic .
according to police , a ph@@ il@@ itary forces were killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Fre@@ it@@ ag@@ hes rose up again two spr@@ inkl@@ es , and a further man was killed according to the authorities .
there was also a bomb explosion in the morning .
during the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular Ba@@ dist@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police authorities .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country there explo@@ ded another bomb that killed an urban attraction .
according to the authorities in a flower bed , the bomb explo@@ ded in front of the re@@ vier of the coastal police .
finally det@@ on@@ ations held in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g at the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the Southeast Coast saw several injured .
one go from a link with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , named it .
&quot; the bomb ent@@ atives carry the same manuscript , &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai Crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fre@@ it@@ ag@@ early before journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too early to express yourself about different motives - but it is probably the actions taken by Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted a pattern to recognize a pattern that is typical of the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police declared that the attacks would not follow in connection with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ gency movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to restricted areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you rather expect from that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities have obtained sec@@ rec@@ y references in the south of the country in recent days - but they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact timing and places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
still un@@ clear what group behind the attacks .
the police showed its officials all over the country to increase security around important government buildings , as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ usement parks .
in Thailand , there are still smaller bomb attacks , but they do not depend on tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in there is a palace that was used over the years by King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the reason of reason , the Austrian Foreign Office recommends the Austrian Foreign Ministry on his homepage to make the instructions of Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ be and Sur@@ ro@@ undings .
to disputes between security forces and Muslim popul@@ ations , not necessary travel in these provinces are not necessary .
increased safety risk ( level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were carried out a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution .
this dre@@ amt of military influence even in the coming years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jun@@ ta boss and prime minister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ cha &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bombs would have been an attempt to put chaos , while the country in the direction of stability , improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the military un@@ ta , which had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody up@@ heav@@ al , adher@@ es to itself to have led the kingdom over stability and order .
however , the military has not managed to get a grip on the Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost one year ago in Bangkok was killed by an attack on a popular Hindu shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the most bloody stop in the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is the visor of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
after several tribes , the const@@ itu@@ tion@@ aries in the Con@@ federation also demonstrated the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for aspir@@ ations against the Freedom of democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ es , the German Press Agency , said in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so immig@@ rant of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist manner .
this is why we are watching the movement now .
the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multic@@ ul@@ tur@@ i @-@ guards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of their own identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitutional protection in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Wu@@ er@@ ttemberg , NRW , Nieders@@ achsen , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - watch the &quot; identical &quot; already .
Ma@@ es said that his authority were closely coordinated with the offices of the country .
&quot; groups like the &apos; Ident@@ ity Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group up , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Chief .
generally try to speak extrem@@ ists with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the Islam@@ ists equally as right trem@@ ors .
this is not commercial advertisement for your own thing .
propaganda is to respond emotion@@ ally to people .
young people are in a special way sus@@ cep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
last from several federal states reports on contacts of &quot; identity &quot; at AF@@ D @-@ politicians .
Ma@@ es said , I have no knowledge .
the possible contacts of this species are relevant only from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective Party - in this case the AF@@ D - by certain persons , the extrem@@ ist , is to change their target direction and is extremely extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is , whether such people have to control the party .
this is not recognis@@ able .
with views on the clear increase of legal crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee camps , Ma@@ did , he would not speak of new terrorism in this context .
but we have seen in recent years that it can give legal ror@@ ist structures .
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fre@@ sh@@ er Group .
it may well be that further legal blo@@ oming group@@ ings or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee bugs or attacks from other right @-@ wing mist@@ ic motives .
a German or Europe @-@ wide controller of rec@@ er@@ ror@@ ism be not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
concerned , Ma@@ did concerned about having many attacks on the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before .
this is wor@@ r@@ ying .
many of the susp@@ ect at attacks on asylum bases have previously not been known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated off@@ ender or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed off@@ ences that had nothing to do with right @-@ experts , who were perhaps elected politically in@@ different or voted for the CDU , SPD or left wing themselves to radic@@ ally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radic@@ ally &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympic Games or world records head@@ lines in the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous performance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros having the summer playing in Rio de Janeiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia is so slow that it was no longer visible in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected .
in the social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently transferred to the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old completed its predecessor and took the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporting figure , which attracted the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old took part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian was a special start by the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in the unknown countries of well known countries .
as in equ@@ ities , most sports@@ men were running , Hab@@ te wanted to make something different .
preparation is everything : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names made the lap fast .
some media described him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of W@@ al . &quot;
the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made it funny in accordance to a &quot; welfare state &quot; of him .
his time , he only beat with one minute and almost five seconds ahead of the 100 meters of Freist@@ il , played no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete with 100 meters of Freist@@ il alone .
f@@ rene@@ tically was fired in Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i back then .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old had only eight months before Olympic swimming and had never had a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump sees the dro@@ pping const@@ itu@@ ent not so narrow
the rep@@ ubli@@ can candidate Donald Tr@@ ump refers to a campaign event in Florida .
by choosing the US President , Donald Tr@@ ump has already performed an alternative video .
he then drove into the holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump loses the U.S. Presi@@ dential elections in November , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately it would be open , or I have a very nice , long vacation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the US television sen@@ ders CN@@ BC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it was for him in the end for the reasons for political correc@@ t@@ ness , that is ok , said Tr@@ ump .
thus he called US President Barack Obama and the candidate in demo@@ c@@ rats , Hillary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist state ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more resistance formed .

the consumer research company Gf@@ K is exchange his head with Matthias Hartmann .
the set@@ backs came suddenly - but not surprisingly .
the tough position of the market research company Gf@@ K said it was the chair of Matthias Hartmann , which will remain un@@ certain , the longer the achievements under@@ gone by him .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who will continue to le@@ ver market research in future is still un@@ clear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in An@@ chor@@ us it was named on Friday , at the shareholders &quot; last dis@@ appointment over the continuing success of years ago initiated restructuring .
Mr. Hartmann is on the Gf@@ K @-@ top since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the re@@ structure of restructuring has not yet been seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the latest bad Gf@@ K business , each share of shares will eventually be un@@ ste@@ ady .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that would be the case in BMW , the Qu@@ and@@ ts would also do the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
following proposals in the preceding quarter , the Company also did not stop its los@@ s@@ way in the second quarter of 2016 .
with a total of 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales fell by 6.1 percent lower than the previous year &apos;s level .
sales of 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million euros fell in relation to the first half of the year by 3.4 percent .
the earnings in the second quarter were mainly bur@@ dened by the firm value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation .
the Group &apos;s business value , which was determined by the Consumer Experience , contributed EUR 139 million to the Group under the line of a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K won a net income of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus sli@@ t in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ end@@ n in Gra@@ ben : eight injured
an accident involving 43 sen@@ iors and passengers were injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ end@@ n ( county Aur@@ i ) on Thursday .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injury , divided the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to an opposite side of the bus , had to escape to the opposite side road .
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as spokesperson on the police Aur@@ i / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; because of the bus location the bus could not leave the bus self @-@ independent , &quot; she said .
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the in@@ mates .
six ambul@@ ances and ambul@@ ances came to the accident site on the state road 2 .
the last trav@@ eler were brought back by a regular service bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ list@@ ner quarter of Pe@@ ws@@ um .
there they should wait for a substitute bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the carrier and possible witness to report to the police .
the fees per cubic metres of waste water amount from 1 October 2016 for the area of w@@ ast@@ e@@ water plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / World cup 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 Euro ; for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously : 2.@@ 26 euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously : 2.@@ 18 euro ) .
in the installation in Az@@ endorf , the w@@ ast@@ e@@ age fee will increase if necessary improvements are needed .
after a excessive amount of calculation the se@@ wage costs in Az@@ endorf will then lie at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
such as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) , was noted for the approval of the budget by the estate and Kul@@ mb@@ ach , to work out for these w@@ ast@@ e@@ water systems .
according to the legal foundation , the Kas@@ endorf is obliged to provide heating systems with cost @-@ covering plants .
as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens and commercial and industrial companies from which were called &quot; Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ tenberg ranks deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt indicated the body , it was necessary to re@@ charge the charges for se@@ wer@@ age of the market .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous cal@@ kul@@ ation period must be paid .
the excav@@ ated increases increases Schmidt thus , that it is in all three se@@ wage plants for relatively small facilities with a very low se@@ wage in@@ case , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenditure for the repairs carried out by several thousand euros would be engraved .
san@@ itation in all three plants is slightly lower .
furthermore , in the back period of calculations in all three plants last year , not least due to their age of reconstruction and repair expenses .
the complex in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for which the pole , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt proved that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf , the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged due to an accident .
in the pum@@ ped pole , the nearly 20 years old conveyor belts had to be over@@ hau@@ led and after almost 20 years of operation the first nur@@ sing pond had to be installed , the se@@ wage slu@@ dge had to be installed and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to keep water@@ proof@@ ing requirements in future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued coun@@ tenance and maintenance costs came to be considered correspon@@ d@@ ingly in the new Kal@@ kul@@ ation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which are significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stein@@ häuser made clear that the expenditure for the operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filled with small w@@ ast@@ age in the three plants &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
additionally , Schmidt completed the market community of great maintenance costs in se@@ wage plants in the past 20 years .
the situation for the mentioned units will remain prec@@ ed@@ ent according to the view of stone houses on a permanent basis , since the supply zone of the san@@ itation association Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al could not be enlarged because it is about deficit facilities .

snapshots &quot; An@@ ime &quot; Eff@@ ect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critic@@ ized
Snap@@ chat states that this filter is an anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is un@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool , it enables Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with ident@@ ities in such a way that borders the sur@@ sur@@ de .
you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be seen from a Roy Lich@@ ten@@ stein paintings .
the filters are amazing , independent tools , which generate more than 30 million enhanced Sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ tr@@ itte will arrive to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have moved in the past critic@@ isms that they were accused of using the app Black@@ face för@@ dere or white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when this week a filter proposed a filter that gave them sle@@ wing , false teeth and dar@@ ker che@@ eks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some critics have seen a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow face &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they in@@ quired of whether these repeated controversi@@ es indicates a larger problem , that the company has diversity .
the news and the con@@ spi@@ racy were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat provided that it would dis@@ ables the feature .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was given a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us recall that the filter in@@ viol@@ ated c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et was widely distributed over the photos that the filter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; viol@@ ate and m@@ ild@@ ly was in@@ comfortable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the contrast of a very conflic@@ ted Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the fil@@ tering effects .
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ able , but it has been drawn at the sli@@ pping extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses these cultural stum@@ bled eggs .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integr@@ ating battle , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the equipment we all hold in the hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats vast audience of young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed in race than their older counter@@ part - might rather expect sen@@ sibility to expect sen@@ sibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if one of the Snap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters a picture is created , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much harder for a user to be noticed when it was earlier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account , others asked to do the same .
in an essay by medium and in a phone interview she said she believes that ra@@ cking @-@ related controversi@@ es reflects a lack of diversity in the con@@ stell@@ ation practices in Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ized the large part white , only male leadership , finishing her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either I have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that are working there , but not in positions in which they may feel safe or good in order to say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that is mostly ignored the Snap@@ chat .
the company does not publish facts about the diversity of its staff and points to his status as a private company .
on Thursday , it refused to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his employees , but according to an spokes@@ man , the company recently focused a personnel responsible which focuses on the represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu said that she will be closed her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users as we need to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military command @-@ def@@ ensive ISIS secret services , representing the Congress
military personnel in the United States Central Command changed re@@ ordin@@ ate information to record an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , having allowed the actual conditions on the site in a report on Thursday .
the provis@@ ional report , created by a Task Force of the rep@@ ubli@@ can members of the dispute , secret service agents and the Wehrmacht bud@@ get@@ ary , reported how su@@ peri@@ ors changed their ass@@ ess@@ ments to the American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State .
central Command , short cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; news articles that were typically charged by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander in a positive picture by the American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on site were allowed and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what has been done at Cent@@ Com , is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers are suffering if poor analysis of our political leaders , &quot; presented Ken Cal@@ vert , rep@@ ubli@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
the leadership errors in Cent@@ Com turn to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows great problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence to change the government peaks under Obama , the report shows how anal@@ ysts looked at the pressure from their privileges , also known as an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements in front of the Congress were clearly positive than it corresponds to the facts . &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com family disclos@@ ed publicly that a military recovery of Mos@@ sul@@ s could start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , it is so much clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , rep@@ ubli@@ can congress of Kansas , in a statement .
central command that changes the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of the year 2015 changed the right @-@ ordin@@ ate reports to down the danger through ISIS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to life after them was told that anal@@ ysts were concerned about manip@@ ulating reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings , while the investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the general spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defense .
Democratic members of the News Con@@ scienti@@ ous tees published their own findings on Thursday , which co@@ inci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the rep@@ ubli@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com ruled an over@@ ly restricted process for creation of re@@ ass@@ ess@@ ments regarding IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the highest @-@ level Democ@@ rat of Adam B. Schiff , a member of the Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Adam B. Schiff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this process , &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed publication of Con@@ scienti@@ ous reports , &quot; preaching the mor@@ ale under anal@@ ysts and &quot; gave very little space for different opinions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Democrats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said to have found no indications for entering the White House at Cent@@ Com Anal@@ ysts regarding a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political mind &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
in August , the New York Times had reported investigations by the Pentagon Chief of inspec@@ tor , which were enrolled by Cent@@ Com Anal@@ ysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press spokes@@ man of the Pentagon , announced that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress , while the investigations of the general inspec@@ te@@ urs were still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are sometimes quite di@@ verg@@ ent opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investigations have put on the question of a successful air struggle under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the alle@@ g@@ ations of the past year have raised the question , to which President Obama can rely on Central Command for the honest operations of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the Islamic State remind of the Islamic State of more than ten years ago , when Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a lot of evidence against the recommendations of many anal@@ ysts in Iraq , and had little time on it to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that contrary to government officials should not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since this provis@@ ional refin@@ eries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ res dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ized by members of the legisl@@ ative because of its excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the U.S. win four @-@ fourth match in the field of hockey women , a show@@ down with Britain .
one day after they shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match against India that Americans won at 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their goals in mind .
however , this is obvious : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are con@@ tested in their group with the Brit@@ ons at first place , which remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will succ@@ um@@ bed on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which both teams will gain the first and second place within their group .
the first placed will see the strong Hol@@ der@@ land a little longer out of the way that the other group leads .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , Americans have triggered a surprising host by their success story , four years after they ended up in the last London Games on the last 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania on , and had the first time with three years a hockey team in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years it became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
it missed the Olympics in 2008 , since they could not qualify for the com@@ b@@ ader .
then came the year 2012 , where she went for her and her team .
in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of national teams and thus began to get things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical ex@@ changes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the job creation in London , which we now have .
we can carry out the ru@@ d@@ der completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the goal in the first half of the game with a return from the Middle East .
India was gone without victory in the tournament , but the team showed a surprisingly tough and held the pitch of 1 @-@ 0 up to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
it carried a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and crossed the ball to get the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 leadership .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last fourth .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jackie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to rent a gate in any of the previous games .
it has a course .
same as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will hin@@ ge on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of Tramp@@ ol@@ ins
wherever you are , as late as it is , the Olympic Games are .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constantly and inevitable , a fast relay between competition and stri@@ ves .
it is as if the olymp@@ ic f@@ ack@@ el himself would be a burning staff that is to protect the swimming pool to the race to the tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the talking of your neighbours in the waiting period without Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cht@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le Clos .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a female wh@@ ist@@ age with dimples , could not be allowed to be sent to the Prime Time to be sent to the Prime Time , being a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even Fe@@ eder .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the Olympic trampoline for gold .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the center , partly in the shadow , are the sports that are not univers@@ ally recognized : air pist@@ ols , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ minton , ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the chest swimming and may reign for a long time .
but if I should make a modest arguments for my particular favourite , let me get attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline .
although the jumping on the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had made its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years has been so sc@@ ary that many were asked , did not know that it is at all an Olympic port@@ .
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
although the USA has sent a competition at the competition , it has never again won a medal in the jumping on the trampoline until 2012 , who made it until the end of the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share their prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian to share the men .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend her gold medal from London this year .
the jumping on the trampoline has a certain exterior char@@ me , partly because it sounds for the un@@ solved ear for a C@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule as the for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should ad@@ mit that I am not an expert but only an bound enthusi@@ ast .
it has a hum@@ oral potential - the cart@@ o@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never s@@ wollen asc@@ end - but also the Gra@@ zie of the Turn@@ around and diving , the two sports that essentially combines .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means a lot like &quot; spring@@ board . &quot;
the upcoming winners jump on a giant trampoline , shoot nearly up to 30 foot in the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( thre@@ aten , h@@ ens and sage ) before they end up on the feet .
they will be judged according to the official Olympic Champion after the finish , difficulty and &apos; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are competing in Rio .
the most common Olympic vector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts are hoping to go forward in their quest for gold , faster , upward and above , sometimes up to the destination , sometimes up and back , down and down on the playground .
they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but in the TV broadcast another category : die the world or the Olympics .
the sc@@ rub@@ bing str@@ uts is no@@ bel , admi@@ ra@@ ble , even fan@@ atical - and there is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I feel when trying these games as something f@@ ati@@ gu@@ ing .
the trampoline offers a breathing break .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the target .
he or she jum@@ ped off , seem@@ ingly heavy as a ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then back again .
there is also a contest , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no v@@ aults to the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant up@@ lift of time and gravity .
it &apos;s so Zen like the competition for the Olympic Games .
the qualifying and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming of 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men &apos;s on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
NBC will run the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days starting at 14.00 .
at the heart of Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a calm , nice moment , a very good thing that is likely to over@@ look in general tum@@ ult .
if the increase of consciousness can be reached only through the att@@ aining and objec@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes , according to the The Wall Street Journal pre @-@ beat - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his new fan@@ base .
&quot; a generation protest@@ ing &quot; in Ethiopia , Long , a group of U.@@ S .
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia are strug@@ gling with the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses test@@ ify that zig protests were killed during clas@@ hes with the police in fire@@ arms .
is Ethiopia ready to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded in more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was merciful to human rights organizations .
witnesses test@@ ified that polic@@ emen were sh@@ aking up un@@ armed and killed .
in circulation videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security personnel were forced to strike young people with sticks , while these were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN agency for human rights now demands an incoming investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold that country and in future it will even be more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a Research Group .
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and is appreciated by the West in Nigeria .
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror across the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if any , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded in considerable temp@@ o .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pend@@ ulum in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia had anything other than a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continuously expanded their re@@ pression by the government - the opposition in the country was constra@@ ined ; the dis@@ si@@ dents were effective for silence .
many were sent into exile or in jail , or put into the W@@ ages of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth is protest@@ ing .
a generation is protest@@ ing .
there are numerous complaints which cover everything from the ground use until the stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to power of ruling coalition .
after a significant critical election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , ten@@ sions rise along the border of Er@@ it@@ rea ; a fight for these c@@ un@@ chy , controversial line called for hundreds of life .
they fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which were more or less forced by the tur@@ mo@@ il , to profit the tur@@ mo@@ il and to arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ ing after years of an@@ kles will now explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians had been able to communicate through the social media as a smart phones were becoming more and more frequent and improved their Internet services .
even if the government blocked access to Facebook and Twitter what they are in regular intervals , especially at protests , many people still can communicate more about Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide and where they can stop .
several young Ethiop@@ ians encounter@@ ed that they were gathered together to protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two biggest forces in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not as natural enemies .
since e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who mainly come from Ae@@ ge@@ op@@ ia to the majority of Christian , in politics and the economy , as they explo@@ ited the Oro@@ sei , many Muslims are and live in flat@@ land areas .
but this also changes .
&quot; we are there to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the largest protests were held in the regions of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and that are dominant in the military , in the secret services , in trade and politics .
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader until his death in a non @-@ public disease in 2012 , Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was regarded as tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think about corners .
anal@@ ysts say that it was especially engaged to perceive early indications of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special arran@@ ges to process opponents and make them dam@@ aging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the present regime , it l@@ acks a conflict of conflict , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
when Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
anal@@ ysts say that he is not enjoying the confidence that controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia had experienced such an up@@ heav@@ al in 2005 , after thousands of elections were protest@@ ing according to the information of analy@@ tics by the government and were subsequently stolen .
while the following Raz@@ ors were killed many protest@@ ers , even if it was less than in the past few months , and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for visionary infra@@ structures , such as the new pend@@ ulum campaign , as well as for their meas@@ ur@@ able adv@@ ances in poverty .
but obviously , this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ chief of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , protest@@ ers in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ical city , run by Tig@@ ray and the hate opposite the Tig@@ ray is still pract@@ ised in social media .
anal@@ ysts say that the US and other Western allies bring allies into a pec@@ uli@@ ar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for d@@ ron@@ gs on the neigh@@ b@@ oured Somalia , even if they recently told that it closed this base .
while the West wants to support democracy clearly , he doesn &apos;t want his ally to breaks into a vol@@ at@@ ile area .
this , &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di said , &quot; is a very thin walk . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama was founded on ISIS &quot; Sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday , that his campaign oppos@@ es that his repeatedly claimed asser@@ tion , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would not have been the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founder &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the terrorist group of Islam@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this clari@@ fication designed new questions on the communication skills of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans whether he is able to communicate it clearly and under@@ stand@@ able with the American public . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also brings his fel@@ lows that make an effort to take him during a event@@ ful phase to declare in the pec@@ uli@@ ar position , which he could not have meant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after gradu@@ al from a campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump received his claim on Thursday saying that he really didn &apos;t intend to interpre@@ t the president and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS .
but in an early morning , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews he said rep@@ ay completely seriously .
when the conservative radio present@@ er Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to de@@ we@@ aken the statement that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republi@@ can candidate wants nothing to know about it .
the last storm critic@@ ises Mr. Tr@@ ump on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while trying to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign due to falling demand to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton kept spe@@ e@@ ches to the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return again to this topic .
he warned against Twitter that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would show proposals to higher taxes and found that he found their spe@@ e@@ ches bored .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought Sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he drew a strong criticism , when he meant , the Russians should be greeted with Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but he explained later , &quot; Of course I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the lingu@@ istic limits in politics and then back on demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans as they arrive , and then , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , an communications expert , who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think he is clever enough to keep his testimony enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of shar@@ pen@@ ing the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has wa@@ xed a bit more than their tone , since its demand values went further .
a new pol@@ l by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a guided tour in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump in general tries to not exc@@ use himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative post@@ ings , he often accused his critics to dis@@ ru@@ de his or her sense of hum@@ our .
but while keeping attention in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump joke has brought his loyal involvement in the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his say@@ ings may be like pro@@ voc@@ ative .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ ump &apos;s most prominent princess talking , there was a great effort to defend the candidates in a CNN interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was question@@ ed if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization that Obama called it background @-@ ben@@ chers , completely wrong and therefore it happened , because he removed the troops from Iraq .
most Main@@ stream rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argue that the government served under Obama , in Mrs. Clinton as a foreign minister , it had allowed ISIS to spread themselves to become aggressive in the Middle East , under control .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media , and designed them to ride on each of his words and to be pre@@ occupied against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , j@@ aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the demo@@ c@@ rats prov@@ oked about Mr. Tr@@ ump exc@@ use when only another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidency .
once over the price pushed from the market , café arrives in green@@ point
ver@@ b Cafe was an embar@@ rass@@ ed café in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices were displac@@ ed from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ Front .
the store of So@@ ap Ch@@ erie used in summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people mour@@ ned for the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , New York is change but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel and ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if New York is change , it is also curiosity .
a re@@ vit@@ ated cafe open last November in green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accept credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing staff of the old caf@@ és , the owner and managing director of the new caf@@ és .
he started working in 2001 at Ver@@ b and stayed there until the end .
when a customer had offered money to al@@ locate funds for a new branch , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained a lot .
ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment with them .
he introduced new ingredients .
there are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bacon and cheese and there are yar@@ ni@@ es such as cap@@ ers and saut@@ é@@ ed onions .
there are natural dishes .
the café serves no beer more , there is fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ guez test@@ ified that he noticed a st@@ ony current of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also displac@@ ed by prizes from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently , in a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly .
even after being drawn to green@@ point she would take the way .
after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave herself for a while , she said .
&quot; I became clear that it was on the coffee and at the culture in the ver@@ b , which pleased me , &quot; she said .
now they drink coffee , even if they made a bl@@ ended ch@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of their usual iced coff@@ ees , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing long@@ time customer since the beginning of the ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went to work there before work and stood still in the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez , he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal always gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said he had no gro@@ ll on it , that the soap business has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owner of So@@ ap Ch@@ erie used to produce a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold bre@@ wed coffee of coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; I think we will go with her offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .
and traditional , Polish citizens Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ guez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told them to soon place her to feel her new neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the site also has additional benefits .
a local juice method wants to fill and sell the cold bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café stands on an adjacent building .
a new ver@@ b is enough for many customers to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and told that he was destroyed by the ground when the café closed .
when the new cafe was opened , Wh@@ itt said it was approaching the Lok@@ as and the bri@@ ghtest a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; an adequate meal &quot;
in March 1933 , following his asc@@ ension to the President Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt , started his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roosevelt was a f@@ ai@@ ble for refined delic@@ ac@@ ies at Fifth Avenue , like P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mar@@ yland water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with people , &quot; said Jane Z@@ iegel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both grocery stores .
co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the United States , while bricks in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; tells about life in a residential home on the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
her newest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a repor@@ ter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sandwich Shop , a small , sn@@ apped I@@ mb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store since the stock market crash of 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese with olive pieces while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed and vegetable mixture .
as the repor@@ ter sau@@ te min@@ ced , this found the couple for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; abundant food was very popular , &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that extends the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat , they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; it must have been in the stomach like lead , &quot; he said .
in the years before the Great Depression the table was found in a American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ Buffet .
teams of women cooked for male field staff and it was served fresh baked p@@ ie for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans that sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shows the ways in which the country went with it , not to be the Cock@@ a@@ ig@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when the Americans was a central , a central theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife didn &apos;t want to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as ten@@ se the new Bud@@ get@@ di@@ ets was : mysterious foods such as bread and c@@ asser@@ ole have become raw food , the c@@ asser@@ ole , as &quot; wonderful way , food resi@@ due , &quot; perceived bricks , because coo@@ ks could hide un@@ ti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry conditions .
for years , the focal point of the American kitchen was , became a rarely served luxury .
pec@@ uli@@ ar mi@@ xes were experim@@ ented , since a low cal@@ orie and nour@@ ishing gr@@ ass@@ ure had prec@@ e@@ dence over taste or even healthy food .
while research for the book , which includes recipes , bricks made a dish from this ep@@ och , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; there was no more popular addition , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Z@@ iegel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions are not fit to suit each other .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeping reserves .
as never before , as ever before , domestic economic agents - among them Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics , between 1923 to 1943 - the eating habits of the country ab@@ rup@@ tly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as they published recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encourage women to become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary critics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the challenge to transform p@@ amp@@ e as creamy sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historical treats .
especially tasty are the reports of the government &apos;s answer to hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ eating .
while he publicly fle@@ dged the simple I@@ owa farmer house kitchen of his kitchen , he stored as the billi@@ on@@ ful man of the world to which he became .
&quot; he liked the continental cuisine like fish with cucum@@ ber sauce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost g@@ ild@@ ed dining room and carried a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was mar@@ vel@@ ous real@@ y alien .
President Roosevelt would perhaps have done the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had urged him to stat@@ u@@ ff with his stomach .
as described in the book , a house@@ man &apos;s house with no interest in flavors caused by Mrs. Roosevelt was that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , to treat with food , was abandoned as soon as the country returned to the legs .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and nour@@ ishment , as well as science was applied to food .
the couple gave better to the writing of the book@@ habits of brick @-@ in law to have understood better - for instance , how they could not throw away food@@ stu@@ ffs .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
Z@@ iegel@@ man remembered : &quot; she really made people sick . &quot;
there was the wind regime .
after the plates of Eis@@ enberg had been evacu@@ ated , they moved and co@@ e drawn a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , that he had lunch for lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Z@@ sealed man and added that it was a usual trick that gave a nice name to a nice trick . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no beat cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
each appeared somewhat re@@ lu@@ ct@@ antly comp@@ elled to a spoon into the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad .
Co@@ E scored three times a night@@ fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a can @-@ do budget he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in Bom@@ b attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar meant his life in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died at an end @-@ bombar@@ d@@ ment of the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group so far , about 6@@ 0,000 people had saved the lives .
29@@ 00 volunteers sit down their own lives to move people from bom@@ bed houses and to afford first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a member of the civil servant that shows him in an 11 hour rescue of a child from the w@@ reck@@ age of a house went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans for the g@@ lowing symbolic character in the gras@@ p of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as heroes , he has never seen himself , said loud : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , that is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die to save lives , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before he fell victim to a victim &apos;s attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have thrown four barrel bombs of the Alz@@ adia district , which was filled with chlor@@ gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from respir@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous remains of the bomb , so that no children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quotes the image his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fatal bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terror@@ ists .
Greenland - the oldest cycl@@ one is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland is usually only coming to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on the ship of the S@@ anna research ship .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and is swimming with a good 1@@ km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland we only get offspring with 150 years .
the Greenland shar@@ k is based on the ground of the North Atlantic coast , an average of 1.@@ 220 meters on average .
only when it reaches , it acceler@@ ates five meters long Tier at a tight 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
this mind@@ set of long @-@ sol@@ itude , however , seems to be a reality concept for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reports in the professional journal &quot; Science &quot; at any time from a Greenland member that could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Alexander Sch@@ wit@@ lein at the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic Research in Rostock this span , which means a world record for ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the evol@@ ution@@ ary head of evolution has long been thought that Greenland will become stone .
only the evidence is lacking .
Grön@@ land@@ shar@@ ks are difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the polar sea ahead of the spar@@ sely populated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface in winter .
researchers have little known about the lifestyle of Greenland .
their time of time pent@@ emp@@ o , in front of S@@ val@@ bard , six animals with a broad@@ c@@ aster .
these shar@@ ks still make the prey : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seals , another one had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear .
maybe they hunt them sleeping animals or pat@@ rou@@ ters the cause of the ice cream and look for cad@@ aver , which leads from higher water layers down .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland shar@@ ks , fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long while the largest 502 @-@ cen@@ tim@@ eters measured .
to determine the age of animals , they analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 method the line core of shar@@ ks .
this centre of the eye relief already occurs before the birth of shar@@ ks , which are contained in it later , are no longer renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the len@@ tic@@ ular .
her birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons tried to carry out greater quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere .
in contrast with 220 cm of its length , the l@@ entil core contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , in its investigation , in 2012 , it should be celebrated its 50th birthday .
in contrast , all major Greenland shar@@ ks had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their len@@ tic@@ ular form , which is created through cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ Clock for an 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timet@@ re @-@ shar@@ k showed an old of 335 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 502 Zen@@ tim@@ eters might be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k @-@ female only got offspring if they are longer than four meters .
now the researchers were able to assign an age to their length .
because one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ tim@@ eters was probably determined at the threshold for sexually mature and its age with 156 years was determined to get Greenland with the multip@@ lication of at least one and a half centuries of time .
this should also be the world record for ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates .
there is no co@@ incidence that such meth@@ ane le@@ es live in icy waters is no co@@ incidence .
the old record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland , caught in his bacon at the neck a 120 year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on top , was caught on Alaska .
due to the low temperatures often the organism of the animals lived on a flame of flame .
they do so later - and al@@ erts slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are also very large .
the volume grows much faster than its surface , due to the animal warmth .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal is therefore dangerous and should concentrate on focusing as many descendants if possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains the evol@@ ution@@ ary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ wit@@ lein as early as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , a very big animal should rather invest his resources in a long life .
building material in double pack
with issues surrounding the building , the council in the youngest session focuses on moder@@ ately .
by relief , the Committee adopted by mayor Robert P@@ utz said that &quot; finally the marketing of recently reported residential areas can begin . &quot;
after the site plans to clari@@ fy , super@@ vis@@ ing and closing arguments , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; road route &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section 1 ) is interested parties , nothing more in the way .
the council is convinced that the blo@@ oms in a rural and tran@@ qui@@ l residential community Schön@@ au young families and in@@ dig@@ n@@ ly sen@@ iors alike .
as it was said , building will@@ s can immediately report in the Town Hall , on the awar@@ ding of the par@@ c@@ els , the council is expected to discuss in its September meeting .
to further requests for the res@@ ett@@ lement of further business enterprises linked to the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the newly created Flemish Action Plan in the spring of this year .
in the field of sub@@ time lar@@ n is expanded by two par@@ c@@ els towards the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
according to the Paris , Dublin , and Luxembourg City , the City presented the best opportunities to create jobs and companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is likely that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the Industrial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ xit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bre@@ xit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is un@@ certain whether financial buildings continue to operate from London &apos;s financial transactions abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU pass this is enough for approval in the UK .
these are just great US banks .
several banks have announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deals with 10,000 new jobs within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , will bring responsibility for monetary policy and super@@ vis@@ ing the biggest banks of the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance view E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk factor ES@@ R@@ B .
although in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but this is less important for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; the proximity to the emergency tank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
in Luxembourg , it &apos;s a large fund to fund , but also cut off in the infrastructure near Dublin as well .
Frankfurt , thanks to the big airport , is clearly easier to reach .
further , the city with slightly available commercial property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it is not that simple to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Seine , the rent for top @-@ class commercial property is 50 percent higher than in the main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life as competition thanks to good medical supplies and infrastructure , as well as less crimin@@ ality .
in a division of business consult@@ ancy Mer@@ cer , the city is at No. seven , Luxembourg to No.@@ 19 and Paris on No.@@ 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if the quality of life is a question of pre@@ ferences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his strong position as a finance location for the domestic market , Frankfurt may be able to attract more banks and investors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London , however , will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite the Bre@@ xit vote .
for this , also the correlation of forces : in London , according to the figures of the Landesbank Hel@@ aba in the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead gets legal access from the hepat@@ itis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs which you have created from the hepat@@ itis C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was released from a claim of damages amounting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , in relation to the block@@ bu@@ ster medicines S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ v@@ oni of Gilead , after a US judge created a pattern of mis@@ conduct by Mer@@ cks , including the Mein@@ ei@@ des and other in@@ eth@@ ic acts .
when the law@@ suit was filed on Thursday , US National judge Sha@@ cht@@ man Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is claim to be the costs incur@@ red during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck is trying to equ@@ ate with Gilead that is governed the market of a new generation of hepat@@ itis C medications that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver illness .
the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took up other def@@ endants and assets to laboratory work , to whom Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vi@@ r acc@@ laimed laboratory work , the active ingredient in the drug of Gilead .
by the US @-@ backed troops say that they have recovered whole control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
the troops supported by the USA have conquered the full control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city have left this , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday .

Clin@@ tons deserve 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
on Friday , Hillary Clinton announced their tax return on Friday , the result for the presidential candidate of Democrats and her husband was a USD 10.@@ 75 million , an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton flew $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former president Bill Clinton generated sales of USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ mption T@@ ons ; the former Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ tons candidate for Vice @-@ President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine , Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax statements of the last ten years .
you paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hillary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to continue with regard to financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clin@@ tons campaign hel@@ per in Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a sharp contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and retreat in regards to his previous promises to publish his tax statements .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements , although they are not obliged by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated a control test as a reason for his ref@@ usal to control the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons voting rights in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , regarding the publication of the presidential candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ ump Special Advisor to CNN says that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release something before tax tests did not complete .
Tr@@ umps critics , among others also the rep@@ ubli@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already stated that his ref@@ usal issues related to assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business units and various other compounds , especially with Russia .
Clinton already over@@ threw a video on the topic and posted a video on the Internet in Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke the topic even during a speech at the business in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other candidate has done in recent decades and rele@@ asing its tax statements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said they too much . &quot; &quot; &quot;
POL@@ IT@@ ICO also reported that Tr@@ ump did not pay any tax in the 1990s for two years , and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a series of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers , indic@@ ating that this could still be the case .
Bundes@@ taxes have become a subject in the election campaign .
Clinton is a scheme who is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that people pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a campaign event for Hillary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ kshire challenged Hath@@ away Industri@@ ek@@ on@@ glomer@@ ate here , Tr@@ ump on a meeting to exchange their tax statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was subjected to a tax examination of the IRS and have failed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the voters and not before the tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign has res@@ ett@@ led the declaration of tax back up to 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0,5 % .
the tax declaration of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that only USD 100 of its income is treated as a reward , unlike most of all Americans .
their main investment fund was an economical In@@ dex@@ fund from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

Jewish director zer@@ a Berlin hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; so@@ lic@@ itation - RT News
a French director with je@@ wish roots unle@@ ashed a media spotlight after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli pre@@ fix as it would have claimed that the Arab guests would have asked for an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Shoah , &quot; carried out his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his recent stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel in the hotel area list .
however , the country was not listed between the countries which can be directly accessed from the hotel room .
what is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
wrote to Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to select Israel over its own call center .
searching for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer he received there , &quot; I shot , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel mentioned that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obvious decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason that stood behind , dissolved in the director even more rage .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre@@ fix is deleted , &quot; was quoted by Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ gel @-@ commercial one called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and over@@ thrown by this event .
this really is very un@@ com@@ promising .
the fact that this in Germany has worn in exactly this hotel chain , is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
we expect the hotel &quot; the right conclusions , &quot; said the ministers .
the incident triggered a rather big reson@@ ance in the internet , where people called the whole sc@@ andal .
some of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel found that it would have been given the alleged gi@@ ve@@ away of Arabic guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was pointed out in another article that the hotel is located on a clas@@ sy spa in the vicinity of a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all acc@@ us@@ ations from himself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ver@@ ge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct directive , &quot; Israel did not record in the quick selection list , &quot; cited the South German newspaper a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds , that the country code was added now .
police sets Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ rant for protest@@ ing Brazilian students
students aboard the Brazilian City of Sao Paulo were gathered together with the police when they were gathered to demonstrate the reform of the government for the public educational system .
the police replaced Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and rubber band against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began , when police officers tried to investig@@ ate the students , which led to the police replaced rubber floor@@ space and lac@@ ri@@ ots .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the govern@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students are being implemented to save money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the protests saw Gra@@ ff@@ it@@ its on the preliminary President Michel T@@ emer on walls .
the most recent protests took place some days after demonstr@@ ators went to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , which was suspended from the Senate by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ in D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the turnover of trade between Moscow and Teh@@ eran , increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the international sanctions imposed on Iran , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in shops in the country , divided the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to provide access to the market .
of course , further commercial building is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he noted that the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 grew by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran , revenues amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade union was reached by deliveries of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan comes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , Russian foreign ministers gave some 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as primarily to travel to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries , which concerns the tourist number in Russia .
it could say that the record numbers Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken , &quot; he said .
at the same time , relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the Ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received monuments of old Persian civilization in a good state , &quot; he said .

Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ my home when Brit@@ on gains gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s call for Sk@@ inner &apos;s last evening in the men &apos;s team in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory as the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow had taken the anchor of his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y made a legend , when he stor@@ med his home to win a victory from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
four years ago England claimed a sho@@ cking win , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick after they took part in March at the railway World Championships in London despite the re@@ sign@@ ation Ho@@ ys just a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the An@@ dri@@ ers Jamie Staff .
they did this in time , when they appeared .
Ho@@ ys reti@@ res a gap that tried to close the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man in which they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that un@@ folds now .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y prevailed - and Sk@@ inner put an Olympic champion in the qualifying rounds , but in the stand@@ out rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders wins in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
behind his lap was almost back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a large proportion of transformation , in which there went down in a higher gear to slow it and it makes passwords and above all Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as BBC expert , Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des fell on the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we set up a olymp@@ ic record in the En@@ dr@@ unde and conquered the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys there was no sign that he fell on the track after a weak start .
he moved that statement back later and there came no appeal of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
there was no such a problem with such a su@@ preme victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have gone so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win over the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation who won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if the barometer of our progress in the last five months is , we expect a successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is possible to match three Olympic gold medals in a competition in the area of possible .
that would be exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23rd ( a seem@@ ingly holy date for the British sport ; on the day , Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - an yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the ho@@ bs of the test@@ is equal .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , which begins today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lon@@ ely , to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he won two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts competition of the day but there were another good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ four kilometer race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 to the destination .
the World Record , who won gold in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will be on safety .
he had fought with advoc@@ ated before the qualification , when he had called him officials to measure his body size .
following the women &apos;s competition , which will continue tomorrow and ended , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Arch@@ i@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie into world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on its strong railway team to domin@@ ate the average period of the Olympic Games and get a sn@@ az@@ aar to medals .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute dom@@ ination in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio went down .
it played play@@ as in the background , so the re@@ sign@@ ation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April amid@@ st sex and bul@@ lying ch@@ okes as well as retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary GB@@ S , who reached its peak in the perfect moment of a perfect moment .
future of melt by Portland due to the repe@@ al of the energy request
the future of the aluminum sch@@ la@@ ze of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers of workers - stand up in the game since the asset owner will withdraw the energy supply contract , as they shared all delivery contracts , as the energy company provided .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to be commissioned by the plant .
a payout for 20 years exp@@ ires in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland are situated on the deck .
not less than 2000 jobs are direct and indirect - due to a closure may be at risk .
in addition , it could come to Domin@@ o@@ eff@@ ect@@ in , since the melt of around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victoria consum@@ es .
in 2014 AL@@ CO@@ A completed the Point Henry melt , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year .
the melt of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland loses money and ris@@ ked a closure .
this step follows the year @-@ long spec@@ ulation in the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar , and lastly on the basis of the power supply for the system .
AG@@ L , who supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Yang A plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , told that three further owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is located in the majority owned by AL@@ CO@@ A and Al@@ um@@ ina , from which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p are holding smaller portions .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Portland is still used , which means a further physical demand for electricity by the melt , &quot; the company shared with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continues to assume that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secured transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will have to enter into force as of November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have signed a 12 @-@ month period of notice , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from hence , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the business year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on income to AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong current markets for wholesale electricity prices .
according to AG@@ L , the value of the stip@@ ulated contracts in the amount of $ 187 million has already stated in the anticip@@ ation of a termination . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to exp@@ ir@@ ate the agreements , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability of Alco@@ hol &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to maintain the melt or the supply of the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not compromise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that there have been a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which should have come into force in 2010 , even if it is still a declaration , why it has been signed by the contract .
analy@@ st war@@ ns due to the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements of anal@@ ysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland will consume about 600 mega@@ watts and Tom@@ ago about 900 mega@@ watts .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; current market &#93; .

ste@@ w Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US V@@ ogue .
ste@@ w , the brand ambassador for E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account on Thursday .
&quot; in a room full of people whom I love , the vision brought me to crying , &quot; I wrote back .
the unve@@ iling of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Family ) , which shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of the most popular Show@@ biz and producer from Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ nant ) , which ends the cover of her sister and that ends with a classic twist : they have all planned a surprise party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ ted action of any birthday episode of a children &apos;s episode ( Se@@ ac@@ nant brought the phr@@ ase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You thought that we had forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Kris had to let her other girl somehow take part at this public@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the September edition of the V@@ ogue started a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans .
Kend@@ ra big sister Kim likes her what the V@@ ogue cover is concerned , struck ( she and her husband C@@ ye West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is for V@@ ogue most likely to be the best edition of the year .
with a gir@@ th that rather resembles a picture band as a fashion magazine , the output puts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the creation 6@@ 15 pages of advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover@@ art is expected to im@@ itate that in the last two years images of the magazine still suff@@ oc@@ ated before the official announcement .
women who were already on cover were Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ r@@ ities , the mos@@ ques &quot; than &quot; models , the celeb@@ r@@ ities are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar @-@ lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even at the low chance that Mrs Jen@@ ner - described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their generation - is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ r@@ ities aren &apos;t related to famous persons or reality Stars or youth from today , who know how to shoot a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if it applies to here@@ after ) .
they are truly talented women who draw themselves in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , published on the last cover , had with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers do not like success each .
with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ant &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat cl@@ amped .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called them &quot; the Mist@@ er of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings cooked up again , when the news came out with the show J@@ enn@@ ers on the V@@ ogue cover .
but to reverse the failure seems to pass at the point .
ste@@ w Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the V@@ ogue .
it is a super@@ model in the sense of the word .
she works for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your under@@ coat of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell you pictures of their respective Pay@@ wall Apps .
they are sold by her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the LOVE .
and in their leisure time they can see in Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal budget quot@@ ations indicate 160@@ .000 people per year
more than 160@@ .000 of the participants in the country are reported annually by the municipal budget , while the industry is attri@@ but@@ able to the impact of further cuts on the already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land three out of five persons - mostly older persons , immigrants , helpful workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ ot@@ ations and those who have no means for un@@ just delay and legal rights .
legal services of the commune , which are already excessive , are prepared for further cuts .
starting in June next year , however , this legal centre will lose further 30 percent of its funding .
the director of the community center of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of National Union of Municipal Council centres revealed that thousands of people were dismissed each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation without raising the government &apos;s decision would only be worse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land municipal utility centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people of important services you need , which you need , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who left violent relationships , people with inde@@ b@@ able and impressive debts , families , who were dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have un@@ solved Problems - all these people have problems legally , and this survey shows that they do not need the help they need .
the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent as of June 2017 , which means that tens of thousands of helpful people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to maintain with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for the Federal Prosecutor and the Bundes@@ just@@ iz@@ ers and sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to withdraw these shorter stays , so that people might need help to receive them in case of legal issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the national government filled its commitment to lift resources on national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now at the time to view the needs of the congregations and their communities , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k is invested in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;

new York : Donald Tr@@ umps Camp@@ a@@ ign has been charged with alleged in@@ action after being told that her campaign manager for North Carolina was aimed at an employee in February while they were travelling in a je@@ ep .
the incident will be described in an indictment which was filed on Wednesday in the District Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bord@@ ini gave up to have been waiting for months that the matter would be regulated internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

after having compl@@ ained with local and regional fighting leadership , Bord@@ ini stated that at least four more persons had the same experience with Phillip , he gave them in the bill of indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to set damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bord@@ ini gave on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the charge applies only two days after the rep@@ ubli@@ can candidate for a crowd in North Carolina said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second Am@@ end@@ ment People &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Bu@@ ffer owners and arms lovers - measures should take action if his ri@@ val Hillary Clinton should appoint and appoint judges . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Berlin / Schwerin : pol@@ l in front of European elections : the SPD and the CDU lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) considerable losses for the SPD and the CDU will emerge .
this resulted in the opinion of opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rain in the north , this is not possible after migration in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in both states the SPD would be the strongest party , and would have good chances to put the government of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD dropped from 3@@ 5.6 percent to 24 percent in five years .
according to the pol@@ l , the party is only just ahead of the CDU , which could return to 23 per cent .
the third place is disputed on the left and the AF@@ D .
the left came to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , AF@@ D would be represented with 19 percent for the first time .
the Gre@@ ens are re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant to increase losses despite a slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 per cent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in Parliament every 3 percent .
only 23 per cent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) according to the German Chamber of Repres@@ ent@@ ative sel@@ ections ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CDU was only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
this means that there are 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left , with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 per cent ) .
AF@@ D would be represented with 14 percent for the first time in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
at 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return to return , the pirates would like to miss a return in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in Contemporary Art : 20 years ago the Nokia Commun@@ ic@@ ator was launched on the market .
the successor domin@@ ate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed nearly half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was thick and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather kno@@ cked .
the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning eight Meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would suff@@ ice for approximately two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the business - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , lovers can buy the devices on the internet , but they come somehow from the st@@ one@@ age of the internet age .
20 years ago the Commun@@ ic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone maker had previously announced the product for a couple of months earlier on the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover as &quot; office in the western world format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for that time a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator to reach .
even the access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers , although slow .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
it was a small antenna , and the phone could be opened like a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
pretty proud was the price : 2700 D Mark , thus roughly 1400 euros .
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could happen in August 1996 that the Commun@@ ic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
everything has been different since then .
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
the mobile phone number of Finn@@ s experienced an un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented disaster , but was eventually sold to Microsoft .
today , vend@@ ors gover@@ n the market that all came much later than Nokia .
be online ever and everywhere , this is a lot of everyday life today .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
around 1.4 billion devices have been sold to Samsung and Apple alone at the age of 5@@ 55 million .
worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
to do this , the well @-@ ongoing business of the countless app vend@@ ors and the t@@ elecommun@@ ications company come .
in the meantime , around the smartphone is created an entire industry .
the decisive breakthrough into the mass market first came in early 2007 , at that time , Apple Chef Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World announced the launch of the iPhone .
he spoke three devices in one : one music player , a telephone and an Internet communications , everything via touch screen easy to use .
the winner of the Apple began , today the iPhone is the most important product in the Group .
Nokia , Motorola , and Black@@ berry , dominated the market .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the days now have Apple and Asian vend@@ ors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a self @-@ comprehen@@ sibility for 20 years after his invention .
on average , each Germans now look at his cell phone 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to put away the smartphone even &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; just Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens executive board for staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the permanent edi@@ bility is now considered a curse and blessing .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will not only work in our local communities and throughout London but in the whole country and prosperity .
for me , it was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as it was in 2012 in London when we used a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and we will get back by creating new opportunities for local and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities alone we will create 10,000 new teachers , 40,000 new jobs , creating youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they prec@@ eded us in London 2012 , there will be such a thing that the challenge of enlargement of He@@ ath@@ rows is too great .
I told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will show ourselves on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question .
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual a infrastructure project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 bn on wit@@ ness@@ ing growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both at the airport and the whole GB . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have chosen a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion and budget investment program , from T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until T2 , which was built among the two frequ@@ ented locations of the world .
now they are ready to supply a third running , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time that we len@@ ose of this Olympic spirit and create He@@ ath@@ row and create a legacy of skills and employment , which can be proud of the England .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding ad block@@ ages
for companies wishing to earn money online , according to one of the software manufacturers , ad blocked , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook recently announced that ad block@@ ings would block on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus released a blo@@ g@@ post in which it told that users can update their filters in the program to block again advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook told us that his desktop page would change the coding concerning its advertis@@ ements , in order to identify the display of advertising , which part of the page advertising is to be more difficult to recognise .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new code .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle has been underway for the invention of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source community &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook quickly comes with a new solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s biggest company for social media has launched in the fight is a strong evidence of how a wor@@ r@@ ying object @-@ lock has become for the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ ge@@ air and Adobe 200 million people worldwide , using a survey of some 200 million people worldwide ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1,@@ 03 billion active users who access Facebook through their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes 84 percent of the advertis@@ ements contributed on Facebook .
the company has no effect on desktop PCs on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on the mobile mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large proportion of the income , so Facebook appears to make the investment of such a stri@@ de as re@@ warding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday Facebook shared his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad award tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to update the people who want to have more control over them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block new filters would be wor@@ r@@ ying , because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to discuss the issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced a spokes@@ man of Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of the people .
woman supposed to over@@ ride suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the free@@ way .
the police are calling witnesses , after a woman in the early hours of the morning on Thursday became an alleged suicide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman came in the dark , &quot; one act of desp@@ air &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss study at the age of 49 , which has been driven by several vehicles , including a load of trucks , wanted to kill himself .
she died on site .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police , these as well as any witness of the incident , said to have been reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was an investig@@ ational procedure which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes left for the Le Trib@@ une de Gen@@ eve with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to wait if one of the driver will be shown .
was a battle avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the pro@@ secutor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said court st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver not to be held responsible .
in each of the two cases - which ran a person in the dark on the free@@ way - was decided that drivers did not assume that a pede@@ stri@@ ans run in the middle of the night on the free@@ way as it was in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ y@@ woman was acquitted of the neg@@ ligence , after having killed and killed a man who lay a man on the motorway in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year old victim had drunk and became un@@ conscious of the road and accepted the court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the court found that the polic@@ eman had rep@@ lied on an emergency call -- on a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the road had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely exceptional and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everybody who has more information on the incident occurred on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably hab@@ itable for the projec@@ tions of a new NASA climate change .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to detect the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that re@@ semble from cli@@ mates .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have recorded similar conditions with their hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ tight atmosphere .
scientists have previously thought that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin , inher@@ ent atmosphere and still twi@@ sted slowly .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet argu@@ ed probably more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to lodge life and protected from quick ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS @-@ model simulation , the slow rotation of the Venus will exp@@ ire their daily side of the sun for nearly two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which seems like a umbrella , to sh@@ iel@@ ding the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result are average temperatures , which are a few degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a story of Venus that resembles the evolution previously thought by planet researchers .
although it was probably hab@@ itable , the Venus was repeatedly exposed to a lot of heat and ultra@@ violet light during the years .
their oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and its water vap@@ or was taken away from ultra@@ violet light .
as their Hydro@@ gen dropped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus Climate Change in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy comes back as a coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy coming back as a Trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey operations by the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and introduced a part in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ado Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and re@@ marked that the association will immediately search for a new coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as chief trainer and vice President Of Ho@@ ckey operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ at@@ eness &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy spoke in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have long thought about how I could improve this team to give him more depth to give it more depth and it &apos;s needed to bring it to a higher level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to achieve this , the train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly adapted to the organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a participation right with decisions that affect the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are not currently being fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Tony on May 23 , 2013 , thank him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me this decision today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all what he did for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 , Roy was awarded the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the Best Trainer of the League .
he led the association to 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnes@@ ota and missed in every of the two last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of Fame Fo@@ wart , Roy has won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ werk take talks again , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour strug@@ gles regarding the re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea workers are exposed , while all the parties involved a round table round about the table , negoti@@ ators said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally operated on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the un@@ ites and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to re @-@ start the processing phase of the present battle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold some full day sessions in the coming weeks , beginning next year to restart the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wages of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has reduced the rates of its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s ratings are followed by a 10 percent reduction for on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company are needed to come through the down@@ turn .
shell has announced for its part of thousands of people and plans to give up plans to impos@@ e its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as a result of its business activities as a result of its meg@@ az@@ us@@ ory movement with the British Energy company BG Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are on the basis of lower crude oil prices under pressure , an economic situation that had to leave the European Union by the decision of the British in June . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish parliament manager Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the largest working disputes since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not only for few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected to spend new projects in the North Sea , compared to an average of $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler measures rotary rate of stars in the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ aden
the latest mission with the Kepler High teles@@ cope helped astronom@@ ers to gather the most complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star h@@ ades of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades .
the new data help to understand the astronom@@ ers , why stars in the star cluster are rotating at different rates as well as in what connection the rotation @-@ time rooms with the planet .
&quot; we hope that we experience the compar@@ isons of our results with other star@@ base , more about the relationship between the mass of a dying , his age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is situated 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the earth .
many stars in this cluster originated approximately 125 million years ago , reaching the adult age now .
you now turn the fastest .
these gri@@ pping @-@ stars have large amounts of star@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the stars of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
if a star is aged , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each death by recogni@@ zes the time between the appearance of a manifest star spot -- like sun@@ spots .
the latest catalog of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars are slower than the less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull is compar@@ ing the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower Pie@@ rou@@ ettes as smaller ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Ple@@ j@@ adas we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , while faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ aden is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare the qualities as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star cluster of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades offers a anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is much to us what we want to know more about how , when , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates and so to speak on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dancing shoes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail on their latest analysis of the rotary rates of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball @-@ Star begins
with Alex Rodri@@ guez , the tears ran faster than the US @-@ bas@@ eball @-@ star in the best days of Base Base .
after his emotional re@@ sign@@ ation , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will enter the T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays last time the Tri@@ k@@ ot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tell you Good@@ bye &apos; , the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable players of the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature on a tenth year contract showed him annually 27 million US dollars annually .
until the end of the conflict on December 31 , 2017 he will serve as consultant and youth coach - at a full salary .
as a player it counts Rodri@@ guez times with power .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) , and since 2005 he held the Yan@@ ke@@ es some milest@@ ones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays only two other bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics show similar values .
the 41 @-@ year @-@ old however is not likely to be included in the glory hall of the bas@@ eball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for so successful Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so the appearance is outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in 2009 , the super@@ star was called &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 , killing ster@@ oids .
in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to a settlement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis Sk@@ andal by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ guez is considered as the main susp@@ ect for years to gain power @-@ promoting funding through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done for the year 2014 even a pleasure , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his farewell days also don &apos;t run smoothly .
while many bas@@ eball legends have once again given the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ guez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; et@@ ched Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all Rodri@@ guez , who was married to the actress Cameron Di@@ az , and the relations with pop@@ star Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson , sympathy and sympathy of the fans of the Yan@@ kee @-@ Arch@@ riv@@ ale Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; sang the followers at the 4 : 9 defeat for Rodri@@ guez @-@ Team .
Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first d@@ oping cases
get caught : because of a positive d@@ oping sample , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Go@@ inski from Poland are not allowed to start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official d@@ op@@ pression cases .
one caught athl@@ ete had won almost a medal .
the first official d@@ op@@ pression prevented the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in front of the seventh competition period .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre obst@@ acle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight @-@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positively and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the anyway critic@@ ised athle@@ tics competitions this news arrives at the un@@ time .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de has been proved last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king means of d@@ oping substance .
the International Sport@@ Court CAS confirmed the Friday afternoon about its exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly , just at 0.@@ 09 seconds they missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Ch@@ en had to take part in the Pre@@ liminary about 50 m Freestyle .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association is taking the issue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en full cooperation among the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a Communication : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ Court CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history the IO@@ C is not the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the san@@ itation of athletes with positive cases .
also during the night of Rio , the news about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on to the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only declaration could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the athle@@ tic athle@@ tic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report it is said to act in the banned substance around the EP@@ O blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ agent .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was suspended preliminary , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should have been positively charged .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v reported immediately with criticism of the Ath@@ let@@ in .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men do not pull the right conclusions , &quot; he said , &quot; We are under observation , many have been excluded . &quot;
in this way , approximately every weight lif@@ ter may not be taken from the chron@@ ically un@@ loaded nation in Rio .
on Friday also the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on in the class up to 85 kg .
both deny the intake of taking both may not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athl@@ ete , Dan@@ ek@@ owa Case is another heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport .
the IA@@ AF world association had forbidden the complete Russian team up to an exception , due to systematic d@@ oping d@@ oping , also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produces many bad news .
in the swimming sport , earlier societies in China had taken care of heavy disputes between athletes .
the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t gra@@ b@@ bed the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle , I want to pass , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French Radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Sun was the centre of a debate with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for D@@ oping du@@ sters , &quot; said this .
in 2014 , Sun was positively tested on the Chinese championships on the tri@@ met@@ azi@@ de , but had to sit in a dre@@ ad@@ ful lock .
data kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ pres@@ sen h@@ ack@@ ers her ran@@ som
program@@ mers from black@@ mailing @-@ malware attack specific companies - and are successful in this process .
according to a recent survey of the malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of survey@@ ed companies have at least once , partly multiple victims of a attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already target of a ran@@ som@@ ware fun@@ nel .
40 percent of the victims were willing to use the bra@@ ins required by the perpet@@ rators to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alise their black@@ outs software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes to attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially pres@@ sive sol@@ der money is significantly higher than in private use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we currently monitor a fri@@ ghten@@ ing fast evolution of the malware software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Welt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most of the mal@@ ign@@ itions programs were designed to send advertisement .
then the offen@@ ders re@@ press software discovered for itself .
only private use was the goal of a change to company attacks in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it is seeking a long changed files like Word , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as to archives of images and videos .
these files are encrypted and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software will then be presented by the demands of the black@@ mail .
in order to get the final key code to the files , the victims must get money - mostly in the form of to@@ bit@@ ing Bit@@ coin .
but with private use the personal photo database is based on the game , companies are related to sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , damage is cancelled if a ran@@ som@@ ware beats .
22 percent of the affected companies reported revenue losses through Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to stop the business activity , in case of a case people were mort@@ al .
in Germany several hospitals already were victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened with the loss of acute infections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : pay not , it only encour@@ ages the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , their data will be back .
it is difficult for managers to reject the demands of the perpet@@ rators in the operation of stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure have been resear@@ ched and tested the contact with the black@@ heads and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators actually try to build a kind of customer service to obtain more money .
you explain your victims by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , direct access websites , or dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t free example files .
and individuals will be saved by few hundred Euros to payments , companies have to deal with hard and five @-@ digit sum@@ s to re@@ turn@@ around their data .
given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers are always professional and share the work , explains security experts Che@@ ster Wis@@ nie@@ wski from the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
it is more likely , however , that it is three or four persons .
the program@@ mers sell their malware software in the form of a software construction kit to the actual black@@ mail .
the former malware kits were created by the malware yourself , advice and additional tools purchased for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included is an adjustment system so that smaller configuration , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski .
the black@@ mail then look for other h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so , in one of the forums on the underground , the set is buying from a criminal and instru@@ cts the set to install the software on possible PCs as possible .
payment is made per certified machine .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als carry sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski .
Ran@@ som@@ ware &apos;s risk is now known by many companies that secure their data better .
over 50 percent of the companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes pol@@ ls trust that Ran@@ som@@ ware to be able to defend Ran@@ som@@ ware by File @-@ Back @-@ ups and Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are pursu@@ ing new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data is no sufficient threat to success is more , the perpet@@ rators , instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
this means the damage potential will be more often higher than before the type of data .
the perpet@@ rators may also take entirely new goals in the internet of the items of the grain .
on the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con , safety for@@ gers demonstrated how they could get connected thermo@@ stat with the Internet .
in the middle of winter , the release of such a blocked heating could certainly be a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ rators then block the entire production road in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a theme in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and daily du@@ sty
in the small HR @-@ V Honda will grab everything : a little SUV , a bit cou@@ pe and even the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform like the new jazz , is indeed very flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , passengers have a lot of place in the first row and in the second row , there is no place in either place .
the materials of the interior are well processed and work pleasant , only the cockpit side falls somewhat .
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l at the top of the top and 10@@ 26 l at reverse back @-@ rests , but there are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magic than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be fli@@ pped like k@@ ine@@ ering and thus offer storage space , which is elev@@ ated from the ground up to the ceilings 1,@@ 24 m high .
the boot space can be loaded well , however , the loading height with 650 mm is higher than with a comparable Peugeot in 2008 .
the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel engines with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas .
however , he might put his work somewhat qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4,7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another motor@@ ization : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a wheel drive is not offered .
the travel behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the steering must be somewhat direct .
the equipment is not desired in the &quot; Executive &quot; top version .
the City @-@ Not@@ ice Wizard is one of the security systems ( operates at the pace of 32 ) , the coll@@ ision of coll@@ ision .
the coll@@ ision war@@ ns sometimes irrit@@ ated sometimes , because he assessed many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coming objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote driver assistance works very reliably .
and the Smart Tem@@ po@@ re@@ gler re@@ acts to the traffic detection and thr@@ ottle the speed when needed .
but the complete connectivity is only available for top @-@ equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App Integration and More .
two USB@@ - and an HDMI @-@ jack lie beneath the arm@@ rest and therefore are somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who want not to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20000 Euro , including diesel from 23@@ 000 Euro .
the motors comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V Honda is offering a versatile and versatile car .
airline is not liable : down@@ fall on passenger quar@@ es
an airline is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the air@@ lift .
the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) is th@@ ink@@ able only if it is th@@ ink@@ able that typical for air traffic are th@@ ink@@ able .
the sm@@ ur@@ ger broke down in the overthrow of a kne@@ ec@@ ap .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a common chance of life , so the judgment .
the airline had to pay no compensation for the man .
cases of disease : when the organis@@ er
after their journey , travelers get back money , if the cause of the disease is doub@@ t@@ less in the hotel .
however , this is only the case if more than ten per cent of the guests have to show the same symptoms .
in the negoti@@ ated case a family was heavily damaged in diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting a family on the second day .
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their illness brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back on a defective cage which repor@@ tedly contam@@ inate the se@@ a@@ water .
the family was the view , the trip was defic@@ ient and compl@@ ained against the promot@@ er .
the claim@@ ers had no success in court .
indeed , the mil@@ eage in fact was defective .
but the organizer took to know only shortly before departure of the K@@ lä@@ ger .
until then , he had to assume that se@@ a@@ water was fine .
he did not hurt his information , so the judgment .
especially in the samples of water no imp@@ ur@@ ities were found .
the illness of several hotel guests - perhaps by cont@@ ag@@ ion each other - belonging to the general life of life .
there were only 38 people of 6@@ 91 guests .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , after the violence pursued by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people have worried about further attacks .
the state must be squ@@ ash and decided to react to terror@@ ists .
certainly : our country will not respond to the violence of the perpet@@ rators .
we won &apos;t allow the terror@@ ists to this triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an off@@ ender would have to leave the country , but increase security and strengthen the approval of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning to implement the proposals until the presidential election in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personal rein@@ forcement of the security forces , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a medium @-@ digit order over several years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be under punishment .
video surveillance is to be improved , the ceas@@ e@@ fire should be amended , especially the purchase of weapons added on the Internet .
the last much @-@ discussed uniform law for physi@@ cians should remain in accordance with de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to search for solutions in a dialogue with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trouble @-@ shaft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if the threat of the citizens can be decreased , he test@@ ified about mental ab@@ normal@@ ities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to counter@@ act a radic@@ alisation of refugees , the Minister holds even better social support .
teachers would have to be prepared better for dealing with trau@@ matic people .
for the prosecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD boss Gabriel said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the interior minister spoke clearly against action against action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an ear@@ piece for the sni@@ per in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fun@@ ke Media Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abol@@ ition of the double citizenship previously .
a general prohibition of whol@@ eg@@ ulation is not proble@@ matic for const@@ itu@@ tionally proble@@ matic .
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything you reject , and I lean back the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules in road traffic or for witnesses in court .
green @-@ Che@@ fin Simone Peter cast the Minister to sim@@ ulate power and action with new anti @-@ terror packages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Rie@@ x@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fle@@ et pro@@ ver@@ bs and a tighten@@ ing of the common law bring man no longer security in this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway junction
it looked regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here is a picture of November .
but this should change : the susp@@ ect is to be prolonged .
this is good news for all cars that go to traffic on the ambient road every night in the st@@ au when they drive over the free@@ way ( A 43 ) .
road construction works continued on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Street and the descent Wes@@ er Straße about 700 meters .
drivers can then go directly from the hammer street on the right .
the major advantage : the traffic shares early on which to improve the overall process on the busy sections of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit was the CDU faction in the District Münster @-@ West agency .
the ride on the train station annoying the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days the rear view goes back to the bridge over the Alber@@ go Road and sometimes also beyond .
the con@@ if@@ ers to the B 51 is shortly before the Wes@@ er Straße .
from here , traffic will only be transferred via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back in the thir@@ teen years ago .
the reason : static calculations have shown that the bridge does not have the necessary load capacity to absorb the heavy duty of heavy traffic .
as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the connected st@@ amping is ongoing , the competent national operation can not be said .
however , to reck@@ on with years : because the bridge has an official resi@@ due time of 20@@ 34 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the extension of the legal turn , the state company deliber@@ ately chosen the bu@@ si@@ est time in school holidays because with disabilities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site on Wednesday .
cross @-@ cultural journey : Culture &amp; schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of wood@@ school visited the theatre piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater now plan a musical project .
the N@@ ima &quot; Association allows you@@ ths to visit immig@@ rant and refugee background , cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited an idea of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible House &quot; of the Young The@@ aters Münster .
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; association , 19 students between eleven and 15 years visited the st@@ aging in the little house .
since the beginning of the year , the Club has been providing the cultural integration of young people with an immig@@ ration and refugee background , schools with Will@@ ys leave the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most of the young people of the class took place between September 2015 and March 2016 among other things in Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria into Münster and say little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ograph@@ ics , the scenic images and video animations it was possible to follow the scope of action nevertheless , so the press release of the Young The@@ aters Münster .
N@@ ima &apos;s association , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg , and the Young Theatre are working together in the upcoming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without escape and mig@@ rant background have been given the opportunity to visit professionally guided classes in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical education studies are in planning .
the &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; project continues .
given the increased refugee numbers , the association counts with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope in weather repair
the weather has made the star@@ ving sailors in the south @-@ west of Germany in the night for Friday a grain of the bill - but there is still hope .
the night had been bad because of clouds and rain , the chairman of the Ob@@ servatory of Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said to the Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we will certainly see lots of stars in the sky .
with the shooting stars it is person@@ alised that belong to the fastest constellation with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their names because they apparently come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which enters the North East .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening , one hur@@ ts forever . at night , one hour is awake at night , in the morning you can &apos;t think about sleeping .
that is anything but relaxing .
after all , people with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , has approximately one quarter of adult in@@ som@@ nia and more than ten percent emp@@ tied their sleep frequently or permanently than not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep problems ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there are various causes based on them , st@@ resses Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , board member of the German Society for Sle@@ ep and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
whatever you understand , the in@@ som@@ nia is , therefore , a single entry and a passage .
just that sleeping well you find many people as uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or in@@ sufficient , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the board member in the German Hou@@ ses Association in Var@@ el , says .
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
they can use organic , psychological or behavi@@ oral factors , but also medication .
not rarely is the sleeping disorder expression of another illness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is frequent , especially in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors would need each other .
whoever has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can be bad , is w@@ aking up every two to three hours and get to p@@ onder@@ ous , over all day problems and worry , give an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I sleep with sleep disorders ?
for who does not sleep well over a month in at least three nights a week , should be affected by the day , he should go to a doctor .
the imp@@ air@@ ment can look quite different : one is dis@@ rup@@ ted , tired , un@@ disturbed , has difficulty with attention and concentration , has trouble fluctu@@ ations or physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ ache .
to alle@@ vi@@ ate sleep problems , it is important to find out their causes .
as treatment options , among other things , cogn@@ itive behavi@@ oral therapy or medication - classic k@@ ill@@ ets only occur in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quire .
in Germany , Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etz@@ e , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Research Center at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , is barely keeping there in Germany .
therefore , if sleeping trou@@ bl@@ es@@ hooting is necessary , you should consult a doctor .
who can clari@@ fy with studies , whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should be in a sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for exam@@ inations in a sleep laboratory , medicine , for example , in snor@@ ing with respir@@ atory diseases , occurs at bed@@ bugs or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a passage , Fi@@ etz@@ e .

what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has decided on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V team at the Olympic team .
in December 2014 , he first brought gold at the First World Championships in Doha , while at the same time he exhibited his first world record .
now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler sum@@ med up his ex @-@ team @-@ mates in the cr@@ iti@@ que of his review .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country in which a € 20,000 € bonus gets and a jungle , 15@@ 0,000 € , no one should wonder about missing medals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the delivery system in the swimming sport is poor , the d@@ oping controls are very good .
thus , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and can &apos;t operate at the d@@ oping theme or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not say that the checks should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
wanted to start a com@@ eback already nine months before his first start to the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should also keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who cannot be checked for a certain period before the World Cup / OS of independent Controll@@ ers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , is not allowed to participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls for the choice of Hamburg that now operates an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of bags arrested
professional th@@ ie@@ ves at the airport Düsseldorf
civilian f@@ issu@@ res of Düsseldorf &apos;s police managed the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 .
the susp@@ ect had done several bags of bags and luggage .
at 21.@@ 30 civil servants in the area of the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport , a gang of police identified the police officer .
the two women and two men had committed several crimes since the middle of July and had been pract@@ ised and especially professional .
the specialists of the Criminal Com@@ miss@@ ile 34 allows the th@@ ie@@ ves who were entered into crimes committed by off@@ ences to Germany in order to prove four actions .
they carried off at a total of over 15,000 Euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; old buildings , a few lin@@ k@@ gs village , in between , and another head of pil@@ lows : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not look like at first sight , but the police counted it to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if one passes the road from the east to the west , one passes to the fields , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
to the facade of a grey house someone &quot; ugly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
opposite a Li@@ dl , which should also be torn down soon , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here by 2017 .
in recent weeks articles referring to this &quot; fashi@@ onable district , &quot; as the real estate company called Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , is illustrated in the last weeks with burning cars .
the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants of lease contracts , on the ground floor , are still spaces occupied and are used for events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially since the beginning of the year , the Berlin Wall of the Berlin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against police officers and the 94 were considered as a base of autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after on June 22 the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , had been evacu@@ ated with 300 police officers , cancelled the police for three weeks , un@@ locked parts of the street and took visitors to the house with the number 94 .
in the meantime , building staff renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin administration court decided that the clearing was illegal , and one day later police officers and workers under the le@@ ver of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
this afternoon , the road becomes peaceful : parents go for walking with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tained in front late Sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens lie .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who were here three children , are mainly generated by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the skin research they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wished himself a majority of police in a v@@ andal@@ ous left .
the tren@@ ch that the Berliner Dom@@ sen@@ ator and the police make up between house owners and their neigh@@ bors , obviously not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East of Berlin was a traditional work@@ horse , which also compared to the rest of the city a low average salary , and has a high risk of poverty .
also house networks and the native living projects have long been held to the pine forest : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied by the former GDR , including nearly the whole Main@@ zer road close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
as the main@@ tain@@ er had been evacu@@ ated in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and still occupied by people who had occupied them at 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become increasingly important to the magnets for tourists and sel@@ ections from all over the world : living with them from DDR @-@ periods and former household covers with their pine trees .
this is also noticeable by the rental rates that have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : you can recognize them in the raised discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were subjected to dyes .
no other road was mentioned as often together with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
a reason for that not all neigh@@ bors who consider the issue could be , that it is not necessarily concerned by crime : crimes such as bodi@@ ly harm are according to polic@@ emen almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the biggest part of off@@ ences make experts acc@@ us@@ ations , tend to make newly built and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a building house for 17 years apart from the controversial 94 , there may be no talk of un@@ certainty .
as for violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bors who would not have been this .
even the famous burning cars can &apos;t give it any longer in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the studied Archit@@ ect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er Street - and remained .
that &apos;s why it was so important that local residents got their way back : from police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly the deadline sho@@ res take over the district .
but in the eyes of inhabitants like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to leave them away : due di@@ vest@@ ment of new buildings in former buildings that displ@@ ace old inhabitants .
&quot; of course , these are con@@ domin@@ iums , which are not interesting for many , here are more people who are not so well @-@ kept , &quot; she says .
&quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not be thei@@ rs . &quot;
but what should we do if one never list@@ ens to anybody ?
there is frustr@@ ation on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer is little understanding for drawn structures , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer little understanding : the hood and the left scene were part of the Kie@@ z .
who draws , should be aware of that - just like someone who gets in a pub area , complain about noise .
all persons presented with names have therefore requested not to be called with their right name
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee community
An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in the matters of integration and organizer .
in addition she is a social worker on site .
An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee community for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social educ@@ ator supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she looks as an contact partner for all players : refugees , working group health , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine Customer of the Working Group indicates that the hon@@ our@@ able more than thank@@ ful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le now is to have the fans of wool , which has a problem above all .
thus some - less sp@@ ott@@ led than rather on the multitude of desired tasks , meant - meant that management wanted to leave the job .
we were looking for an administrative expert with a talent for languages and people , coupled with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social labour , an active member of Woll@@ is@@ chs@@ au .
but administration work is not its central area , means An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
mainly to organization , work with people on @-@ site and behind the scenes and network correc@@ t@@ ness .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been present for around six weeks .
she mat@@ ures a 50 per cent position for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; said Reg@@ ine Customer , that An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is an honorary citizen and full @-@ party actors .
there are big and small issues , organiz@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
soon new containers are available in the Was@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem has been to find apartments for connecting flights which have been acknowledged .
the municip@@ alities are responsible for connecting cables .
they need to accommodate refugees in your own or hired living rooms .
the costs for building , rent or renovation of these accommodations must take the municip@@ alities themselves .
the responsibility is alternat@@ ely from the rural centre and the job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his place .
the search has been designed as very difficult for some time now .
this is de facto the management of no private apartments .
it has not been working until now , on private apartments , so D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common apartments must be considered as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspectives is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed home base , training places , training places , school places , one @-@ euro jobs and excursions for refugees and migrants that have to be established or established .
&quot; more seats would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine client .
many work in the building yard or help home craftsmen , perform non@@ profit work - and the motivated and very neat as An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reports .
it hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this does not only mean work .
the day ow@@ es a fixed structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a state experience .
so it offers offers like sport , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also manage management and hon@@ our@@ able .
it is central that the refugees feel the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you need to explain the refugees , that it lasts and they can bridge over time , for example with language courses .
who would like to develop the feeling that he could not help in Ur@@ bach could not work and be un@@ profitable , he will never be able to integrate herself .
the clear majority were motivated .
but the problem cases are honest , &quot; people are honest , &quot; people with which nothing goes . &quot; the work of deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
all this has been a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : do the two after recent adv@@ ances are afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ ve may call it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if they were missing , they will not fail to exclu@@ de them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensitive .
such inci@@ dents are also subject of the refugees .
they had the fear that the attacks they were able to bring them completely in demand .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
thus , main and honorary citizens must show on site and in the region after activities .
they always in the background so that soon a new impact of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a limit ?
this question is clear to answer , the policy is sh@@ aken .
actually , it is un@@ fair to place them locally .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived there where we want to , &quot; says An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine Customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher often have been utilized to integrate the previous men r@@ ational .
at present , there are about 100 people , mainly young men .
but if people are in need of ad@@ versity you must agree to them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there is no easy answers .
