<seg id="1">Clintons and Trump economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - which is both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two U.S. Presidential applicants are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The matter of the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep the doubts rather small in the case, and warns against the state of the economy - with taxes and regularings." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to control the economy and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">By contrast, he would be quite different, claimed to have become a bump.</seg>
<seg id="9">To regain regulators, he will make for far reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private persons and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to fulfill, he has disadvantaged chances to open, and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore taxes for the rich would increase, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">In the moud, Trump and Clinton say almost at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate makes even the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "governmental investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are refused by the nationalist teethy wings of the Republicans." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">For Trump, there might be partisan discussions yet.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are more significant.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and up-driven coal promotion in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thus, oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris Climate Agreement wants to announce.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "in contrast, Clinton wants to strengthen and demand the renewable energies with its investment program:" "" "a country will create the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want that we are."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even with international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazione trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time both US doesn't want to isolate foreign trade, but simply protect us from American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be paid more then, even Clinton is required.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, The minimum wage has to be raised, then he says he could not change.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the taxation policy of both camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one hand, Trump, who wants to boost the economy and the citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics only keep him, so the budget deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand Clinton stands that at least the rich wants to pay more tax, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every winged woman has experience with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs for women who flee alone, almost from everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house provides sanctuary.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen we sit four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby that is at most a year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in his arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He rocks with big eyes curious in the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother starred onto the tabletop.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until they notice that it is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene works normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the director of Condrobs, a carrier for social welfare services in Bavaria, and deals with the topic women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are winged.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in Munich in one of the few decentral hotels for single-winged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs opened up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich's Aid Association.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are 60 people living there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it is not exaggerated to say," "" "every woman that arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence," "" "says Bahr." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "men flee because of wars, because they are politically persecuted because they are tortured or death, or because their families will send them as hopes for Europe." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">In women persuaded other reasons for the escape: "many stealing it secretly because they don't see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their home, they have made experiences with sexual violence, forced marriages, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">She continues it on her.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run this continues.</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, to demand a bottle of water for a bottle of water is no rarity," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believes that when they arrive in Germany as soon as they arrive in Germany, Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee camps would often be considered as inferior and worst.</seg>
<seg id="32">This leads to about 90 percent of women who live in the residential area of Munich are traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "some of the children are certainly not created voluntarily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "or they don't dare to speak openly about the living, because the shame is too great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they are often not too busy, it needs more lodgings just for them, calling Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">Seven District governments in Bavaria are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question, whether from a similar project as in Munich, in its jurisdiction, some respond with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">There is no such thing in the Oberpfalz region and Oberfranken.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Schwaben alone, winged women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, pressing the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Oberbayern, Lower and Mittelfranken there are in some communal accommodations or own houses only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations only for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "the committee" "" "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" "" "in the European Parliament also urges that women have to be separated from men." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study which was published for the Committee, it says: "it is very important that men and women are separated."</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "lack of privacy or men and women are accommodated there, can be - continually - violence against women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Especially the shower rooms should be separate and accessible for women, stands in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "" "" "how much the women feel this need, you can inquire at the rush there will be at the house in Munich." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "the leaders of the assistants have called upon their union to approve new labour measures in their disputes regarding a new contract." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) demanded its entire Council, approve more labor disputes from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC told that there would have been a minister to the concerns relating to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">Assistance and medical students have agreed in July on the rejection of a contract which has been agreed with the BMA.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of Foreign Relations"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture, which ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "the leaders of Russia and Turkey came on Tuesday to give his hands and proclaim an official end of the eight months of ongoing war of words and economic sanctions." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin accepts his Turkish opposite bank in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception, I do not forbid that Ankara wants to pay this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a blow, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smiles were shalant and barely any warmth, even for its restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly from his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report a whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the next day a newspaper complained that Erdogan would have been advertised as it would never happen somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="11">His enthusiasm seemed to tell me rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But Russia's President of Russia won't forget that Russia's state of state had nothing forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his quotes: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was walled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin told him and accused Ankara of being in his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was even bigger as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetroen rebuild will be difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the nationally controlled media held a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed like the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "the accusations from senior officers, that Erdogan's own family have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, which were controlled by the so-called Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">He has fought this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message heard that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting only took place because Putin got an excuse from President Erdogan, which he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needed first and foremost all friends who he can get after he had revealed during a failed coup d'etat of nearly His Amber.</seg>
<seg id="28">Again terror attacks on Turkey also rocked him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially to ban charter lines which usually take several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel agents and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They are counting on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the TV predicted fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "tourists stay there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is raged in the West because it responds to power to power in power as weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "to this end, the continued anger over the accession process of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike is to benefit from the cool atmosphere and decrease the relationship of Turkey to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Russian President won a bonus in Ankara to claim a bonus for the attempted coup d "état in Ankara following a attempted coup d" état.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is a self-understanding for Moscow, that himself has a profound fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "the summit meeting in this glittering palace in the sea made it possible Russia and Turkey which described me an analyst once described," "" "Alliance of Foreign Relations" "" ": two countries coming from the west and are badly dealt with and now allied." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still vast differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently announced the role as a peace maker, but Russia and Turkey support both opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks both presidents on the press conference said they hadn't even seize the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey avoided deliberately to answer a question about its differences, while Putin decided to emphasise it.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no unique consensus about where a common denominator can be found to Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months an open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disasters than NATO member Turkey, it is certainly better that the two leaders are talking to one another.</seg>

<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff came back on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only few of them are convinced - especially, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So what's the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>

<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidium manager for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov did the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before that he was deputy prime minister and minister of defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, as Putin was chairman of the Federal Constitutional Service (FSB), he was appointed KGB and was appointed Ivanov to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin arrived in power he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become the second term president of Russia, as a third term Putin would blow against the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, nearby allies of Putin's, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teen and child are no longer going to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time on monitors, in the last decade of many bemoths.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, it is about getting people from the sofa and be more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was at the beginning of the TV, then on video games and lastly on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, it is great to see that technology and activities are non-connected with each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I go to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, a app which is based on the characters that first created for the video games in the 1990s (later developed a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">As many phenomena of popculture, interest in the release of game in the US, Australia and New Zealand early July was something.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the server was overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon shall have more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>

<seg id="19">Those who exercise regular sports, reduces his chances to develop cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful to Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open, making them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friends on the hunt.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine at the Women's Olympic Games in the Turns and this is more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I have been at every summer Olympics in 1984 and the USA had never been dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly, this team has three turner, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who had been inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, which is Aly Raisman, the Jedin is and Madison Kocian, the Cathokin, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the United States.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic culpic presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one was one of the female Turneri an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This indicates strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they unexpected, but masterful Gymastics suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won with an individual campaigning event for women gold.</seg>
<seg id="14">Man member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We do not experience the tip of this sport, but that way gyms may not look out around the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it in the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five," "" "because the next Olympic champion will only have four turner in the team. besides, it is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainee." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks so that Turns can be a expensive sport and Turner at first place in private gymnasts, which can be maintained by parents, for training, setup, travel and hotel costs (for the trainer and their Turner and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these trainers lie in wealthy suburbs, which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, Turner will receive a total training and a long term commitment to families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained athletes since they started with the Turning.</seg>
<seg id="22">We need to be inspired to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to enable a service and easily accessible trainers.</seg>
<seg id="23">I was set up for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">For my events we have offered free and affordable turnes in Harlem for more than 15.000 young people (especially black and ispanic) and trained national and international victors.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer high quality gymnastics to learn from this great Olympic sport and to benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination provides life for life as well as for schooling and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, who bring thousands of young girls to interest for the turnes and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's so important to take part in the sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holes of the Olympic team golds and thank you, so many young girls are motivated by a different background to get their way to becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller lodged an immune system and dignitlex to a serious test - by sending some of the most polluted places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel autor Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk is shorten his course on a Euro bill, one of the railing on the Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a train toilette and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before withdrawals of each object he used a Luminaire to show up and to show what it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "but the experiment described under the title" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner strength" "" "brought some surprising results for daylight." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea to degaze the button of a train toilette, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely disgusting, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright talked with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he drained, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Wright became known to test the inability of his Darfur by travelling around the world and ate intrinsically as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations to rinsing toilets of toilets, the task assigned his immune system definitively among a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "he told the film:" "" "as a child, I was relatively unworried about what my health concerns and I put all things in my mouth, earth, worms, and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was just committed to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he was rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>

<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminometres of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to crash after their Luminometres was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have a lot of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner strength," which shows the bacterial population at different locations like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "This is the worst thing I have smell in a toilet, close." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick it here, because it is insolitary here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company statuses Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to really offer consumers really something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that's fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led mad brainstormings by doing that we were saying "Lass us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in intestinal health will become a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to place them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we managed to provide more information about it in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Tom Hakala, who led the film direction, added:" "" "let me not say" "" "I have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I need to lick it, as the eccentric Russian toilet, which is shown in the film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course, there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to leaky and others, with which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we have included some of these dirty leakin paintings." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by the year 2015, 84 percent of all surveyed lactic acid bacteria, in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines, and 58% said they had to use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the indigenous people don't get anything from the summer campaign - and the tourists from North Rhine-Westphalia shall not select the Diet.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">The country elections are not once again held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Heavy Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Aside after so far it does not go: summer holidays, heat and land setting - that bites itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The natives, who are to be persuaded by the ballisteners, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most tourists who are in the country are on the road, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="8">Practical problems: in the holidays are helpers, the posters hang up, air balloons inflate, flyers and end up voices, only need to wipe out.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until the 4th of September 2016, the election and final holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to leave the right of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern once more of the people over the day.</seg>
<seg id="10">The first phase, if you can say that at all, has just started.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it also concerns a little: Prime Minister, Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strong newcomer AFD cuts and what remains at the end of coalition foods.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old, and heads of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from its large posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, distributes rose and chats a little with the people as it did even his legendary karmic predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, sailors got cold feet and gives chancellor Merkel at the astonishment of the AFD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "her refugee policy," "" "We create" "" "accelerates the rise of the right splash, which will probably cost him the beautiful office." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU, with its nickname, the interior minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced as it is, if one makes a wrong time at the right place of election.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has two chancellor Angela Merkel invited to major reports; Angela Merkel is in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority of other federal states," "" "complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary of the CDU of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, just in NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it is too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise the Nordost-CDU would largely avoid the usual choices on market conditions and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">This, so Kokert, plays only a "subordinate role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noted that you are crumbling the base in the country that it must be very strict, to find a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are like the left, the SPD, the Green: in the ties of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "the Council of the CDU campaign Kokert on his fellows however is also self-exposed:" "" "they must go to where there are people: Dorffeste, Golden weddings, each birthday party must be exploited." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is standing on the game, Sellering established its SPD for a particularly dedicated election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys the Socialists and Democrats were at last with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and only close to the AFD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the election of 2011, the SPD had still clearly gained 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, might be able to put the jump into the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue from the holiday-need and impose its election campaign largely on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign" is the president of Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise green elections are taken on track search for local stimulus among tourists.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gaek, the top candidate, curvt just with a houseboat ride through the mecclenese lakes and finds it even nice.</seg>
<seg id="36">Their impression: "elections in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed of speed with which the B 27 is renovated, there is nothing to complain.</seg>

<seg id="6">There is no default.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be moved on the weekend to the half-time according to the south, until the end of October, everything should be completed.</seg>
<seg id="8">The opposite is also commended for the construction works, approximately if it goes to the furnishings of comfort entrances.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was moved to south on Monday and also the barriers of the Aspergyway in Ofandingen was abolished and the connection to Rottenburg is once again, the traffic situation is relaxed inside the place.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofandingen to the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The travel traffic due to the place seems to be back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there was partially considerable discomfort," says the principal manager Florian King, responsible for the transport management of the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstraße Street, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many roads searched and more familiar to their Navi as the signage.</seg>

<seg id="20">For business people at the B 27 it is just a little consolation that for customers from Rottenburg now the street is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the cards, business people do not hesitate to consult.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27 restoration of them led to sales gains, everyone, whom one asks, can look through.</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, the policy would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt was responding to a request from Göhner if there would be a financial compensation unless we benefited from the advantages of the location at the B 27. now they also have the disadvantages which are due to the restoration.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows of other country circles, where a little more generous was handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been settled since 1715, he refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regular guests now have less frequently obsled due to the complex traffic guidance.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it is also woken somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="42">That his regular clientele came back after the refurbishment, Göhner has no doubts.</seg>

<seg id="25">And with some points - in the unequal treatment of patient for example - the question arises: what does it actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the topics refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be expressed in detail that the attacks of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who buys sound plates?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely, middle age, love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you come to comment on the pseudonym, in order to splitted it under the pseudonym non-allvelihood of men with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the many spoken reproduction of records does not want to welcome a boom in millennials, which is due to the realities of physical objects, but to Midlife Nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a record are all the foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most probable buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also no hordes through Hobbysammers - it has an emotional meaning: older turntables are keeping their feelings more for themselves (56% vs 53%) and enjoying it alone time to spend time (69% vs 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "if this blog would be a news report on television, I would like to follow the camera in a humble street in Soho, a modest grey suit, before I stand on, holding my hands and something like:" "" "so let's take a closer look at it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Although the Heart of Sohos is slowly emptied to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were based - there are still a handful of fantastic record shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera team to turn the camera for the next part, in which I stand up close to several men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from sister Ray (data: two young women, three men middle ages) into Reckless Records (number of data: eight men, middle ages, a woman probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess it," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not following him at home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy records, which he could not afford to buy and again buy items that he sold when he was young and plea.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70's, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things in which I was probably a little too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees to buy the plates, rather introverted and would like to spend time and adds: "I smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my disaster.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with sister Ray, believes that many customers who hits from YouGov.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the medium, people who have heard about the comeback and to get started to buy her old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the talks which I have led, people usually read about 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now, sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to trailers of a specific age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to detect that record shops offers a calming community of peers.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers suffered from the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to pull back the stability of familiar sound boards, from objects, the happy youngsters.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a emptiness or possession of materially possessions than a kind of comfort," THZ says.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is my collector for me, and I think it is so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to explore spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" flutes a staff from a record stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by ICM in April that almost 50% of people bought a record last month they haven't heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out that 41% have a turntable that they never use while 7% of those who buy one plate, do not have turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the message, I would probably look very worried as I leafed through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (number of people: three men middle age) has noticed a "" "" dry aspect "" "" of the Revival. "" "</seg>
<seg id="39">"somebody came only recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead Record board so I can put them on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product heavy, less musicastic.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntable."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older who can only come slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has the sound plates for almost a whole floor, has an entertaining audience than I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples about 70, tourists, pictures make, teenagers and women middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops, Wild Beasts latest synthesizers and sexcheted pop instead of experimental Jazz has grown from the loudspeakers - it's good to see such diversity of customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strange but nagging psychic traumata are hard to determine if one stands next to someone over 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs around in the shop for several minutes and sees the variety of plates that are sold for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is rather a display mannequin than a bulk purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, so the collecting of records is not a real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in other way, but the beauty of plates is... "it drives with a sigh sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop, of which it is said that a new generation of sublime players should have inspired: urban Outjams.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I admit to muffing the jeans hotline, I watch a group of young teenagers that will group for a moment around Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter will think to buy a Croats turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody can look at her - maybe because they are purely decorative, some as far as it is impossible to touch it.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering the fact that any attraction for these items will mean more money for the industry and could send a few customers to the Deep Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is the one that gives most for luxury objects like plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even when my research shows that the results of YouGov do, let them say, at least in record shops in Soho, the great number of female collectors and turntables exist, which exist in reality, record shops and online.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not by strolling through record shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while starting the starring view of an inconceerie, 30-year-old false moderator, who rises from middle aged over the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">One French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live down.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week the authorities argued in Calais, that the state should incinerate 72 valiant businesses within the camp of goods that sell cigarettes to energy drinks, selling hairdresser services or to sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture are argued that these places would be torn down because they would be a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and health.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups divided the court that the businesses and restaurants are important, as the free meals offered by the state supported association and other groups not offer enough foods for growing numbers in the camp.</seg>

<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the remorsel was the Jungle Book Kids' café of the camp, which is generally operated and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice to asylum seekers, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's Rasps have to adjust to the next generation speed monitor: in various federal states, among others in Hessen und Brandenburg, new flash devices are tested, the Temposurs will be particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic effective Enforcement trailer of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on motorway construction or to smooth bridge with temporary speed, there are often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary blitzer for adherence to speed limiting.</seg>
<seg id="5">A permanent mobile construction can however be too dangerous or complex.</seg>

<seg id="7">With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously via several tracks.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limit, as well as transit times after time, transport strip and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at the 7-er Rugby came in the final on Thursday evening to a sudden stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji divided a master class in the handling, Side-Stepping, curpress, line winding and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic champion in any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was failed by the not too bad TrostAward of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on this day - and they could be very proud of their efforts in that tournament in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinct defeat of the boks, 7-5 in the semifinal on the same day could fall back in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But irrespective of this, Fiji had produced a 15-man-team in the form of this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not be that at least a Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck. Fijis chief trainer Ben Ryan, the former boss of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult journey behind them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they just lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This snap gets hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji had very wonderful and left the attacks on the GBs of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. at, as if one would run in driving buses. the World Series winners went up 5-0 to the top, when Osea Kolinisau moved in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A heurrazed Towns of Mitchell stopped the mount of Mann-Nakarawa to reach a third gate, but it has only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua reached a touch down at the right corner, and it stood 0-17 for the UK.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the resurgence and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou prefers through further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion was about 29-0 to break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still dazzle.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is like that too.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB guided the basic changes to the half-time and closed the fijianic gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the ratios of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova went through a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long been fighting for the South Seers, whose fans sank and dancing on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playful gjis approach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the i-tittle with another try in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whisting sounds that Fijis hugged and GB kickte struck down in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji had conquered Japan in a semi-final with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a small semi-finalmatch from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the ground in the first half of the front, but Dan Norton interrupted the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliantly late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-ASIDE team secured the gain - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no engine in colour than those games, giving that which you want.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first beat down to the last, 220 hard hieves that go down into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who sat in the boat, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainers Robin Williams was there, as she ruined the second Olympic champion of two without a tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of the British sport that put such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all, her 39.ter undergoing operation, which is unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlete that glides over the surface with the elegance of swarf, which is not reflected by the nature of the Triumphal Arch.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the rowing is a battalion of willing helpers to make up the difference, and no one was more hilarious than the trainer, which would not survive this day at all, when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do this, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been quite a bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little bit of the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio were lucky that he could start treatment in early 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if this is at all the right term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so it soon had to go better.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran at the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="18">That's how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing itself is a challenge, but it makes it a bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the inmediate of victory, their first thoughts passed to Williams, who had just spent a little bit more than anyone else, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "Stanning who was as captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in an employment in Afghanistan," "" "I was this week an emotional wreck. that's perhaps a bit extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It just repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and Robin worked with Robin.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be no one, therefore a massive thanks to him is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would not have a better person to practise or want a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning lost no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a tough rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up, Stanning and Glover had much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen cried, "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It's really important to let yourself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we weren't out of making something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted no fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear next week at a wedding, your own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>

<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>

<seg id="5">By the way, they do something good in their health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">For singing is equal from several perspectives, a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior citizen.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the chorus and share with peers the joy of music describing Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Regular combinations can take part and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and familiar structures are frequent at the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience also made Ursel Kipp in her choir," "" "To arrange and organize himself on the others - a choir is a very special form of being." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="13">Those who demands his lungs regularly doesn't come out of the purest in everyday life either.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it comes to get the sound of the voice in the age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In elderly people, singing often has a special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of Seniors-Organizers.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, common singing had a much higher job, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, it explains.</seg>

<seg id="18">With lyrics and especially melodies, the disease of the disease itself entangled to long past events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, the head also requires a special power, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">Simultaneously, on the own voice and to focus on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people living alone that are living alone, not just concentrating on yourself.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition, which one drives through singing in the chorus, means Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a fantastic praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem is also growing by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show itself: if I take a lot for something, I will better and watch over myself - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing with singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Who wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent, he says Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You do not sing alone - at 50 sinful people who hears, when a tone goes beside it?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the right offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If a man sings from the awareness of an old child, one can simply join them.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Who wants to sing in a church choir, can directly turn to the church or church leaders.</seg>
<seg id="33">There are many people's choirs to be found via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you don't have access to the Internet, your family, friends or neighbors will ask for help with the internet search.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who desire to sing, should join with a choir, avenged hackler.</seg>

<seg id="27">However, the allegations of the past year have raised the question, to which President Obama can rely on Central Command for the honest operations of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the Islamic State remind of the Islamic State of more than ten years ago, when CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a lot of evidence against the recommendations of many analysts in Iraq, and had little time on it to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker played a key role in the insurrection against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker stated that contrary to government officials should not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since this provisional refineries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after they shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockeyteam of women in a match against India that Americans won at 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their goals in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, this is obvious: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are contested in their group with the Britons at first place, which remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will succumbed on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which both teams will gain the first and second place within their group.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will see the strong Holderland a little longer out of the way that the other group leads.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go out on Saturday, Americans have triggered a surprising host by their success story, four years after they ended up in the last London Games on the last 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania on, and had the first time with three years a hockey team in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years it became the national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">It missed the Olympics in 2008, since they could not qualify for the combader.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, where she went for her and her team.</seg>

<seg id="16">"" "" "" "a change of culture, a mental change and a physical exchanges," "" "said Bam." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the job creation in London, which we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We can carry out the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the goal in the first half of the game with a return from the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was gone without victory in the tournament, but the team showed a surprisingly tough and held the pitch of 1-0 up to the third quarter, until Bam took the game into her hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">It carried a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and crossed the ball to get the Americans a 2-0 leadership.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last fourth.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the tournament for the keeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to rent a gate in any of the previous games.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of Trampolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late as it is, the Olympic Games are.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constantly and inevitable, a fast relay between competition and strives.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the olympic fackel himself would be a burning staff that is to protect the swimming pool to the race to the triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the talking of your neighbours in the waiting period without Simone Biles, Katie Lechty or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a female whistage with dimples, could not be allowed to be sent to the Prime Time to be sent to the Prime Time, being a swimmers, Turner or even Feeder.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in the Olympic trampoline for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shadow, are the sports that are not universally recognized: air pistols, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make a modest arguments for my particular favourite, let me get attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the jumping on the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had made its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years has been so scary that many were asked, did not know that it is at all an Olympic port.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA has sent a competition at the competition, it has never again won a medal in the jumping on the trampoline until 2012, who made it until the end of the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share their prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian to share the men.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend her gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The jumping on the trampoline has a certain exterior charme, partly because it sounds for the unsolved ear for a Clownsschule as the for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert but only an bound enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has a humoral potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never swollen ascend - but also the Grazie of the Turnaround and diving, the two sports that essentially combines.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means a lot like "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">The upcoming winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot nearly up to 30 foot in the air and have to land a number of falling movements (threaten, hens and sage) before they end up on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They will be judged according to the official Olympic Champion after the finish, difficulty and 'flight time. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, are competing in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists are hoping to go forward in their quest for gold, faster, upward and above, sometimes up to the destination, sometimes up and back, down and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but in the TV broadcast another category: die the world or the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="28">The scrubbing struts is nobel, admirable, even fanatical - and there is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel when trying these games as something fatiguing.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the target.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she jumped off, seemingly heavy as a astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then back again.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a contest, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectic attack on the target, no vaults to the distance, only the dreamy, elegant uplift of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's so Zen like the competition for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifying and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming of 13.00 Eastern Time; the men's on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will run the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days starting at 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">At the heart of Olympia-Mania they promise a calm, nice moment, a very good thing that is likely to overlook in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase of consciousness can be reached only through the attaining and objectification of male athletes, according to the The Wall Street Journal pre-beat - then Mr. Dooley anticipates his new fanbase.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protesting" in Ethiopia, Long, a group of U.S.</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia are struggling with the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testify that zig protests were killed during clashes with the police in firearms.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia ready to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months protests against the government shook the country and expanded in more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was merciful to human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen were shaking up unarmed and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security personnel were forced to strike young people with sticks, while these were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN agency for human rights now demands an incoming investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold that country and in future it will even be more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a Research Group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and is appreciated by the West in Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror across the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if any, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded in considerable tempo.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pendulum in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia had anything other than a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continuously expanded their repression by the government - the opposition in the country was constrained; the dissidents were effective for silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in jail, or put into the Wages of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints which cover everything from the ground use until the stranglehold in relation to power of ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a significant critical election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions rise along the border of Eritrea; a fight for these cunchy, controversial line called for hundreds of life.</seg>
<seg id="28">They fear that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were more or less forced by the turmoil, to profit the turmoil and to arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of biting after years of ankles will now explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians had been able to communicate through the social media as a smart phones were becoming more and more frequent and improved their Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocked access to Facebook and Twitter what they are in regular intervals, especially at protests, many people still can communicate more about Internet proxies that hide and where they can stop.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians encountered that they were gathered together to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two biggest forces in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not as natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since eons, the Amharas, who mainly come from Aegeopia to the majority of Christian, in politics and the economy, as they exploited the Orosei, many Muslims are and live in flatland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are there to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in the regions of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and that are dominant in the military, in the secret services, in trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "" "" "Mr Meles, a former rebel leader until his death in a non-public disease in 2012, Ethiopia's prime minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that it was especially engaged to perceive early indications of dissatisfaction and to use special arranges to process opponents and make them damaging.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "in the present regime, it lacks a conflict of conflict," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">When Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he is not enjoying the confidence that controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia had experienced such an upheaval in 2005, after thousands of elections were protesting according to the information of analytics by the government and were subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">While the following Razors were killed many protesters, even if it was less than in the past few months, and this time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructures, such as the new pendulum campaign, as well as for their measurable advances in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this did not prevent the intensification of the internal mischief of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharical city, run by Tigray and the hate opposite the Tigray is still practised in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the US and other Western allies bring allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for drongs on the neighboured Somalia, even if they recently told that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West wants to support democracy clearly, he doesn't want his ally to breaks into a volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">This, "Mr. Abdi said," is a very thin walk. "</seg>

<seg id="14">At the end of July he drew a strong criticism, when he meant, the Russians should be greeted with Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he explained later, "Of course I said the sarcastic."</seg>

<seg id="19">A new poll by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a guided tour in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head-race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump in general tries to not excuse himself for his provocative postings, he often accused his critics to disrude his or her sense of humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while keeping attention in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump joke has brought his loyal involvement in the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative his sayings may be like provocative.</seg>

<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with people," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>

<seg id="25">For years, the focal point of the American kitchen was, became a rarely served luxury.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland - the oldest cyclone is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland is usually only coming to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on the ship of the Sanna research ship.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and is swimming with a good 1km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland we only get offspring with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Greenland shark is based on the ground of the North Atlantic coast, an average of 1.220 meters on average.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it reaches, it accelerates five meters long Tier at a tight 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This mindset of long-solitude, however, seems to be a reality concept for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reports in the professional journal "Science" at any time from a Greenland member that could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness," "" "said Alexander Schwitlein at the Max Planck Institute for demographic Research in Rostock this span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary head of evolution has long been thought that Greenland will become stone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence is lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grönlandsharks are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the polar sea ahead of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers have little known about the lifestyle of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time of time pentempo, in front of Svalbard, six animals with a broadcaster.</seg>
<seg id="18">These sharks still make the prey: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seals, another one had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe they hunt them sleeping animals or patrouters the cause of the ice cream and look for cadaver, which leads from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland sharks, fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long while the largest 502-centimeters measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, they analyzed with the carbon-14 method the line core of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye relief already occurs before the birth of sharks, which are contained in it later, are no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lenticular.</seg>
<seg id="25">Her birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons tried to carry out greater quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In contrast with 220 cm of its length, the lentil core contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, in its investigation, in 2012, it should be celebrated its 50th birthday.</seg>
<seg id="27">In contrast, all major Greenland sharks had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lenticular form, which is created through cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-Clock for an 493-centimetre-shark showed an old of 335 years, while the record-shark with 502 Zentimeters might be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark-female only got offspring if they are longer than four meters.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to their length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Because one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably determined at the threshold for sexually mature and its age with 156 years was determined to get Greenland with the multiplication of at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">There is no coincidence that such methane lees live in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The old record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland, caught in his bacon at the neck a 120 year-old harpoon top, was caught on Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures often the organism of the animals lived on a flame of flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">They do so later - and alerts slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are also very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much faster than its surface, due to the animal warmth.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal is therefore dangerous and should concentrate on focusing as many descendants if possible," "", "explains the evolutionary biologist Schwitlein as early as possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">In contrast, a very big animal should rather invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="8">Hoys retires a gap that tried to close the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man in which they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that unfolds now.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminum schlaze of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers of workers - stand up in the game since the asset owner will withdraw the energy supply contract, as they shared all delivery contracts, as the energy company provided.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to be commissioned by the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A payout for 20 years expires in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of ALCOA in Portland are situated on the deck.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs are direct and indirect - due to a closure may be at risk.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to Dominoeffectin, since the melt of around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victoria consumes.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 ALCOA completed the Point Henry melt, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power station last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt of ALCOA in Portland loses money and risked a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the year-long speculation in the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar, and lastly on the basis of the power supply for the system.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, who supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A plant in Latrobe Valley, told that three further owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is located in the majority owned by ALCOA and Alumina, from which the Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp are holding smaller portions.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant in Portland is still used, which means a further physical demand for electricity by the melt," the company shared with them.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "AGL continues to assume that the" "" "secured transactions" "" "will have to enter into force as of November 2016." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have signed a 12-month period of notice, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "from hence, AGL assumes that the contracts in the business year 17 will contribute to the revenue," "" "said the supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on income to AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong current markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to AGL, the value of the stipulated contracts in the amount of $187 million has already stated in the anticipation of a termination. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "ALCOA said that the decision to expirate the agreements, the" "" "ability of Alcohol" "" "to maintain the melt or the supply of the melt" "" "not compromise." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that there have been a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have come into force in 2010, even if it is still a declaration, why it has been signed by the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analyst warns due to the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland will consume about 600 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts.</seg>
<seg id="23">If both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the [current market].</seg>

<seg id="11">20 years ago the Communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone maker had previously announced the product for a couple of months earlier on the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as "office in the western world format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for that time a lot: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax was the communicator to reach.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers, although slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably habitable for the projections of a new NASA climate change.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to detect the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble from climates.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have recorded similar conditions with their hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously thought that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin, inherent atmosphere and still twisted slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet argued probably more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to lodge life and protected from quick evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS-model simulation, the slow rotation of the Venus will expire their daily side of the sun for nearly two months," "" "said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which seems like a umbrella, to shielding the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures, which are a few degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a story of Venus that resembles the evolution previously thought by planet researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably habitable, the Venus was repeatedly exposed to a lot of heat and ultraviolet light during the years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and its water vapor was taken away from ultraviolet light.</seg>

<seg id="11">Only private use was the goal of a change to company attacks in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it is seeking a long changed files like Word, Excel- or database files as well as to archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files are encrypted and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software will then be presented by the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final key code to the files, the victims must get money - mostly in the form of tobiting Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But with private use the personal photo database is based on the game, companies are related to sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, damage is cancelled if a ransomware beats.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected companies reported revenue losses through Ransomware, 13 percent even had to stop the business activity, in case of a case people were mortal.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany several hospitals already were victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened with the loss of acute infections.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: pay not, it only encourages the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, their data will be back.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is difficult for managers to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the operation of standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure have been researched and tested the contact with the blackheads and come to the result: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service to obtain more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You explain your victims by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, direct access websites, or decrypt free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And individuals will be saved by few hundred Euros to payments, companies have to deal with hard and five-digit sums to returnaround their data.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers are always professional and share the work, explains security experts Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more likely, however, that it is three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware software in the form of a software construction kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The former malware kits were created by the malware yourself, advice and additional tools purchased for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is an adjustment system so that smaller configuration, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then look for other hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So, in one of the forums on the underground, the set is buying from a criminal and instructs the set to install the software on possible PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per certified machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals carry spammer with the spread," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ransomware's risk is now known by many companies that secure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the companies in the Malwarebytes polls trust that Ransomware to be able to defend Ransomware by File-Back-ups and Scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data is no sufficient threat to success is more, the perpetrators, instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This means the damage potential will be more often higher than before the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators may also take entirely new goals in the internet of the items of the grain.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the HackerConference Defcon, safety forgers demonstrated how they could get connected thermostat with the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the release of such a blocked heating could certainly be a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block the entire production road in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a theme in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V seems rather small, passengers have a lot of place in the first row and in the second row, there is no place in either place.</seg>

<seg id="10">The boot space can be loaded well, however, the loading height with 650 mm is higher than with a comparable Peugeot in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6-liter diesel engines with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one hurts forever. at night, one hour is awake at night, in the morning you can't think about sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, people with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, has approximately one quarter of adult insomnia and more than ten percent emptied their sleep frequently or permanently than not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there are various causes based on them, stresses Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for Sleep and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">Whatever you understand, the insomnia is, therefore, a single entry and a passage.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just that sleeping well you find many people as unsatisfactory or insufficient, Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board member in the German Houses Association in Varel, says.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">They can use organic, psychological or behavioral factors, but also medication.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the sleeping disorder expression of another illness.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is frequent, especially in depression," "" "says Weeß." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors would need each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Whoever has a herniated disc can be bad, is waking up every two to three hours and get to ponderous, over all day problems and worry, give an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I sleep with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">For who does not sleep well over a month in at least three nights a week, should be affected by the day, he should go to a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is disrupted, tired, undisturbed, has difficulty with attention and concentration, has trouble fluctuations or physical complaints such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep problems, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options, among other things, cognitive behavioral therapy or medication - classic killets only occur in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Research Center at the Charité University Medicine Berlin, is barely keeping there in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, if sleeping troubleshooting is necessary, you should consult a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="24">Who can clarify with studies, whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should be in a sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examinations in a sleep laboratory, medicine, for example, in snoring with respiratory diseases, occurs at bedbugs or if you don't find the cause of a passage, Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">Actually, one does not have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only do not make any lunch spot," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After sales you go to bed in its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one hand sunglasses carries a chest strap and a feeder on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera will draw the sleeping on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get in touch with the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of slot machines where you can get for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß counts on: regular sleep and upstop, not to sleep long in bed, do not sleep on the day, avoid drinking alcohol and avoid at night not at the clock - then you start immediately and that's all at all.</seg>

<seg id="8">After on June 22 the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been evacuated with 300 police officers, cancelled the police for three weeks, unlocked parts of the street and took visitors to the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime, building staff renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administration court decided that the clearing was illegal, and one day later police officers and workers under the lever of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">This afternoon, the road becomes peaceful: parents go for walking with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertained in front late Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the building projects a primary school and kindergartens lie.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who were here three children, are mainly generated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the skin research they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, who wished himself a majority of police in a vandalous left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench that the Berliner Domsenator and the police make up between house owners and their neighbors, obviously not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was a traditional workhorse, which also compared to the rest of the city a low average salary, and has a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also house networks and the native living projects have long been held to the pine forest: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied by the former GDR, including nearly the whole Mainzer road close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">As the maintainer had been evacuated in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and still occupied by people who had occupied them at 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become increasingly important to the magnets for tourists and selections from all over the world: living with them from DDR-periods and former household covers with their pine trees.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable by the rental rates that have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: you can recognize them in the raised discs or freshly painted facades, which were subjected to dyes.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned as often together with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason for that not all neighbors who consider the issue could be, that it is not necessarily concerned by crime: crimes such as bodily harm are according to policemen almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest part of offences make experts accusations, tend to make newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in a building house for 17 years apart from the controversial 94, there may be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbors who would not have been this.</seg>

<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rigaer Street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That's why it was so important that local residents got their way back: from police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly the deadline shores take over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of inhabitants like Neugebauer, the road will continue to leave them away: due divestment of new buildings in former buildings that displace old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"of course, these are condominiums, which are not interesting for many, here are more people who are not so well-kept," she says.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee community</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in the matters of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition she is a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee community for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social educator supports the team of administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She looks as an contact partner for all players: refugees, working group health, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Customer of the Working Group indicates that the honourable more than thankful that Deuschle now is to have the fans of wool, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus some - less spottled than rather on the multitude of desired tasks, meant - meant that management wanted to leave the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an administrative expert with a talent for languages and people, coupled with a long-term experience in the field of social labour, an active member of Wollischsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administration work is not its central area, means Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mainly to organization, work with people on-site and behind the scenes and network correctness.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been present for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">She matures a 50 per cent position for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," said Regine Customer, that Annika Deuschle is an honorary citizen and full-party actors.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small issues, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are available in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been to find apartments for connecting flights which have been acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for connecting cables.</seg>
<seg id="19">They need to accommodate refugees in your own or hired living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for building, rent or renovation of these accommodations must take the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility is alternately from the rural centre and the job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his place.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed as very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">This is de facto the management of no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It has not been working until now, on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments must be considered as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspectives is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed home base, training places, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and excursions for refugees and migrants that have to be established or established.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more seats would be good," reports Regine client.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help home craftsmen, perform nonprofit work - and the motivated and very neat as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "it is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But this does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day owes a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a state experience.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it offers offers like sport, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also manage management and honourable.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees feel the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You need to explain the refugees, that it lasts and they can bridge over time, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who would like to develop the feeling that he could not help in Urbach could not work and be unprofitable, he will never be able to integrate herself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority were motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But the problem cases are honest, "people are honest," people with which nothing goes. "the work of deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this has been a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two after recent advances are afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer clearly," "" "what some naive may call it." "" "but if they were missing, they will not fail to exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="51">Such incidents are also subject of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They had the fear that the attacks they were able to bring them completely in demand.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">Thus, main and honorary citizens must show on site and in the region after activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always in the background so that soon a new impact of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer, the policy is shaken.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place them locally.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived there where we want to," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine Customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher often have been utilized to integrate the previous men rational.</seg>
<seg id="63">At present, there are about 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need of adversity you must agree to them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no easy answers.</seg>
