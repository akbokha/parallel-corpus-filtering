Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very am@@ ic@@ able .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Teh@@ eran &apos;s dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
in the encounter , it should also deal with the conflict with the Palest@@ inians and the discussed two @-@ states solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been stra@@ ined for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement of Israel and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will to the peace process .
through the deal of the deal around the Iranian nuclear programme the relationship of the two continues to wor@@ sen@@ ing .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu announced an controversial speech to the Congress of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , a controversial speech against Obama .
the speech was not talking with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with a hint towards the right choice in Israel .
in a call he is professor to have shot his girlfriend .
in a emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told with a somewhat aw@@ ful voice of the police , that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers have to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb was important to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the cell phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house the officials found the bodies of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a hand@@ written note that fell on a white block , I could do it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this stood according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who had jour@@ ne@@ yed in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississi@@ ppi , discovered already 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was killed and killed by the police a popular professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff members have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 am .
he said that Lamb has made a cat@@ astroph@@ ic emergency .
till the end of the day he gave another death : he took the life , when the c@@ ops were en@@ cir@@ cled .
one day after shooting in the university , students and lec@@ tur@@ ers for@@ cing them to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to get a picture of them , which Lamb motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the details concerning the medi@@ ator on the two ends of the state were details , such as the students and employees who knew him , helped us to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly a difficult teacher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
students said they were happy to mar@@ ry in his classroom .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ ent@@ iss died , he did not have history of violence or a criminal incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in whom he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his common life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both educated in the department of social sciences and history , whose teaching bodies comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses from both .
at the same time , there were some inclin@@ ations to proble@@ matic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ aver@@ s , who praised him , said he also seemed a bit excited and nervous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if anything was wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb has asked the Delta State University for an event of health reasons , saying that he has any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the university would mean that the Promotion , for the Lamb , had been working hard for him , would not constitute a guarantee of an automatic way as Assistant Professor .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can &apos;t answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , the police finally found lam@@ bs track when he returned in Mississi@@ ppi in Ark@@ ansas .
before he could be arrested , killed self with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson said .
his car ran in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009 , with 3,@@ 500 students in a city with around 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he obtained his doctorate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the many years of friends Lam@@ bs called him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and He was 20 when they met through joint friends .
they and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool old guy who tried to teach the guitar playing for some years .
he was then the black and white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls are mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Bran@@ don . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no document from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the baking house , which mu@@ te at a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
Oh &apos; Ste@@ en said that Lamb was never met , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met P@@ ent@@ iss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came up after three years ago in a summer fair .
they later played together the one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a nurse , who worked for different companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes Entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak illuminated bar at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , said that he finished ro and Pr@@ ent@@ iss Night in night 5 September when Lamb finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica handle before a sp@@ aw@@ ful audience .
there was no sign of that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were riding on the lifts and jo@@ king together .
I mean they had both a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first @-@ semester seminar program and specialised on American native people and colonial history , Don &apos;t Miss Mitchell , an English @-@ professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and has been President of the Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people took part in the Delta State Campus in Cleveland , including downs , staff , students , and members of the commune .
Sch@@ mid@@ wife &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the guard at the &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace . &quot;
classes are resumed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississi@@ ppi .
Associated Press Auth@@ ors Emily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police reported that Lamb shot the emergency call after he shot Schmidt and that he described Schmidt in his emergency , but there is no indication that the two were ever married .

Michael J. Fox tells about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater dedicated to the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is empty next to me , and it will gradually see that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to me in mind that I am a sim@@ ulated g@@ aw@@ ning and a scar@@ let length of it , with the Princess of Wales at a date .

UN Chief says , There is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary General B@@ an Ki @-@ moon says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is no military solution for Syria &apos;s reinforced military support : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution for nearly five years of conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UN leader once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to join a united and integr@@ ative action to find a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the foreign minister of five permanent member states of the Council - USA , Russia , China , UK and France - on the outskirts of the General Meeting of the General Assembly in order to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the Regional powers will make this situation dis@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an called for the five standing members to show the same solidarity and unity in addressing a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 env@@ elop@@ es that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have attempted to brand him as a flop .
others have rep@@ ented him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to drag Donald Tr@@ ump from the top R@@ wis@@ s at surveys , it doesn &apos;t work .
ten of the last eleven national pol@@ ls showed Donald Tr@@ ump in double digits , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means to nomin@@ ate the nom@@ ination of the real estate .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the rep@@ ubli@@ can nomin@@ ee .
experts emphas@@ ise that at this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was made a tour at the rising tide of Herman Cain , which was not one of them who won only one state in the nom@@ er process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ sider groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ h@@ s Super PAC and the conservative Economic Party Club for Growth now recogni@@ zes their m@@ umps and begin to rush into their dollar to overthrow him .
here are some actual survey values , suggest@@ ing that the real estate is not just a temporary stage :
Tr@@ ump popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump acquired his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University revealed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate business positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten pre@@ dict that they have a negative opinion .
and those numbers keep themselves in the early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has discovered last week that 60 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters will be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CNN pol@@ l / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they were either &quot; enthusi@@ ast@@ ically &quot; or &quot; sati@@ es@@ fied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of them say , they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Ben Car@@ son delivers about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 % , they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enthusi@@ ast@@ ically &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent of the same thing about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of rep@@ ubli@@ can voters say that they were &quot; uns@@ at@@ is@@ fied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans is a pu@@ ff temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely acc@@ laimed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive @-@ breaking testimony , 52 percent of the Irish voters think that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered in the first voting state of the nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has succeeded in Commander for a commander , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
however , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to execute effectively and nearly six out of 10 ounces , his temper@@ ament does not fit in the White House , as ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters can get used to the idea .
if they sit down their schol@@ ar , rep@@ ubli@@ can voters keep up for real .
if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , a survey of CNN / OR@@ C say four of the last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change from time when four from ten end of July put their money to Je@@ b Bush .
disclos@@ ure : GO@@ P @-@ voters had not the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
to this date in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans were announced that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination at only 28 % for the final candidates of Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it reveals that a large number of GO@@ P @-@ voters want to see a plau@@ sible campaign .
even when the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans collected another candidate , Tr@@ ump hits almost everyone .
some experts point out that the spl@@ inter@@ ed field is likely to lead to tr@@ umps , while anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed over by more than a dozen of other candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head between Tr@@ ump and most other rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ tains the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead Walker 15 points , ahead of Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally ahead of margin Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes it ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head .
a vast majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says that they have formed their mind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters will support Tr@@ ump , saying that they have forgiven their voices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , much has happened to change this , and nobody can really say , never change the opinion .
46 percent said they had to leave the door openly to change to other candidates .
yet Tr@@ umps is the most powerful competition at the moment the other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters say that they have formed their opinion , are twice as often for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that with Tr@@ ump to co@@ inci@@ de with the theme of immig@@ ration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since then , Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign two months ago named immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ra@@ pe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; was the immig@@ ration of turning point and fishing point in the public dis@@ course of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic over@@ print of Tr@@ ump is crucial H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re @-@ orient@@ ating efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but according to the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they should co@@ inci@@ de with issues of immig@@ ration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as long as the immig@@ ration remained hidden in the spotlight , it seems that Donald Tr@@ ump appears to do it .
frustr@@ ation on the government climb@@ s to new high@@ lighting .
by now , on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of rep@@ ubli@@ can voters , above all through their out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mont@@ t survey by ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than anyone with a government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of Des Mo@@ ines regist@@ ers / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa finds three weeks ago that three of four I@@ owa @-@ rep@@ ublic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated about rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the congress , with 54 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ happy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and 21 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts of Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg , is the most expensive con@@ domin@@ ate park - with views over the North Sea watts .
in the street there is a square meter floor space on average 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euro .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; i.e. in the study - thus the high price .
a new study shows in which particular layers will cost a square meter of most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student book in Munich are not really little .
unlike Germany &apos;s top locations , however , one of the price seems like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers published a ranking of exclusive German locations - with square prices in di@@ zz@@ ling high@@ s .
there are several ten thousand euros nothing - per square meter , thou@@ ght@@ ful .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ Dream start thanks to Müller and Gö@@ tz@@ e
two tab@@ s in Pi@@ re@@ aus in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy showing by Thomas Müller paved the way to FC Bayern 3 : 0 at the Olympic champion Pi@@ re@@ aus - then ran .
a so@@ vereign in the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e decided to have a dream start into the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the he@@ aps of Piraeus .
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off play in the Champions League with the Greek record champion in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9. ) and 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th starting point in series will be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to pick the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller received the occasion of his 28 hits in the Champions League of the Bavarian leadership of the Olympic Champion of the Olympic champion , Roberto , who left one of the f@@ lange spher@@ es out of the world champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m warned of the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hot@@ ly fans promised - and the Munich held word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a focused and committed performance without having to shine .
Pi@@ re@@ aus won his youngest six home games in the p@@ inn@@ acle , including the well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid and Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
here , in 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also stum@@ bled here .
but the Bavaria , however , were defeated in seven European ac@@ ups with Greek teams , did not want the next victims .
they were brave , but with their obvious efforts , but often to think of works .
the attacks were introduced into the left on Lin@@ ks@@ op Douglas Costa that was rarely en@@ cir@@ cled by his former Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller acted from the right more luck than his flan@@ k caught in the right half of the gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski &apos;s best occasions in half of one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first , when the Olympic champion of Ide@@ a Brown proposed the head of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then , by direct withdrawal , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with the knee was par@@ ked ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although the Bavaria showed her unusual game , Pir@@ aus could put con@@ if@@ ers .
but on por@@ ters Manuel Neuer was missing .
just as he drew up a shot of ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te cou@@ plings ( 5@@ 6th ) .
new Gu@@ ardi@@ ola created a quarter with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e , after mus@@ cular problems back to the header , sat first outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WC @-@ hero had given the green light after the final training , said Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants something else to make this is mal@@ icious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the infected Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Gö@@ tz@@ e was late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later everything clear , by El@@ f@@ m , Müller was still going on .
before the game , it was fin@@ alized in the stadium to Kra@@ w@@ allen .
after a smaller group of avoided Bavaria fans in their audience block apparently prov@@ oked the followers of hosts Pi@@ re@@ us with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces seized and went out against the Munich followers .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was also transported out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth
the one smo@@ kes , not only damage the lungs , but also the teeth - this makes a Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study .
the good news : in case of w@@ ren@@ unci@@ ation , the risk is rapidly decreasing .
smokers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this is one of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees at the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers was the risk of losing their teeth early , in order to make the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 times higher .
the scientists had watched over 2@@ 3,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of dental cr@@ us@@ ages are c@@ aries and infections of gum , emphas@@ izes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is smoking is risk factor , emphas@@ ize the authors .
the relation between smoking and loss of teeth go back to frequent fl@@ esh@@ g@@ ums in smokers .
it is not clear that smoking is also increasing the risk of c@@ aries .
people who stopped at smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , the researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the threat of dangerous again told the level of non @-@ smokers , first aut@@ or Thomas Dietrich von der Manchester University , Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they must convince people of it , not to be smo@@ ker , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Head of H@@ einer Boeing from Dij@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; qu@@ itting smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and vessels and leads to our recognition also to good dental health to high age .
by Germany , more than 20 percent of the population is affected by the population aged 65 to 74 , divided by DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early dental out@@ ages .
the new long @-@ term study supports the fun@@ eral .

EU Commission proposes a new court to fight on TTIP
the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system to prevent the greater trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement in TTIP .
accordingly , the controversial private floo@@ ding facilities for disputes between the companies and states are to be replaced by a transparent system , which corresponds to much more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make up a system that trust the citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the EU @-@ commission@@ er Cecilia Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ de has before introducing the proposal as European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the USA .
the German Government announced support .
TTIP will be the largest free trade zone around the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration procedures fore@@ see that EU countries and the US choose jointly independent judges for a new investment camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
the second instance is also provided for the first time .
she would allow it to up@@ lift an appeal against judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far the parties concerned themselves with one arbit@@ rator , a way to claim against their judgments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice to Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it intends to go to an international investment court .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clari@@ fied .
the Investor Relations Process ( IS@@ DS ) , mainly requested by major companies , are regarded as one of the major reasons for major resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration are critic@@ ized by enemies as a combination of parall@@ el@@ ism , via the company compensation rules , national laws , or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the first opinions , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act received the European Commission &apos;s proposals as in@@ adequate .
above all , it is not intended to apply for the already traded free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic state Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) marked the plans for further progress .
the commission had essential points to reform the Federal Minister of Energy Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private refer@@ ral coat was from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against re@@ tren@@ ching the claim of business by too many new rules .
particularly small and medium businesses could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , named it .
when the talks are negoti@@ ated on the TTIP free trade agreement TTIP ( Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) , it remained un@@ clear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investment protection has not yet been discussed with the USA .
originally a framework for the agreement should already be completed by the end of this year .
this date is considered to be no longer sustainable .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens on stage in Cologne , Prime Club ( today : Luxor ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the in@@ timi@@ dated Fol@@ ks@@ änger was recorded in the picturesque US state of Mich@@ igan with felt @-@ tip pen .
the entire audience , about 40 persons , is nearly caught by Stev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells of different places that he always notes on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they were created , and as it looks , in his homeland .
since then Stev@@ ens proves itself as mirac@@ ulous creative Ireland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the 2003 published and third album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appear smart composed songs that can taste harmonious very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but they can drift off at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rum@@ our , &quot; Mich@@ igan , &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 states of US states should be as a result .
but already 2004 and near the proximity , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; already appeared and had a good expectations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , Stev@@ ens then served on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) extensively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sixth Ord@@ inary studio album is more and more orchest@@ rated , but played by programmed sequences or beats , plays with all the effect and rever@@ b .
long ago , the smaller clubs has emerged as the stage shows here for the colorful range of Neon @-@ brow@@ bands and grand fluorescent stage de@@ ko .

although nearly 2,000 guests have been running into their chairs here , the clearly irrit@@ ated Stev@@ ens return to in@@ tim@@ acy and folk .
without setting up the audience , the group plays an excellent album by the highly recommended album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; op@@ ul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can now throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ke debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questions .
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ l made his debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister on tension .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should give his debut at the prime minister of the Prime Minister for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will set up in order to ask for the first of his six prescribed questions shortly after noon , whereby his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour M@@ EPs from close @-@ hand .
he called for &quot; less theater and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said he wanted to skip some sessions to leave them to their colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary trial for Mr Cor@@ by@@ l &apos;s leadership , for she comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow of shadow and his speech at the Tu@@ c Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader announced on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them in silence to the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS and stands at the center of several title pages of stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ l &apos;s decision to sing the national an@@ them has drawn attention to itself
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n , he had stood in respec@@ t@@ ful silence , &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ um of Royal Air Force at the Battle of England . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ke Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he had advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nearly a dozen of the Dark Minist@@ ries had refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ l &apos;s top team , and they are called to dis@@ agreements on economic , defence and foreign policy , while less than a six @-@ sixth party of the Parliamentary party supported him as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political correspon@@ dent on the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences also follow within the labour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stack@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Mr Cor@@ by@@ l &apos;s remarks to the European Union and the limit in winn@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the Tu@@ c conference that Labour changes fore@@ ward to remove the whole idea of a del@@ im@@ itation overall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow of labour and pen@@ sions said that the party &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they were only against the government plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , leader David Cameron , since he has headed T@@ ory CEO in the last decade over the Disp@@ atch @-@ Box in parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader who has promised an other Politi@@ ken , says that he has given &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Fra@@ gest@@ ion of the Prime Minister is confron@@ ted , and that he will supp@@ ress both &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perc@@ ep@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and spreading to serious problems like poverty , ine@@ quality , and challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic ministers will represent him when he is not taking part - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling overseas .
he also brought the idea that other colleagues occasionally show the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the House , addressed to discuss the problem .
when he was leading the leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he is interested in politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ Theatre , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister of the Prime Minister . but some years later he acknowledged that he failed .
as it was first sent in 1990 on TV , the quest@@ ionnaire was considered the most important Bar@@ ometer of the decision of a leader and his position in the lower house and of its position among its parliamentary report , although critics have argu@@ ed to have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require extensive reforms .

pound climb@@ s up through accelerated increase in the United Kingdom
the pound weight increased precip@@ it@@ ously according to data that represents an increase in wage growth in the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was raised by the goal of SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July the result was increased by 2.9 % in the UK by 2.9 % compared to the same period last year .
this percentage had been the fastest and recognised assessment of the time of interest in 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % from the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after acquire the acquisition of the ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ z@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were based on aging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures suggest all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - was mel@@ ted again .
the shares of G@@ LEN@@ COR@@ E climbed 5 % , after the mining giant said $ 2.5 billion due to a share sale as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the packaging of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the largest publisher in the index , namely , with a drop of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set its assessment for the company Rating on their own .
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % , after the sport @-@ cl@@ adding company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.6 million .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that Higher W@@ ages are at risk of expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher wage for UK workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of the potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compens@@ ate the higher cost of labor at his company , he says .
the costs could make the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean less additional jobs .
Just@@ in Bie@@ ber in the Capital : on the Bie@@ ber Expedition in Berlin
Just@@ in Bie@@ ber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar .
les@@ bian 21 years young , a hand@@ fl@@ ing with top quality FR@@ ISE .
the type with platinum flowers hair is 100 million Euros heavy .
rather even more .
at present , Mon@@ sie@@ ur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 turns by .
like Vik@@ toria Rud@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; never heard .
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Just@@ in yesterday .
including E@@ wa and Victoria from Poland .
however , since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , the upholster@@ y sits at the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the Bie@@ ber Building : here you live I@@ dol who posters hung up in St@@ ett@@ in , since Monday evening .
the suite , where the Canadian singer lives , is exactly as much as her mom E@@ wa is ear@@ ns about half a year .
if at all .
that says : &quot; actually my Vik@@ toria had to sit in the tenth grade in the high school . &quot;
&quot; I fill her a dream . &quot;
to school with school light ?
who are gre@@ ed ?
the fans do not .
also Bie@@ ber itself did not .
he taught it anyway .
for the advertisement in the advertising tru@@ ce of the super@@ l@@ ad he cas@@ hed three million , one double @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ples company , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber account .
and when every doll looks like he looks and goes over the counter , bent also .
when Just@@ in Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , you get amazed at the window disk .
more than 100 million people should have been so explo@@ ited .
some say the h@@ ype came too far away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other bedding , bent is finally in the USA and the UK with his new single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you Me@@ an ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; number 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album should follow in November , the many N@@ ul@@ ls are not curious .
at least he does so .
P@@ EG@@ IDA poster brings Leban@@ ese in the potato @-@ woofer idea
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
both of them are in the potato twe@@ eter , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ al owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay has developed .
inspired by the &quot; potato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a poster the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ h@@ ay potato has put together on a ske@@ wer .
the idea put him a poster at a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he had seen acci@@ dentally on TV .
since then , a grill ske@@ wer that is equipped with meat and potatoes in his shop .
&quot; this is multic@@ ul@@ tur@@ i for the stomach , &quot; said Al@@ h@@ ay .
the idea has meanwhile registered the Leban@@ ese medicine in Munich .
there , according to the authority , it has recently been protected as utility patent .
how much meat and how much potatoes contains the ske@@ wer , Al@@ h@@ ay wants to betra@@ y it .
only so much : &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; he finds .
also with its customers , the culinary understanding come well .
Met@@ cash begins ground @-@ in@@ dig@@ in@@ gement campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - inhal@@ ation
met@@ a tries to protect the IG@@ A branches in front of an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers Met@@ in has launched a bottom @-@ in@@ dig@@ y campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di is preparing the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ ers and IG@@ A @-@ supermarkets enhance their relationships with local food suppliers and marketing the brand IG@@ A through ma@@ inst@@ ream marketing and marketing concerning social media , as well as Adelaide @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as ice@@ manufacturer Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , distributed in IG@@ A @-@ stores , and shop@@ keepers , who sell tickets to the South Australian Football League to faithful clients .
it is expected that Met@@ ers release further details of its defence strategy on September 29 when the wholesale for food , alcohol and equipment takes off his annual investment strategy .
it stands a lot on the game since South Australia and Western Australia generate almost 30 percent of met@@ cas@@ h@@ s IG@@ A @-@ stores and generate higher profit margin as a met@@ cas@@ h@@ s IG@@ A network in eastern states .
purchases in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much more powerful market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern Australia .
however , anal@@ ysts such as Morgan Stanley said that Al@@ di twelve months after opening his first markets will s@@ nap around five percent of the food market in these two countries and will take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stanley said that IG@@ A @-@ retailers could lose 360 $ million in turnover each year and a total of $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in the next year , generating a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
the loss in food and food market and at the quantities on Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s high fixed cost could cost some 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ ers loses market shares in eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan that IG@@ A @-@ buyers are the loyal .
Morgan Stanley is expecting sales by 3.8 percent in the Food and Food market , in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and the market share is reduced from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leadership of the Fon@@ ds@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , with a business dinner in Melbourne , expected to be known to disappear within a decade .
Met@@ in refused to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member has made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ A market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s Food and food trade , which has been reduced by 43 percent since 2012 , reflec@@ ting the operative debt reduction in terms of pressure and mar@@ gins .
however , the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers f@@ ends and invests more than 150 million $ in order to improve sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ ei@@ ths for hundreds of products each week by growing rapidly growing fresh foods and to deliver a better variety of private label products .
Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop sanit@@ ising programs on Elan will grow and hopes that the wholesale retail@@ er will return to profit in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve Heal@@ y
Than@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and des@@ erved to see the President of the Australian tennis association Steve Heal@@ y rather praise as criticism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always referred to as the &quot; Special C@@ KS &quot; by the not@@ orious discussion of Cy@@ ril with St@@ an WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA in the Montreal Masters .
in a fier@@ y qualification game in Cincinn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison called Harrison called &quot; WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA &quot; would have to beat her , and I should sm@@ ite the child . &quot;
while he was last seen , even as he struck a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp negoti@@ ated a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is was bred by Heal@@ y .
the teen@@ ager is present in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth on the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup final against the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a thing about which I have res@@ cu@@ ed myself is the fact that after my view Than@@ asi was brought in a little into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken an bat when he lost a b@@ ump in the US Open , but he is not the first player to break a bat of frustr@@ ation with himself , and I know Than@@ asi enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around , and I think he was treated a bit too strictly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he &apos;s working in the team and so on , he is working hard , he is well trained in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged on his own mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heal@@ y also supported the decision that Cy@@ r@@ gios is beginning to take into account the important decision , and he describes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as long lasting fix@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Cy@@ ril &#93; , &quot; said Heal@@ y .
and I believe that Nick made a very fast trip to the attention of what people like Feder@@ er and Murray would have gone and deserves all the criticism that he gets , but in which he can only think about it , and it is best for the team and it is best for the team and it is best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains Not@@ with@@ standing , closes the border , with@@ holds refugees back
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary had agreed the emergency and locked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the elections to come illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
chaos followed the border as hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and responded to Serbian officials with Out@@ rage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people fled before violence , for an unknown time on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but frustr@@ ations rose to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police force fails to protest against them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried ins@@ ults against Hungarian polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some happened to protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ser@@ bi@@ ens Foreign Minister declared it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that immigrants came back from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ ater@@ alism .
in the upcoming days , discussions with Brussels and other countries have to be held , &quot; said Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian Serb border ended a day after the 28 @-@ Nations blo@@ c on a turbul@@ ent meeting in Brussels could not agree on joint immig@@ ration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who have refuge for 40,000 people , and they expressed their hope that in the next month , or until the end of the year , an agreement would say that the EU countries would receive further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
on Tuesday , Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit in the European Union to discuss the inv@@ it@@ ations of the continent .
Hungary , however , did not put his hopes on a re@@ pris@@ matic action of Brussels or its neigh@@ bors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Not@@ with@@ standing announced on Tuesday opened in two southern regions there were more powers to cope with the crisis so they might block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire to Romania in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants across the country - after killing a fence along the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even terms of prison were used at the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
during the past few months Hungary has become a substantial involvement in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East into a substantial involvement and the gateway to the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has , however , asser@@ ted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are in search of a better life and do not have war refugees - a view that strongly oppos@@ es to other EU states , among them Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make crossing the border or damage the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ us who had to build the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also set higher arrest pun@@ ishments for convicted traff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation that emerged through the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ olt@@ an Kov@@ acs rep@@ or@@ ers in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament must still agree to the military service which is expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associated Press have already seen fri@@ day armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities have 45 people attemp@@ ting to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country .

Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven cross @-@ fron@@ ts with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the boundaries .
chaos prev@@ ails the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and put a crowd in order to go down there .
it succeeded in killing 20 , but thousands remained outside .

vote @-@ 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey
the former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is holding a two @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race to nomin@@ ate the nom@@ ination at national level but sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins it to the bottom .
Clinton now has the support of 47 % of democratic voters in the previous election ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not announced yet , whether he bom@@ bed the presidency of the presidency , receives support of 15 per cent of the democratic voters of the elections .
more than five months before the start of the pre @-@ elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion stands what candidates would support them .
but Clin@@ tons supp@@ orter are more resistant than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton had lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders had generated some profits .
Clinton is a huge advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but the jumps have decreased .
your support for the men is down clearly , and S@@ anders is only with 5 points behind .
Clin@@ tons advantage for democratic voters over 50 years has disappeared , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
but Clinton had a big lead in the older voters .
in the past month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit advantage in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders had a 5 @-@ point advantage over this group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the democratic voters say that they would support with enthusiasm when they were nominated by the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a quarter would support it with some preliminary measures and further 15 percent would only support it because the candidate is can@@ did@@ acy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are especially excited about it .
the views are mixed with the ones that are not currently supported in the Clinton - just about a quarter would support it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while 48 % of the democratic voters say that it would support the Clinton with enthusiasm , say less rep@@ ubli@@ can voters say this about their nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 % ) &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Clin@@ tons supp@@ orter asked that she is the candidate , is the most common answer that she is the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by a woman &apos;s President ( 13 % ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons supports its connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
the agreement with the problems and the voters are also quoted .
since the Vice @-@ President re@@ jects a potential for the presidential office , 57 % of the democratic voters want to see him in the race despite a third believed that he should not do it .
if democratic voters want to be asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
from Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice in a different way .
if Bi@@ den decides to spell out the nom@@ ination of the demo@@ c@@ rats , Hillary Clinton thus increase his lead against S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in race .
twenty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a can@@ did@@ acy with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has declined by 78 per cent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second at this measurement , but the percentage that looks like &quot; selectable &quot; has now risen .
nevertheless , with the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the voters .
similar to the last month , no single cr@@ ati@@ c@@ rat@@ a candidate or potential candidate for these voters ti@@ fi@@ eth un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics of the party elections in their party .
we consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trusted and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den cuts out best candidates at the top three candidates , while Clin@@ tons is the lead .
thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say that above S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion about him .
Democratic voters of the S@@ elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , around one quarter of democratic voters no opinion of S@@ anders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as questions concerning Hillary Clinton &apos;s personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as Minister of Foreign Affairs are still satisfied with their declaration of matter and say that their opinions will not influence their opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s a different story in the American public .
half of Americans are un@@ happy with their declaration , while only about one third is satisfied .
the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most of the Americans said that the e @-@ mail @-@ contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on the general opinions of Clinton , although 36 % said that their opinion of her have even wor@@ sen@@ ed .
it is mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 that have become worse by Clinton .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trusted by the voters of their party , it is still a problem for them under registered voters . only 32 percent see it as honest and trusted , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the nation@@ alists see also Tr@@ ump as in@@ honest and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good notes at the lead .
of the six tested candidates Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best cut in hon@@ esty .
a majority is quite different from being honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinions of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves in a sales survey close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is located close to Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times
in the meantime , half of the support of voters in the new pol@@ l and others lost dramatically .
rep@@ ubli@@ can voters continue supporting Tr@@ ump in great numbers . the support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey carried out before Fox News debate over the past month by 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son decreased from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also showed that Car@@ son is well @-@ addressed in demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ pass Tr@@ ump under rep@@ ubli@@ can voters .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Kas@@ ich , is kno@@ cked off with Wis@@ con@@ sins , Governor Scott Walker , who fell in deepest order , namely 10 % of the previous month &apos;s support to now 2 % .
former Florida Governor Je@@ b Bush , former Governor of Ark@@ ansas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place .
the error mar@@ row at the sample sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week shows that Car@@ son ends in the pol@@ ls - he lan@@ det with 19 % support in the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post was also clearly showing Tr@@ ump .
with a look at one in the last week , Tr@@ ump discovered some side houses for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask their t@@ umps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nice swimming @-@ temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even when the peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough to present warm water .
a maximum of 17 degrees should be a rather short pleasure in the North or Baltic Sea .
some of them are no more into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week divi@@ des the German weather service ( D@@ WD ) .
on the other side , swimming @-@ temperatures also offers the Mediterranean : even in the east it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic Sea , there are 25 degrees in France , 23 degrees in France .

five members of the Brotherhood , with the death of a Bar@@ uch college course
for almost two years after a student has filed a student union at Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , a student connection against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College Pi @-@ P@@ si @-@ P@@ si @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ ges attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduction of the ritual and was delayed by his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police shared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; officers said that he was charged with blind@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound backpack @-@ filled of sand , and repeatedly attacked , while he was trying to go over a frozen field on a target . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Den@@ g finally struck over head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ therhood are not calling for the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g w@@ ain@@ ted and waited for an hour before they brought him to hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to contact D@@ eng@@ s clothes to contact his symptoms to goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national President of the Brotherhood , and police chef Chris Wagner , said on a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members of conc@@ ession began to hide and set the sake of the Brotherhood in principle about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police chef Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning to his injuries .
according to the aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g has repeatedly joined with mu@@ ff@@ ler power injury to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 each year to the ch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents a member of the D@@ eng@@ s family in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ h@@ oods and their members must be held to account and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge because of Mor@@ a &apos;s third count for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with criminal attacks and formation of a criminal corporation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to blame the individuals involved , but if there is an organization that has - officially or in@@ officially - we will also draw those to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner on a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their citizenship to the local group .
that will happen if the F@@ ed elev@@ ates interest
an interest rate comes , and the house@@ work will be caught , return for bonds , and the economy will slip into recession .
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , history for the economy offers only low guide to the process .
a recession came in only 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ sion of the Federal Reserve upon raising the interest rates is often , if not always , one factor here , such as the economy and financial investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , representatives of the US @-@ Central Bank have st@@ alled as fier@@ c@@ ely stressed that investors should not concentrate on increasing interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , the contrac@@ tor could see , however , that all the excitement due to a rise would be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inev@@ it@@ ably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal heights , but still on a low level to fear the se@@ is@@ mic shock , to fear many .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a look at some historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as seen in the last month the market can take advantage of inser@@ ts things for a while .
once the increase hit , the influence isn &apos;t so dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency to be compens@@ ated for 12 to 24 months after the initial increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche @-@ Bank anal@@ ysts in a recent study , what had happened after del@@ eting the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market is usually in the upward trend - roughly 14 percent - on the way to a interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days after driving ( average profit of 2,6 % ) , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a current analysis , which Bob D@@ oll , Chef @-@ Strat@@ ogram at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks could later occur in the increase cycle , and the margin begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest cav@@ ities do they often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed faced some conditions that could not existed before and subsequent recession .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extremely notable is that the gross domestic product is in the vicinity of its lowest point at a stand @-@ up of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 Z@@ inser@@ ts were only twice the nominal GDP at 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only few are expected to last and expect to see Atlanta F@@ ed for the third quarter upwards , just 1.5 percent for the third quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest in a so frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop could be ris@@ ky , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; market participants have taken the whole year on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as many strateg@@ ist and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading is just a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all the increased cycles from 1950 to date took place in a super cycle with an increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ essi@@ on@@ sh@@ ö@@ hen is made very fast after the beginning of the recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a very slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has waited since the end of the last recession , the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months now .
the fixed income was also vol@@ at@@ ile , since the market increases a rise of interest , and the pattern is fairly similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than shares , if they change their strategic course .
in bonds , the returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first enhancement / lower@@ ing occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond tra@@ vers@@ aries arrive immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believes that the increase in interest rates will result in a closer and shorter desc@@ end@@ ment closer together and lead to a fl@@ etching of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields , although &quot; we are still c@@ auti@@ ous to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Anal@@ yst@@ in , in an analysis .
interesting is , Jones says that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed Strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation , there are some evidence that the market has adapted to the prosp@@ ect of more str@@ ingent monetary policy . &quot;
short @-@ term interest has increased , the yield curve is flat , bor@@ rows have expanded , and the v@@ at@@ ility has increased - all characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed shar@@ pen@@ ed its strategy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the large and whole , companies will un@@ wind the larger part of their business in the USA , benefit from interest rates and increase local products . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multin@@ ational companies with high debts will be worse than an increasing cost of their products in the global market and also the financing of their debt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares ten@@ ds to respond more positively to three months following an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s @-@ anal@@ ysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have achieved company with weak balance after each of these air@@ planes in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points on average .
companies with high capital yields and low vol@@ at@@ ility in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality at the average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will become a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose the most , Gold@@ man said .
consumers &quot; share also profit through the rising fuel outside the pure stock of shares .
savings could see winn@@ ings by higher yields , even if experts of different opinions will happen how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says MEP Andrew B@@ ingham
the Parliament , member of the Parliament , critic@@ izing the broad@@ c@@ aster for its &quot; over@@ sight &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is not to be distinguished by commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that she would only have The Br@@ its

BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts &apos; to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading parliamentary committee and increases new pressure on the sender to prove that he does not do what the private sender does not do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative de@@ pu@@ ties Andrew B@@ ingham said to the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public broad@@ casts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ev@@ apor@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is increasingly un@@ aware of its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I &apos;m using the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ev@@ apor@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , initiated in December .
the BBC Music Awards , starting last year , The Br@@ its seem to be just under another name .
so , if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples , where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC General Director directed the alle@@ g@@ ations back and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 lies ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to the public about live music and recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance .
what I &apos;m learning from Radio 3 I will learn about classical music somewhere else .
and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and music that truly is un@@ parall@@ eled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and give new works on behalf , I &apos;m also really important for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey that harder to work to engage the audience as it did in the past because the British informs less about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production , while the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport for it came under fire to tre@@ ad the commercial ri@@ vals .
T@@ ory MPs set Dam@@ ien Collins to The Voice to - the musical talent show at the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not very distinctive ?
Lord Hall was showing that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judges - &quot; on special BBC mode &quot; was produced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; got a hit from our own house stall , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it starts the next time a entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he ref@@ uses to exclu@@ de the order from further series of The Voice in the future , or to give money to other entertainment formats .
net sales grew in August at the slow@@ est and black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month there was the lowest score since the start of records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to buy
experts believe that the Black Friday placed the expenditure on Friday in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has been drilled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets become transformed in ghost cities .
but experts say that there are indications that the online sales stag@@ n@@ ated , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the start of records in 2000 , with just five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stag@@ n@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for the years before and to 2000 , that has always been developed over the course of time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sale trade in The Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he stated that the online sales increased by three years ago , as a purch@@ aser began to make purchases on their phone .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e. g. at home on the sofa .
but now , the one comm@@ utes and we might experience that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for high @-@ class sales .
experts believe that buyers will take their purchases before this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers in order to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealers are crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers were fought for bar@@ gains , buyers would stop the buyer from doing their purchases .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium invented that £ 5 copies has been issued a little over £ 1 online .
with some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , over one third of the shopping is now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of man &apos;s clothing and shoes are buying online instead of fashion chains in the cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca when crane accident killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are mut@@ ed by Muslims in the first bur@@ ial events in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia em@@ ulates the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that altogether 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed .
hundreds of Muslims met , when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets , to bury the victims , were killed as a crane on Mek@@ kas Big mo@@ sch@@ ee r@@ ushed .
they filled a sigh@@ ted , largely in white , the route to tender their respect , when the first of the dead entered their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ ur cemetery .
the fun@@ eral came over in the Holy Place where only a few days earlier , a building crane passed through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the bed .
the bodies were released for fun@@ eral when the Saudi King , over the construction company of the bin Laden &apos;s family bin Laden because of the disaster , killing 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction handed down .
the bodies of 29 advis@@ ers killed , when a crane over@@ threw the Great Central Bank of Mek@@ kas , was carried through the streets .
at the dead , Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ram , Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , was on his first pilgrimage that was thrown out on his first pilgrimage .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents at the start of the annual H@@ add@@ in in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already noted that the p@@ add@@ in will continue to Mec@@ ca by thousands that continue to come to town .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden group should not steal the arm of the crane , when he was not used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an Arabic version of the decree , which was published by the state of Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
this detail did not read this detail in the English news agency , but said that the leadership of the company abroad are forbidden .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man referred to reveal what the fall of the crane caused , who jum@@ ped in a courtyard of the large mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims appeared before the H@@ add@@ sch , who later gathered in this month .
the Bin Laden group did not have any statements about the collapse of the sick , and their representatives were not available for a statement .
the royal decree also imp@@ acted the group because of not current security measures and because they did not co@@ operated with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of cro@@ ws are located by Mek@@ ong Great mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project , which is led by the Bin Laden group .
the Bin Laden &apos;s family has been linked to the Saudi Arabia family for decades and is taking over large construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a young son who was un@@ suitable from the family in the 1990s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of each healthy away .
they said that 158 people remain in hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government officials said that 1 million R@@ ial ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to pay to relatives of the killed members and the same amount of permanently injured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other injured will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European craftsmen is over
Britain employs increasingly cra@@ ft@@ men , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe extended its rise
this leads to 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are opened to art@@ isans
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q Sales jobs will close across the country
from Rupert Steiner , City Head @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Britain carry out their hamm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of skilled workers &quot; craftsmen that perform working in their home
if you sk@@ ill@@ fully sk@@ ill@@ fully using a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you belong to a minority nowadays .
because Br@@ its are increasingly skilled workers to conduct home jobs in their homes so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her , who has the hom@@ ec@@ ary chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services to low@@ land prices have since been over@@ hau@@ led .
so King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops offering art@@ isans and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry told she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten buying decisions in the shop are hit by women .
at the moment they weigh men with men .
she said it was necessary to provide the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single households that carry out more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; It is still a majority of men in our branches .
we must move this more strongly to balance .
basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in the decision process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , also has its top team to reflect a same number of men and women in leadership positions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the teams involving women , including his management and CFO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a drop in the half @-@ year profit and ren@@ der@@ ment after the group shoul@@ dered the cost of closing the stores .

officials from A@@ I / DO@@ B because of un@@ faithful judgment
the Provincial Court of Kl@@ agen@@ furt took charge of two officials of the Austrian volleyball player A@@ I / DO@@ B for un@@ faithful and public opinion .
the def@@ endants pleaded not guilty .
one of them was also accused of counter @-@ cell abuse .
he has been legally acquitted of this alle@@ g@@ ation in May .
the present process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the def@@ endants were cryst@@ all@@ ised in the years 2006 to 2011 , that the def@@ endants were allowed to disp@@ ose involved in their functions for private purposes .
the damage amount to about 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sports officials are also charged with financial markets .
this fact was the chairman of the bill of paper , judge Michael Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
for respec@@ ting the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence suggested that the association was at no time a asset .
the sports officials could have been charged with subsi@@ dy charges and had invested a lot of time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money , which were brought down from the debts - the Pas@@ si@@ va was about 600@@ ,000 per cent ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euros ) .
&quot; back then , we stood in front of the situation : do we carry on or block the club ? , &quot; one of the def@@ endants , in the bread@@ th of great audit@@ or of the financial department .
with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money to pay our life insurance as a security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in redemption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the association has been agreed , you can manage the money free , no debts could be made .
in the case of appropriate financial success the withdrawal of the allowance of allowance was decided by 1991 .
that &apos;s why I had to pay a part of the allowance for years later , as a plus on the account has been paid out .
thus also Pau@@ l@@ - and not detailed devi@@ ations on , explained the former Ob@@ mann processes .
the accounts and the austerity books ruled the two accused , said the second accused .
why don &apos;t the withdraw@@ als have been explicitly disclos@@ ed to the association , judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association is not interested in the finance for finance , but it was only important to have debt relief , thus the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , as in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ .000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account against the organis@@ ational investigations .
these were resi@@ due , the def@@ endants were declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second accused and was not known according to the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
Wher@@ eu@@ p@@ on I knew no answer .
then he said eventually , he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something happened , nobody would have known anything about this money , the pro@@ secutor dropped into space .
the room@@ mate was informed , the functioning of the functions .
this wire has been formulated as &quot; In@@ dem@@ nity Insurance . &quot;
why do you want to know claims ? , judge and pro@@ secutor wanted to know .
Wher@@ eu@@ p@@ on , the first def@@ endant said that he had not been agreed with this formulation , because we never had any damage to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all from the tail@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
he said the functional , he never referred to a cent salary , he just counted mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
according to di@@ ets , he charged 1000 Euro per month , but the actual effort would have been much higher , but added .
the def@@ endants were not documented in exact documents for the early years .
these are after a working test , in which everything was judged correctly , no longer have been kept .
mil@@ eage money was also referred to as the second accused .
all surveys are carried out in cash , with this he had to leave from his habitat of international law to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the trial will continue with the survey of witnesses on 23 September .
Hewlett @-@ Packard stops additional 30,000 jobs
additionally , for three years , the HR stabili@@ zation will replace the Compu@@ terri@@ fic with the development of the company further jobs .
the job positions at the US Compu@@ Gold @-@ Packard ( HP ) have no end .
as part of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customers .
as a result , costs amounting to EUR 2.7 billion ( EUR 2.4 billion ) shall be saved , distributed by the company on Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special impact of about $ 2.7 billion , which will be incur@@ red from the fourth quarter .
the mining of 55@@ ,000 jobs have not been completed since three years .
HP occupied only around 30@@ 2,000 associates at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year .
Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Share was 2.3 percent .
currently , the comprising a large group from the California Palo Alto , California sp@@ ends itself on : thus the computer and print store is to be bund@@ led in a new company - separated from the advanced areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
another disappoin@@ ting PC section as well as a weaker demand of corporate customers following his services put the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturers on Lenovo recently .
in the third quarter of July , sales of PC and printers went down by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thereby the proceeds went back to 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds with a split and massive job positions on the change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only responded so late to buy customers from smartphones and tablets , instead of conventional computers , and are always ready to do business online .
a total of about 55@@ ,000 jobs will be seen in Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring .
conflicts : majority supported anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct participation of German soldiers in mar@@ tial areas in Iraq would lead mainly to ref@@ usal : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent were added .
there are 61 percent positive that other states of air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria .
in contrast , 24 percent are in conflict with the conflict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a collaboration with the Syrian leaders of Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad just 51 % of respon@@ dents would be 20 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29 percent were not able to decide .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : non @-@ violence to the Serbian border
Hungarian police joined the Serbian Border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ nar@@ as and Aquarius for several hundred million refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ ws @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ án@@ iel Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k had witnessed the violence depart@@ ing at the border tro@@ ll@@ ing point .
he reported phone :
a group of refugees interrupted the border .
behind it a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen got a water@@ light .
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones , stones , and plastic bottles after the officials .
the officials initially put an imper@@ tin@@ ent pepper spray .
after that the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
much Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as was spra@@ yed in the direction of refugees .
thus the group was resolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drew a little .
a pregnant and obviously injured woman was taken away from the zone .
children who have entered their lac@@ ri@@ ots , cried out .
other refugees assembled in themselves and suffered under respir@@ ation .
the Serbian police spokes@@ man also suffered from the use of lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ as and pepper spray by the use of p@@ ant@@ eng@@ as and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US emergency tank
the world is observed when the US Not@@ enb@@ ank is coming to two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision , whether for the first time has to be lifted by interest rates or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists that were survey@@ ed by Reuters , found that a bit more than half , the last week of view , thinks that F@@ ed will do a bit longer and will keep interest rates on the current stand of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it is seven years since the F@@ ed interest sat down to NULL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and one process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates will start , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , leading employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is at a relatively good level , tr@@ illion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude view of global circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warned the markets , susp@@ end on increasing , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8@@ pm CET on Thursday
path@@ ological support at the Delta State University post@@ pon@@ ed compensation
&quot; &quot; &quot; after killing and killing his friend in Mississi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later killed his colleagues and killed , he wrote &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted to do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said authorities on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer of geography and social sciences at the Delta State University , calling the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning .
and he said , He shot on someone and to kill some man .
Lamb said the staff of the Emer@@ gency Central Committee that the police send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the house unless they are distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb has no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry that I wanted to und@@ o it .
I loved Amy , and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note recorded roughly 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday night when polic@@ emen caught him .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite the reports on Monday , the Lamb believed that Pr@@ ent@@ iss had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is no evidence of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triangle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ ent@@ iss was told by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said they were married for about seven years , as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were forced 15 years ago , but friends remained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Oh &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ ent@@ iss had one daughter , who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he told that Pr@@ ent@@ iss was their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss worked online from home , according to the testimony of Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss .
Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss , who had a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; said Kno@@ w@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb requested a certain time on Monday to say to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he didn &apos;t go into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville in that night , Lamb crossed his car to the side , fled to the forest and killed himself in a shot .
Lamb received a PhD student from the Delta State University in the spring of 2015 , as his esp@@ ion@@ es on the University &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
Lufthansa is planning a large group of group .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save a half billion euros in the year alone with a better organization .
150 of the world &apos;s approximately 1000 senior exec@@ u@@ tives will cost the workplace in group sales .
there are numerous new negotiations with the pilot project .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the tr@@ illion Euro@@ wings .
the company &apos;s objective is to result in a profit contribution of some 500 million euros a year from cost and income , the airline divided the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no management board for the passenger business in the future .
the head@@ line Euro@@ wings should be developed as independently as possible .
Karl Ulrich Corp. for Euro@@ wings will be responsible for Euro@@ wings by the CEO Carsten Fe@@ hr .
with the new set @-@ up , Spo@@ hr emphas@@ izes the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
until now the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , the airlines merged with three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
the collective conflict with the pilot of the cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are scheduled to be resumed after this Thursday .
he shared the union .
the topic of convers@@ ations should be the rest regime for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faster result would come to sustainable results . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between union and airline has led to different strikes in recent months .
in addition to the trans@@ itional supply of pilots the &quot; Wings &quot; concept provides the background .
it looks ahead that Lufthansa reaches its line of Euro@@ wings on the group &apos;s group &apos;s head@@ line line .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for two months for two months
Luke Sha@@ w was a double fra@@ cture of his right B@@ one at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Eindhoven .
while that was the left eye def@@ ending to tears and exclu@@ de him for at least six months of playing , Louis Van G@@ aal will not give up hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the violation was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ ger Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was broken in the PS@@ V range .
he was treated nine minutes on the field of play and needed oxygen before it was taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said van G@@ aal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has a double noise and is situated in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be re@@ located tomorrow or perhaps one day later , and then in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 to Manchester United , and then it is fantastic , and then it happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double fra@@ cture , it will take six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno appeared to be happy with a red card and a hanging of a mo@@ f@@ meter .
Nicola R@@ izz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rator , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van G@@ aal assumed that the Italian arbit@@ rator rec@@ eded .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a mo@@ f@@ m and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a twe@@ et on Sha@@ w account : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thank all of you for your news . words cannot describe how get broken , my path to recovery begins , I come back again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here is , Manchester United suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at defeat at PS@@ V
the England def@@ enders in France has an extra inc@@ en@@ tive to recover until the coming June .
Phillip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place of injury to the place , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg cur@@ ry when Holland played against Van Ga@@ as Holland as the first time at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt your opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in another direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m sorry .
PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - following a f@@ oul@@ dering of Chris Sm@@ alling .
sure , David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that will soon learn the parents : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it nearly .
unless you are , you might be David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems , his favourite child@@ r@@ ens book was asked to refer to the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the Environmental Clear@@ ance of Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 .
it was a tough choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I would like to read my children , because it seems always a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all nice and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposed to describe the action of the book , listing a sy@@ no@@ p@@ sis of the film version of 2012 , added new characters and details to enlarge the rather short text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to see the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el was born and who died in 1991 , is completely unknown .
as if this would not be suspic@@ ious enough : the text report presented by Cameron appears to be part of the publication of the Lor@@ ax movie , where everything is artificial , and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to capture the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he agre@@ es to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron alien@@ ating the action of the book so little . here , a mis@@ erable l@@ ending , trees for@@ ged , w@@ anting , car@@ cu@@ ck@@ ling creature , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; which is devast@@ ated in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR job was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row in a row .
a down@@ ward street speaker said that the text had probably come from Camer@@ ons election office .
super@@ camp confirmed that the text was supplied by Cameron , but gave no more immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult .
if you encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , there is a difficult task , but if you choose the fa@@ ders who has chosen the UK for the tour , there is no repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 Test series defeat to my card .
I would not exclu@@ de an out@@ ward victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks website may be less experienced than those three years ago but there are good spin players in Batt@@ ing list , and the common spirit is strong ; they will bear no sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack .
this is related to Adam Ly@@ th , from the England @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
for me , the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is to be hard to analyze for me as his trainer in Yorkshire .
with its seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are oriented towards results .
there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I told it - players are their own best selection .
long ago , I had extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully hit another row for Yorkshire , another chance will come .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his position , even if he didn &apos;t put such good services , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is especially a team @-@ man .
the question , how much time a test bu@@ zz@@ ler gets to put his character is difficult .
Ly@@ res got seven chances of winning - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him - while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to home and forward .
the only acc@@ us@@ ation that one can collect , was that England began to live in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in a maximum form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex Hal@@ es is in it , and he is a perc@@ ep@@ man that I appreciate deeply .
he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he achieved 236 with us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , what made us great .
he must receive at least the same odds as before him , but this depends entirely on the team &apos;s team of team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of bo@@ ating mo@@ tig@@ ers next to Cook , creating an extra Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and I would get four Qu@@ icks , I appeared , and I don &apos;t have anything about it .
I don &apos;t see why a bu@@ zz@@ ler cannot beat there , and this left handed has already shown that he is a v@@ icious of Cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ hr has not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference there .
my former team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests before he appeared as Open@@ er in 2001 .
he has made three hundred ranks immediately and did not look back .
the afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited relationship with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may possibly see his statistics - on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a Pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup chips that lift up their hands and the trainer have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made a few wise additions at the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor to the tests might be a master@@ coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experiences , as he has played under all the conditions and against all the attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white sphere of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment into the setup .
I always felt that he created for the international Cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with the previously ch@@ ased .
col@@ t team@@ mates at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not be used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot was a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that .
some may not agree , but Co@@ aches and team members do not determine the timet@@ able .
and you need to think that as with the players , their jobs will depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy .
the Bre@@ xit Camp ( Bre@@ xit = Out@@ bound Great Britain from the EU ) could win subsi@@ dy when the economy starts into a dol@@ drums until 2017 .
David Cameron un@@ balanced new negoti@@ ation strategy to keep the UK in the EU , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n &quot; for Labour or the Tu@@ c , who broke out cru@@ el@@ ly on Tuesday because of Europe .
foreigners have also their cor@@ mor@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at che@@ ek , said some member states , as deeply dist@@ orted in several crises , like the EU it is now time , and not always from own debt , Great Britain and trouble changes that they often don &apos;t want , are satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bri@@ ghton , the Tu@@ c decided at their annual meeting that it may not like it to end@@ anger their social protection .
we also could call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance ministers climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they gain allies for reforms .
it is always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wishes us outside the UK in the EU &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Berlin - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets say that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point in which it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s c@@ ze@@ al Chancellor Angela Merkel is an allies , but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the ministry before it looks poor for them ( 11 years ) , Mitter@@ rand ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande can look at his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also an abandoned power .
Poland soon had a nation@@ alist right government , Spain is facing a left .
it is difficult to imagine that they are getting off one leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be used better to avoid Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want to do because most of the similar initi@@ ates ten@@ dencies have .
therefore , some such ministers certainly do not plan helpful notes , completely in the SN@@ P @-@ style , while Britain &apos;s referendum was accelerated in order to speed up the Bre@@ xit process , now my boyfriend is thought .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new treaty was a ple@@ x@@ ite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing from the new business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how r@@ ish the Fle@@ et Street can be on their own expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the press of oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ ons , as it was not inspired by Tony Ben@@ s inspired by Tony Ben@@ s with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can recall Boris Johnson , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; z @-@ euro Opportun@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who made a name for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ry ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed Mili@@ band knew he who were his enemies .
this was the med@@ ley of tax @-@ for@@ cing scra@@ per , phone h@@ ack@@ ers , and p@@ seudo @-@ non @-@ Indian , who own most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air thought about it , but discovered that when sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage allowing better ban@@ anas to dist@@ ract him , instead of becoming a lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air himself , when he was opposed to the speech of the EU , because Bl@@ air had rejected the principle of the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then turned down by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , who therefore opened a door .
the press has never forgiven him of that .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a kind of lap on my back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any time to repeat , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ cott , a strategy of the 80 @-@ s , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take , but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ke &apos;s official position on Europe is - I &apos;ll press it - in development .
he says that we should stay in a reform@@ ist EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps are traditional bl@@ ero@@ y tendency and the wild ge@@ fil@@ ings of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say Yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Ben@@ ch , but no Benn@@ ite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ben@@ n on radio and television this week , said that the sc@@ andal in him fought a pro@@ voc@@ alist John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a shadow Chancellor , a bad idea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it re@@ minded me about the 70 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; years when his old father fought on television to be faithful to his Labour c@@ ab @-@ cabinet , without going too far and to lose his cabinet manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys fight was still more attractive .
but to fight &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ i expression - was not that Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said anything J@@ C told his co @-@ war and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wanted to con@@ vey - think that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline will remain important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a brood @-@ centre of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron not a free map for Europe who allowed him to keep Lab@@ ours in the speech campaign as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins think so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ke basic political activities for the EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite crime @-@ economy , her anti @-@ capitalist past - is not only a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ si@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central base of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his am@@ big@@ u@@ ity to Nato , Tom Watson , he is convinced that J@@ C will not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in everything a sense of their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin turn political funds - they also have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if this can be poin@@ t@@ less ?
the USA are already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , in Libya and in Syria , even with a cost reduction by the T@@ ory government on power that was remin@@ is@@ cent of what I called on Monday by the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise report from Public Health England on E @-@ cigarettes
statement by a state financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes have been less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the Lanc@@ et by critic@@ izing the evidence used by public health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigarettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grund@@ gesetz - Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have question@@ ed the resi@@ li@@ ence of the data and refer@@ enced between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a Editorial in the medical trade journal Lanc@@ et last month picked up the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily steep basis , &quot; which he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two further researchers have written in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims to build &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects the claim of P@@ he that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes have about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a detailed evaluation of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement consists of a single session of 12 persons who were called to develop a model for multi @-@ critical analysis ( multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to result in a synthesis report ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting had a company called Euro@@ Swiss health , whose managing director had been received by British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for the public health in a sustainability report .
one of the 12 participants declared to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the financing , which he should have received after reports previously made by the Tab@@ ak@@ company Philip Morris International , add it .
the reasons for selection of the members of the body are not delivered , but include several known E @-@ cigarettes @-@ champ@@ ions , some of which also specify a sector of industrial financing in the paper .
some other participants in this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco management of P@@ he attended also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is dism@@ iss@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , no such connections or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far there is no evidence that there have been no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes have been as a way to smoking for children or not smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well@@ being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J has already re@@ acted to the claims of BM@@ J .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e cigarettes in comparison are minor , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the unique duty to inform@@ ing the public about what is proof , and what not , especially when there is so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people die annually in a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking is EUR 2 billion per year .
by showing clear evidence of current evidence that e cigarettes have not been without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of the damage caused by smoking , we satisfy our national jurisdiction .
BBC was supposed to quit East@@ man , says former chief of Channel 4
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said he has to stop programs such as East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told that commercial ri@@ val &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would give their right arm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the type of programs sent by other UK channels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he critic@@ ized the BBC that they are openly seen @-@ in @-@ law programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in a controversial time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transmit@@ ters like BB@@ C4 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tries to come in contact with the BBC for six years without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC are on behalf of the BBC , or sends it clearly from un@@ conventional ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communications Committee under his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the radio fee , which I keep medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least make its production at least on programs , the others do not make or be commissioned .
they send the Voice in a first @-@ class time@@ frame because they want to achieve a wide range of support for their future .
the idea that nobody would show this is a joke , it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , it is , of course non@@ sense .
Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a rainy tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsi@@ dies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mit@@ tedly both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would provide their right arm for this .
I am trying to see how this will be public television .
I do not believe that this would decrease the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC will blame for the hunt for the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular shows of the BBC will be back what the former head of Sky , Tony ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart &apos;s lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal system@@ ic programs &quot; should go to BB@@ C4 but they can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue they have created all these above programs , &quot; Well , we have seen all these above programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them into a window in which nobody wanted it ever wanted to see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions you can obtain the best value . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , remember all we think that one gets a great value for 150 £ per year , but for people who is a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot , ask me whether this is just because they consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - und Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should review their Rei@@ th@@ ian Mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to inform and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , only little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that there should be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should be reported in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , clari@@ fy and maintain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of the partner@@ ships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television are shown , and with the commercial channels of alli@@ ances to make everything online available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ i@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are exposed to harmon@@ ic impulse .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous system that can be controlled by mig@@ rat@@ ers of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ i@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment in which they have sound pressure that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses are working on the switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that can be gene@@ tically modified to carry the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m channels that react on ultr@@ asonic waves .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Srebrenica &apos;s Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian , that the procedure of one day might replace the lower @-@ brain stimulation , an inv@@ as@@ ives process which gives electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
g@@ our@@ ers usually respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani convinced that they did so when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scop@@ ic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , rein@@ force the ultr@@ asonic waves , which are then penet@@ rate into wor@@ ms .
the ultr@@ asonic waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ enk@@ an@@ äle into the membran@@ es of some of the worm cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these I@@ on@@ stro@@ us channels and activate the cells they are associated with such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Khal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ists will contribute to the TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion@@ enk@@ an@@ channels .
when he turns to the different creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro bubbles and transm@@ itting them to the wor@@ ms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ ions .
the procedure has some simil@@ arity with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool , which enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of the Light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , that must come down on an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound tissues can be prevented and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with co@@ therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to human neur@@ ons in a clinical attitude for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chal@@ as@@ ani said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications might focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , added .

one of the par@@ ody indicators , which was produced by Special Pat@@ rol Group .
according to Gav@@ in Gr@@ ind@@ on , curator of Cru@@ e@@ ol &apos;s designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience beyond galleries .
many artists have themselves with activists in protest movements to work and notice that they have gone outside into the real world , so that their art has an influence on society .

&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP @-@ Creative Director Matt Le@@ ver was aston@@ ished about the silence that was wonder@@ ing about advertising for the arms trade show - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give them the campaign that they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic head@@ lining , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains stronger with bright colours and animation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

what we need now is a progres@@ sion of the British Government and the guarantee that Fol@@ ter@@ ers can not be traded illeg@@ ally before our front door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the most creative art around the weapons trade show origin@@ ates from the area within Excel where exhibitors bl@@ acks fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ic products . &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student homes
eleven years ago I moved to a student residence in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the well @-@ known sm@@ iles that I have been anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , leng@@ thy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned , can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the suit in the student residence extends from slightly ner@@ es@@ cent to absolutely sc@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is temp@@ ting to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to tell the people where you come from , where you come in terms of cor@@ di@@ aries , and why you are saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frank@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite , because you are serious , guys , it &apos;s just a h@@ fe@@ ather ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
breathe in through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it sp@@ ells the conversation and helps people find out that you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes are sh@@ eri@@ zed and those extingu@@ isher would be .
let people leave .
the rooms of people often turn into beverages , film @-@ night event venues and public meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress on and their under@@ wear .
related Documents : do not think about getting to the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted , a rough handling is presented at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residence halls form a room @-@ to @-@ room all@@ ot@@ mel culture that can lead to life and soci@@ ally long friendship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be the hell for someone to recover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want to pass away our friendship , but you have to go away that I have consumed the energy that I have consumed with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to sense when a com@@ mil@@ it@@ one is exhausted from a state of maturity - and send an SMS to him .
ap@@ rop@@ os an@@ kno@@ ck : do it .
a guy in my student halls had the idea that a door locked up was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship with B@@ aking .
since you start the Uni on the back of the back @-@ mania , the kno@@ ck at the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less odd as the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s , I have something to do . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to chat and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise at the end .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
po@@ or@@ ly mixed stit@@ ches made of flour , sugar and fat make people sit down when you kno@@ ck .
food to steal is a common crime in student homes .
of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken is theft , but is it take take a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check it with the dairy @-@ owner .
chances are good for them to say , self @-@ friendliness , even if you cook in the inside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if anyone commands your stuff , it is annoying , and you have my sympathy , but try to deal with it as my room@@ mate , who added a pur@@ ge to her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise , people from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people in the tru@@ est sense of the saying that sit in the glass house .
a girl on my corridor asked her neigh@@ bors to make them something quiet , drum &amp; bass somewhat qui@@ eter than it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an exam in the morning .
they acted on it with the loud music .
when she finally heard at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighbor to sleep two hours before she left her own music and ended her door and went to her three hour trial .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would be left acci@@ dentally in the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it would not be inten@@ tionally de@@ g@@ able if you have a co @-@ resident for your future sp@@ ouse , go back and see them each day and maybe together , as they bring out all common friends to themselves ?
of course , the heart goes through his own ways - but if a hot co@@ hab@@ itation is definitely not your future sp@@ ouse , try at least to talk about your abdom@@ en with little reason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone covered his keys in his un@@ locked room is the border between a Ul@@ f and Mob@@ ut@@ f@@ one as it seems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good fight is fun , but it only takes an eye until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
be saved by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never fail anyone &apos;s room with t@@ ooth@@ paste and shampoo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water which you then put in the freezer - but do not firm their poss@@ essions on the ceiling no more than twice .
ter@@ raced houses for refugees , single moving services
the real estate business Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds on the mid @-@ Fran@@ con@@ ian corner houses for people who have not much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so roughly for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living room , but also the mother and the blood@@ stream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am showing how you can still build and grow well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview
thousands of refugees are pushing for the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly the living space can be created : it builds on a project town@@ houses for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees are pushing for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain a great part here .
in view of the refugee flow , we need enough living space in the next decades .
a whole ban@@ ales , three @-@ storey detached house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a ter@@ raced house needs last place .
it makes integration easier .
that is different if you put people in living blocks .
each of the six homes that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three units of four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it may be that many refugees are saying , it is peace again , I go back .
the houses can easily be converted easily according to respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price for 160 square meters of space per house is based on 184 000 Euro , excluding plot .
that is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
that is adequate .
do the construction rules have complicated their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I have completed my project correctly .
especially complicated makes it always the threat@@ ening Dam@@ oc@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert Sonder@@ bau and the slot order .
gr@@ ind content .
it is still under@@ stand@@ able , who creates three apartments in a ter@@ raced house needs at least three pitches .
but the place is missing only in cities .
and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did local residents react to their ter@@ raced house ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : who gave me the proposal to create luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
something which is definitely not correct .
but do not spare the competition for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true : for the last five years we had a bo@@ oming in Germany , but were built in luxury dwellings , which hardly can afford any more .
my project has the message , even ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the mother or the blood@@ shed .
I have to show how to build and build very well today .
that &apos;s why it goes .

Dr. Frank Müller takes the field of field breaks and invests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel rim breaks .
also Sam@@ t@@ gener@@ de@@ Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann are also pleased to promote business transport in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schw@@ art@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs mayor of Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
during many places in the country , Doc@@ endorf - As@@ endorf said about it : there , Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of rock climbing on 1 October .
during the retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is standing still until his successor in the next months , with half a place to his successor .
after a conversion phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October again , until then he is investing 3@@ 10000 Euro into the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy on first sight , when the Fel@@ lowship took to meet Frank Müller , his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who currently under@@ took legal education in the can@@ did hospital and also wants to get into practice next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had the mind that the land@@ lady would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ standing , and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I just called her . &quot;
the pair of Müller liked the idea of running his own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and the constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to learn and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage he also see his own boss soon .
and so one was agree , the garbage dump bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ ausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up also , followed by his medical studies in Hanover in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg and Rot@@ enburg .

during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ tor@@ ausen has worked as a house@@ work , his wife speci@@ alizes in inn@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology in the Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in ) .
the land@@ lords , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a family veter@@ in@@ arians .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the conversion , the rooms are modern look modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ asonic exam@@ inations as well as long @-@ term and loading EK@@ GS , and need a room room more .
the ED@@ V is also completely renewed .
the land@@ fill is given a supplement of € 500@@ 00 as part of a support programme of the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the municipality of Zambia ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is carried on &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; emphas@@ izes the mayor of Sam@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , approximately 2000 patients come to the practice field breaks in the North German average @-@ ranging practice around 500 patients .
in As@@ endorf there is another house@@ work practice .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy stays according to Ur@@ sel rim breaks in As@@ endorf .
if no successor could have been found , it would have gone .
those who are visiting the Müll@@ ers will continue to look at them in familiar faces : over the seven medical experts and the cleaning power of the fel@@ dt .
with their departure , an era ended in As@@ endorf . after all , the medicine was practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning , we had only two rooms , &quot; reminds upright on the sm@@ iles .
a little bit of grace they feel after the long time .
&quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or later and many patients are still often seen , &quot; says the Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in .
her husband is comple@@ mented , &quot; We have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; I have always pressed myself before gar@@ dening , now it could be different . &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also transported to our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johanna Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner , Minister of the Interior . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border continue to remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as it is clear , everyone who wants to ask for asylum seek@@ ers is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of the people stand in the foreground .
it is clear though , &quot; that it requires clear signals , &quot; said the Minister .
people must know that we do not accept an unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled way of action .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia denied
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would leave the coming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and also build cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees too .
however , the Minister of the Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , however , did not look like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of corridor is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the supervision of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is already strongly inspected for the branch of the Schengen area .
as the Minister emphas@@ ised , Sloven@@ es wants to conc@@ eal his limits for refugees but not abri@@ d@@ flats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ nig Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government divided , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday , in East cro@@ ati@@ a at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id , to retreat for the registration .
the Croatian police was able to attack them in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , there have been constantly police vehicles with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly concerned about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
the rescue services and the Red Cross are already in action .
in the coming days his country with some 4,000 refugees , former Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , said .
in addition , there would be buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo to the Maced@@ onian Serb border , which previously had mig@@ rant to the Hungarian border in the direction of Croatia , covered Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government in Belgrade refused that it was to propos@@ e certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , at least in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses were expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria
the passengers were travelling through Serbia all night long and around 500 kilometres distant from the Maced@@ onian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has made it , so the police said we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
in fact , in fact , it could now be a somewhat predicted shift in the Balkans region Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary a bit further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot;
before that , Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic emphas@@ ized that his country for the fall of a strong in@@ flow from refugees prepared such plans for possible outcomes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not called his details , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive opportunities for mar@@ g@@ inal control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you perform strict inspec@@ tions to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been a member of the EU partners since 2007 . since then , following a good testimony to the country , Slovenia has been concerned with the standard controls .
on the Serbian side some 300 refugees continue to be stuck behind the Hungarian border .
according to the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed completely .
whether the remaining refugees continue to travel to the Croatian border , it is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister of the Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic was trying to calm in a local drive in Hor@@ gos and to calm the debate about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not currently deal with very high refugee camps .
they could not say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers dial migrants to - dangerous - Alternative rou@@ ters
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute the maps on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still not more spacious min@@ ef@@ ields still over 20 years after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .
stock ex@@ ack@@ ers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Su@@ p@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have heard about a ring of Cyber@@ crime , which is accused of gaining an insight into yet un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites like Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire .
the increased information is to have been made on the financial markets with the captured information .
this way more than 100 million dollars were carried out by the Agency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our country &apos;s borders are ultimately caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the message communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;

most of the def@@ endants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators may have acts both in the United States and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical Hospit@@ all@@ ers Mannheim has existed for 20 years
around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz is re@@ igns .

you control the two stations from the Mannheim railway station at Par@@ ade@@ platz .
of the c@@ alle@@ y@@ ways .
pul@@ s@@ ating , boun@@ cing the life at stunning autumn sun@@ lit and in the middle four big panels each with the title &quot; Before I die . &quot; ....
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hospit@@ all@@ ers had attention to its 20 @-@ year anniversary with this action and is absolutely confron@@ ted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s life , so we went with the action in the midst of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hospit@@ all@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is available to the pass@@ ers as well as questions and convers@@ ations with volunteers like the volunteer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while doing a pas@@ ant spont@@ ane@@ ously to the chal@@ k , and add the sentence to &quot; my life @-@ affir@@ ms , &quot; &quot; &quot; continue to stop the war &quot; or &quot; don &apos;t suffer for long , read phr@@ ases like &quot; I &apos;m not &quot; so far &quot; and then go on .
again , on the outskirts of small discussions on the action , we develop , about life , dealing with death .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I make myself clear that by the end of this world , I can live a responsible way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Music Association of Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carriers of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hospit@@ all@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public relation to the 20 year old is good .
that everybody wants to tell everybody more openly about the tablets , however , is it a very personal thing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death and dying be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as before with tab@@ oos , the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hospitals in recent years have contributed much to that people can open . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an estimate that Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id shares .
the death and fun@@ eral coun@@ sel@@ er is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
having their personal experience with the theme , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in the process of dying .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hospit@@ all@@ ers sought him to call her , she immediately reported and was present during the founding in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and depend@@ ents in private households , hospitals , nur@@ sing homes and in the hosp@@ ice Saint Vincent .
they are all trained carefully .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id can work well with her task and experience experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see the life of another waiting , hold it for precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of out@@ patient ec@@ umen@@ ical hospitals is free of charge and den@@ om@@ on@@ ably dependent .
financial support and donations of families and societies , training as well as training and supervision of death and fun@@ eral directors .
all two years are offered training for new employees .
the panels described on Saturday are now on display in the church of the Protestant Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
further personal wishes can be recorded on postcards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports disappoin@@ ting results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant@@ len@@ cts received his prize draw for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight rates and higher costs in his Bod@@ yp@@ h service .
the company also said that she plans to be spending about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays .
last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to setup 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2,5 per cent at the Pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Cor@@ p said to earn a profit of $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year , which ends in the next month , 20 cents less than in previous forecast .
anal@@ ysts expect a survey by Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower outlook is increased despite the price increases , an average of 4.@@ 9 per cent and effective on 4 January , and despite the higher rainf@@ all for land transport shipments of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it nevertheless expected that the earnings compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and because of growth in online commerce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company makes solid earnings as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade , into consideration . &quot;
the plans for holiday employment have been announced one day later than the ri@@ vals UPS announced , which plans to hire 90@@ .000 up to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , that ended on 31st August , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just under $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research claimed anal@@ ysts pre@@ viewed .
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of them , anal@@ ysts advised from $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has had a decline in international priority shipment in recent years , which brought revenue in its Un@@ ity Express shipment .
but the boom in online shopping raised the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex ground .
in the last quarter sales were increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and auto insurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenue because of higher prices , while the result decreased due to higher labour costs in freight business .
in the Pre@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares increased by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , at $ 0.15 .
on Tuesday , they closed 11 percent of loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .

and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision to pre@@ dict it . it will be announced on Thursday by the un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented inc@@ en@@ tive by the un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented inc@@ en@@ tive by the nearby short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although most of the economic data show that they are solid , the youngest tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make a low @-@ rise representative to strengthen this v@@ at@@ ility by raising the interest for federal bonds , and be it only by one @-@ quarter percentage point . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation mainly will be the most important thing they are watching , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , chief econom@@ ist of the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think when looking for an exc@@ use , would not increase interest rate , increased un@@ certainty about the global market enough to wait , continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sens@@ us about what the F@@ ed is doing what is uns@@ ure to itself the finance market .
about half of econom@@ ists that were survey@@ ed recently by Bloom@@ berg have predicted a week &apos;s rise this week .
financial markets await the F@@ ed , however , with a key indicator that indicates a 30 % chance of raise .
this indicates a drop in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , it is because the strateg@@ ist to sm@@ ash the blow by providing that further growth is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones claimed average score at 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or around 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed @-@ Politics continues the set in this week , said John Lon@@ sky , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences to that time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to be very far in her statement to calm the financial markets that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argue that a interest rate would calm the financial markets , because they would act the un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed will act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase its way to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow increase in the mon@@ et@@ ary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer , that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be necessary , expecting an increase in the sentence .
although the creation of employment in August s@@ lows down , improvement on the job market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate declined to 5.1 % in the last month , the lowest since more than seven years and in the vicinity of the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown evidence of a recovery .
although inflation are continually under the target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representative said that the main reason was the temporary impact of clearly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them due to tension on the job market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Shepher@@ d@@ son , Head of Head at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the financial markets around the world came together at the end of the last month after China had dev@@ alu@@ ed its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % among its highest level , as investors feared that a slow@@ down on the Chinese economy would sei@@ ze global growth .
the market has recovered slightly in this month , and the Dow Jones is now nearly 10 % below the closing of May .
for the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives , the market turbul@@ ences aff@@ ecting the complex calculation when interest should increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events would not have occurred on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former US emergency tank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he says that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty about what impacts on the US economy , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world economy is none of the main an@@ tic@@ les , so they should not be included in their decision @-@ making .
but in the final effect the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the impact of the central bank was enorm@@ ously in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere reference of the company &apos;s name Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could make its monetary expansion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; displac@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; unle@@ ashed confusion around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a world in which markets and econom@@ ies are increasingly inter@@ woven , the F@@ ed representatives can be closely monitored by the F@@ ed representatives , but are also advised by other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding for global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her decision @-@ making is more art as science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management , En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey pain@@ s , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of trans@@ itions on finance market movements that apparently doesn &apos;t appear linked to the economic fundament@@ als of economic data . &quot;
in fact , the lack@@ ed member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who sets up for a rise of interest , initiated decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its conduc@@ tivity at 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite a limit@@ able impact on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of the financial stability during a severe crisis as well as in 2008 , said Adam S. Pos@@ en , former member of the Committee on the interest rate of Bank of England .
the youngest tur@@ mo@@ il do not come close to that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation where they were afraid of a rise of interest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pos@@ en , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act is still the double mandate , and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I do not think that it should take time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany during these days .
to give you a warm welcome , not without the engagement of countless volunteers .
there are also a number of people in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da to support the un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
to them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with her body and soul teacher .
she still teaches even with her 74 hand@@ leb@@ ars .

Brazil &apos;s Pap@@ en@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande encour@@ ages nutrition for healthy cooking
the SP@@ RS bra@@ zi@@ pped Brazilian organization SP@@ RS tries to clari@@ fy , how important good diet is during the feeding time . it is doing this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted on breasts which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which give the babies all the nutrients that they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers get used to increase their daily calories by around 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ et@@ etic adaptation that mothers should carry .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet concerns pregnant women actually concerns the genes of her baby and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , a healthy diet of the child can influence the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipal council of Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2,3 million euro sports hall .
he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar system .
the plans for the long awa@@ ited turn@@ tables on the amber of the sports ground come step forward by step : in the youngest joint session the extended construction contract was unanim@@ ously approved without great discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the body had previously decided on a request for a legal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respec@@ table &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion from the valid planning regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form concerning the roof structure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , a &quot; saddle @-@ roof with non @-@ mit@@ ter first and roof top should be constructed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by this we get together a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; in turn was , in turn , for the umbrella , for energy reasons - otherwise prescribed by the development plan - below ten degrees .
the volume of the hall is therefore clearly reduced .
&quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; was therefore necessary because the building plan does not allow any &quot; exceptions &quot; to the event , although the Bern@@ ese Municipal Council is usually restri@@ c@@ tive with restri@@ c@@ tive claims of liberation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gym , however , this is no recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a prec@@ ed@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym is hall@@ able at the Sports Centre is a community project between the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
the cost of around 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
grants are expected from the school and refra@@ c@@ tive stimulation .
the construction contract for the 18 x 36 meter high hall will now be submitted to the landing office with the next process step .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is a new director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees are moving from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au around .
this looked at the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county seat , which was confirmed by the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ White .
however , the supervisory board re@@ tains a decision on this coming Wednesday , September 23 .
should the plans be implemented then all of the nearly 50 staff would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au through fishermen and the next central station .
the rooms are present .
the employees who do not have to work with g@@ ong@@ au is said to be offered a workplace in We@@ il@@ heim , such as Jo@@ chner @-@ White .
the employees are informed about the plans .
triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year , and now changes to a private practice in close proximity of the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of who the succession , according to Jo@@ chner @-@ white , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into play , which declared itself ready to take over leadership from October 1 , taking his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is in any case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stand@@ ings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spread in the area &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Jo@@ chner @-@ white . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fishermen is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised on the inside station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
if the Supervisory Board goes over@@ due for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board decided to access both houses , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ Union , which has more than 35 beds , is finally to be closed down in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now the county has been planned for 2018 , when the ongoing renovation at the We@@ il@@ heim hospital was completed .
land@@ tin Jo@@ chner @-@ white , also chairman of the Supervisory Board , has contrary to what the house is owned by the federal government , in the future as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers is to be used .
&quot; I close it . &quot; as it continues with the property , Jo@@ chner @-@ White could not say , there are several refle@@ ctions .
at present there are a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day@@ space sych@@ iat@@ ric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a fis@@ her over the Qu@@ asi Move to the Le@@ ch who had been positively and very under@@ stand@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there has been a real perspective for the house where fishermen has worked as a che@@ ek for over 30 years .
he was asked to be asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take the position of the director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened again in recent decades by closure , divisions were closed , for example the surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .

in the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was murdered , the young people were killed and their cor@@ p@@ ses have been thrown into a channel in Rocken@@ hausen .
a 16 @-@ year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate led to a victim of violence since Saturday .
the young woman was found in Rocken@@ hausen at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern on Tuesday evening , as the public pro@@ secutor and police arrested on Wednesday .
as a tat@@ too , another 20 @-@ year @-@ old man , which was , according to the specification , had been dra@@ fted and the investig@@ ators drew to the finding location of the body .
the 16 year old was reported on Sunday morning , after she arrived at the evening after a visit to a autumn festival in Rocken@@ hausen not as agreed at home .
in search of young woman , the investig@@ ators first took on personal objects on the victim .
finally , a crime de@@ vised against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was un@@ question@@ ed in the circle of friends and friends .
the alleged perpet@@ rators led the police to a channel in Rocken@@ hausen where the bodies have been found .
according to the authorities , according to the authorities , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the bodies were put in the canal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be passed on Wednesday to the harbor , and the investig@@ ators put the burden to him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; information on the closer circumstances of the deed is to bring further investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees need accommodations : study war@@ ns of housing
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
even more refugees seek a affordable lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is a challenge .
the distribution tac@@ kles in the German housing market have begun long ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the upcoming refugees and unemployed from the EU , more people are pushing onto a market , which is now over@@ loaded in many cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with local citizens for the last affordable housing .
to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
this result is a study on behalf of the ally de@@ bit@@ ing of &quot; Social housing . &quot;
as a comparison : this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany .
to date 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay no more than asylum seek@@ ers are not obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers .
many come to the apartment market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statist@@ ical Office , in the last year less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed .
however , the negative trend in the housing market is not only available for the numbers of refugees .
the study also provides considerable deteri@@ or@@ ations in residential development of recent years .
Germany p@@ ushes a private budget deficit which is going to be bigger by year to year .
at present , some 7@@ 0,000 units already were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many of them were held in large cities , for example , in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained un@@ will@@ ingly in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the F@@ lau@@ te on the apartment market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the large cities the number of square metres per capita has gone down again in recent years .
in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social Basis &quot; strikes a re@@ boot .
new inc@@ enti@@ ves should stim@@ ulate the social housing .
this could be avoided on the under@@ line tax and the basic tax for subsi@@ ded rentals will be exposed .
according to an alliance attractive fiscal de@@ preci@@ ation is necessary .
the program for refugee traff@@ icking of State Bank Kf@@ W is already well @-@ known in cities and municip@@ alities .
a good week after the start was , at Monday evening , 184 million euros had already been sum@@ mon@@ ed to about € 300 million .
now the project may even be extended .
refugees have free trade : Croatia and Slovenia directed corridor a
after Hungary , practically no more is gone through , since more refugees pick the way over Croatia .
Zagreb announces that we allow transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ dles .
but the route nonetheless is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbour country Slovenia over the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have spoken with the Sloven@@ e Interior Minister , and when it is necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and belongs to the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the launching of the Serbian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia , to get to Western Europe .
500 people had come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , as reported by the Croatian television channel RTL .
Hungary had blocked his border for refugees on the day before .
new laws which entered into force on the same day are practically unnecessary asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can go through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the Serbian border of Serbia in Croatia .
according to most of the media reports , they come from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came in both the bus and the taxes on the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they had tried to get a walk over the green border to Croatia .
in the Croatian @-@ Serbian border the refugees no longer reach the border .
there are many other dangers : there are still sharp mines in the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
mine clearance now quickly create a safe passage .
after Hungary , hardly any refugees arrive after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police counted 366 @-@ tested people .
shortly before tor@@ ch on Monday they were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws operate the over@@ coming and damage of the boundary act as an off@@ ense .
therefore , in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
the convicted sentences thre@@ aten up to five years and the dep@@ ortation of the country .
according to the immig@@ ration authority , we took home to 94 asylum applications on Tuesday , in the newly referred to the border , almost all of them - 93 - on the most important transition in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with young children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees on Wednesday .
but practically nobody has a view to get asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the Hungarian view Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers should be deported .
in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke only a few hundred refugees assembled .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers started to give up .
they collected the tr@@ ash that left tens of thousands of people in the past weeks .
plywood gr@@ ille were dismant@@ led and one of the approaching @-@ up camp in the border was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express itself to the target of this conversion .
Austria is only a few refugees after closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
moreover , the country has intensi@@ fied its border controls .
but about the 20,000 migrants were still in the country .
in Salzburg some 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
the mig@@ rat@@ ory traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on instruction of German authorities .
in Freil@@ assing regularly smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
mayor drove &quot; Gest@@ ure &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy upon the bridge on Sunday with which there were 10 people with rice officials at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ ein mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to travel to Passau with the train .
because Germany &apos;s surprising because of the refugee flow in Austria in the end of the refugee camp in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ended up with two further hel@@ pers and their cars over the border to the river Na@@ he Passau .
prior to that we tast@@ ed the unexpected guests only once , with j@@ ause and drinks .
we said the same way , we bring them to Passau with the car .
&quot; that was a course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N interview .
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it take a generous donation - 100 Euro to the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; we were very pleased , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
the stran@@ ded train passages were moved on Sunday evening in Wels from a ICE in a regional train in Passau , in order to make it short of the announcement that rail traffic was set to Germany , but still to try the border .
but the regional train was placed in front of the river Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neigh@@ bors was soci@@ able on Sunday , day before a br@@ ind@@ ran@@ ate sports organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends back further Z@@ ig@@ thousands to us , is a logical result of a foreign policy :
instead of the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke storage , in order to assist human structures , our chan@@ cell@@ or has officially removed the attitude of the Hungarian government into the National Soci@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffering from this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confron@@ ted in the land@@ areas with cha@@ otic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poultry farmers will also realize that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which she has invited and welcomed nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will become a big challenge in view of the ongoing refugee currents and the coming winter , with decent resi@@ dues for future seek@@ ers .
and it will be even greater to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad at the search for 35@@ ,000 winter@@ ing quart@@ ets
Konrad has all hands full of refugees to the refugee camp .
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight .
the government had used the former Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank to represent the lod@@ gings for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first record of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gained control in a grip .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees , which had come to Austria on Monday , was without a big vor@@ tex , said Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; championship performance . &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a &quot; cra@@ cking situation . &quot;
Konrad with a total demand of 8@@ 5,000 quart@@ ets in the he@@ ur@@ ent year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations must be found in the coming weeks - 20.000 are supposed to deliver the countries .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without bottom , &quot; Konrad Adenauer .
he has already kept talks with the regional capit@@ als .
they should have secured his lod@@ gings , also for the upcoming refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria it runs well , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born who will be clari@@ fied how the church will help .
the economic coordin@@ ator also requires great expectations in the ORF @-@ action , &quot; Hel@@ ping as we . &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation easily .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ized the standards for the accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency it could not be that lod@@ gings have to hold certain height of the towel holder or the size of the rulers .
for a temporary period , &quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to apply .
unlike the Ministry of the Ministry of the Interior , Konrad with his experience is based upon Konrad with his experience .
I am an older gent@@ leman , who is not imp@@ ur@@ able without further into the face .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er are not taking charge of the republic , as they themselves explained .
their number of employees will increase it to three to four .
their lod@@ gings has not yet been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to place a container at step@@ han@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz demands a better division
there is no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings including Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary , since people are currently living without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
but in case of emergency , further locations are to be tested for their ability .
criticism of the city coun@@ cill@@ or at the allocation of refugees inside the federal state .
other districts must also be made here .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not blocked &quot;
in a longer phone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) held the following day in the refugee question on Monday .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders are not blocked .
the further journey from refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the respective border controls .
special features with refugees to Germany do not give it any more .
however , the f@@ law would be transported to Germany with regular trains .
at the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger also asked for more reinforced solidarity in the refugee question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that now Austria is entering the controls again , for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a logical consequence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New shi@@ py@@ ard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrial line is officially closed .
in four of the six floors of office and production buildings , the listed IT Group S &amp; T came in , the rest ( 2700 square metres ) is intended to be le@@ ased with young , innovative companies from the technology field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine how to invest in start@@ up companies from the New shi@@ py@@ ard and later to act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neigh@@ bors - pro@@ positions himself a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a question of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compared to 1.7 million euros , S &amp; T was invested in the site , 3.3 million Euros of the Tech@@ Center that belongs to a third of the city of Linz , the country Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is p@@ ho@@ ver@@ ted from Linz AG to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center for 60 years .
30 percent of the 2700 square meter floor space in the building are already rented , for a further 40 percent give it qu@@ eries .
L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ corporation opened second shop in the arcade
in the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are at the centre point .
she really wanted to get a dog .
this project had to move the 49 year old owner of L@@ ia Per@@ oni into the Tau@@ be market @-@ arcade @-@ hand . finally , it has now gained momentum in the form of another business local .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the deal , in which they sold bags , suit@@ cases , shoes , and clothing of different manufacturers , they now turn everything around ladies hand@@ bags of the Vene@@ la brand , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
this has been rebuilt several weeks ago .
&quot; I have waited for a long time , if I want to open a store , &quot; says widely .
decisive for the decision was among others also the Fur@@ la @-@ producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of their own site , where only their hand@@ bags are sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the greater area of Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your fashion interest has gained wide from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
for me , most of them are evol@@ ving , and I can show new trends at reasonable prices .
why some women look at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , also the specialist lady could not answer with the last security .
maybe it is possible that a nice bag is applied to each outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s ancestors were ancestors of a place whose inhabitants are named An@@ ders .
this property also bin@@ ds some billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the U.S. president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he expresses himself in a foreign policy , journalists are concerned or announ@@ cing knowledge in international crisis policies - the candidate for the US presidential election stim@@ ulate the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and cuts well with it .
this will also be registered in the town of K@@ all@@ stadt , where grand@@ parents of the real estate markets originate .
the New Yor@@ kers with the hair dryer is a concept of many in the wine road on the wine road .
some places in the 1200 inhabitants resort is more than -@@ zig corners with it is related to it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in its campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del filmed a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think it is exciting somehow but not so deeply impressed , &quot; said Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has turned a am@@ using documentary on the location and his famous spro@@ uts , among which Tr@@ ump also includes the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) also to Word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful also if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has not brought it to the king of hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , they also tend to say that Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a bit a big mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inci@@ dentally , the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the radius , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - said : the investors , says she .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is thus from the village of the investors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the story of the &apos; Tr@@ ump &apos; success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather and opened a restaurant in gold for gold dig@@ gers .
property of property portfolio were the first property of land in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to home in the country , in the Bavarian state , to which the Pfalz were back at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he once was without permission , he was director of the Institute of pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ic History and Folklore , Roland Paul , to the film start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
blu@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ ration . &quot;
this is in contrast to the occasionally striking statements of descendants .
he had repeatedly spoke about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called to build a boundary wall , in order to d@@ eter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so symp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote k@@ umps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a native of Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the wind at the wind is rather dist@@ ressing the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you believe Tr@@ ump happens ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension fund in Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm is mentioned as many K@@ all@@ u@@ ter that a desc@@ endant of the members of the Heinz came to a visit to the church organ that was generally well received .
&quot; I cannot imagine this by Donald &apos;s , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he does not know the election because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such a radical Views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the days at the time of his grandfather in the US had been as he , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; said Win@@ zer@@ a Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as a President ?
&quot; my president isn &apos;t it , &quot; she says .
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
W@@ end@@ els Film , who has been inter@@ viewed for the Tr@@ ump , have seen 12 000 theat@@ res , also in USA spar@@ se the interest .
the highest Bavarian town of Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
from the source of the Vice @-@ President at the German Alpine Association , Ludwig U@@ su@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village in the National Park of Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden received the award for gentle tourism .
in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ers . &quot;
in the neighboring country , the Alpine Association is responsible for the award of the award .
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one @-@ fifth of his area must be referred to as a colony .
Seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine , to run the loss of leadership in the Today show
Karl Stef@@ anovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hur@@ ry to Can@@ ber@@ ra in order to report on the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but there are no big shifts in the reviews for today .
the opening show of Nine was set by the federal capital , the Mal@@ col@@ m Gym took the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the R@@ ival Sunrise , with the hosts David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television broad@@ casts that also belonged to Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to play no part for Australian TV spectators , as the sunrise recorded an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five main cities , compared with today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today , an easy increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today the gap to sunrise is closed in recent months .
in August , Today , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 .
previously in September , Sunrise is on average 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change concern this morning more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are in order , thanks for the review !

the big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Pack@@ ed to the ra@@ fting of Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama of a recently bo@@ wit@@ ty father who decided to settle down with his two children at the New Zealand coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 219 million viewers .
critics were wonder@@ ing if Thom@@ son could wear a solo show without the Raf@@ ting Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and struck easily The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ .000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
Seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new Quiz show , presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe revealed an average of 44@@ 6,000 viewers .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jum@@ ped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening the Chase Australia generated the first half @-@ hour of The Chase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour was 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the drop in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Chase Australia will fully agree that hot Se@@ at will prevail at 17 : 30 at the end .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have un@@ certain who wins the Bachelor &apos;s bach@@ elor .
the woman , in which Sam Wood was gro@@ unded to the Bachelor &apos;s Bachelor , was env@@ elop@@ ed in secret confi@@ d@@ ons .
and none of the three left girls will certainly not give up if she is the one who has received the last Rose .
but when we met with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before two of them checked , you might have been acci@@ dentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood has sealed his lips to the final on Thursday
all three women have om@@ itted this in ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods latest Rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could their answers come to the game , who won the heart of the brook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki name both quickly - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I got into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s Energi@@ es , I felt that they were quite compatible with me , and I thought that they were quite compatible with the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is on the ground with both feet on Earth , it is so much fun to be with her , &quot; said Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood were suitable as a pair .
from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit of the house was clearly made for her that Wood &quot; could be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and my family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not only a game - I am now un@@ att@@ un@@ ned to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when they were asked who Wood should choose , if not it , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor &apos;s Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the USA - and there were many other teams , who sent requests for his impressive open day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ dn chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart decision .
some of the trainer had ban@@ ished to the Bank for the rest of the game , when he lost a triangle as he did on Tuesday through the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by @-@ Liga @-@ Kon@@ vert@@ it at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnes@@ ota .
but Tom@@ islav trust his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a Pun@@ t @-@ return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ as@@ ula continues to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of holding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula weak@@ ened Hay@@ den publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ repor@@ ter Cam Indi@@ man told that Hay@@ nes was also encouraged by special teams co @-@ ordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ G@@ aug@@ hey , who advised him to forget his sp@@ elled cat@@ ching , and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne pat@@ ched on a Pun@@ t , who was restored in the first quarter of the Minnes@@ ota ;
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian u@@ fol@@ k@@ age had hop@@ ed for his N@@ FL made debut .
Hay@@ ek left after the f@@ um@@ ble the playing field and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy in Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine a bad start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; that was a thing that comes up now , one takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ dn said .
Hay@@ dn gets rid of the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut at the time of 2007 when a pass was leading to Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ go@@ al area .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old .

the Free voters want the employment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria for the high number of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the FW @-@ Herbst@@ kl@@ au@@ sur , a large number of students at the beginning of the FW @-@ Herbst@@ kl@@ au@@ sur , in France there are no new teachers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 extra teachers to preserve the schools in front of the collapse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; otherwise we will get dist@@ ortion in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the daily dev@@ ot@@ ation of the Free Elec@@ toral Plan is scheduled to take place in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e by Friday .
actually , different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free Elec@@ tor meeting .
&quot; the subject of course is applied for the clause , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection areas for refugees in Syria , as did it during the Yugoslavia wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is not going on , we must believe in the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Elec@@ tor Chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ab@@ gel@@ ding asylum seek@@ ers want to push the Free Elec@@ tor as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also asked more staff for the administrative courts , which are responsible for asylum applications : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum procedures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the FW @-@ CEO critic@@ ized that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; we want to use across nationwide standards of the Bundes@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria is wrong , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we need to be more flexible . &quot;
but the country &apos;s policy is not falling under the table .
one year long lasting tor@@ ch remains on the agenda : the picture policy .
for the new school year , K@@ ult@@ us Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) launched the pilot project &quot; Middle stage plus &quot; in which an extension of the school level was tested from three to four years - in the result it took nine years to the secondary school again .
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger &apos;s not far enough .
&quot; the topic of G9 needs to be accelerated , &quot; said the FW head .
we demand freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums that we want .
a free journey over the G9 to where it is desired .

4 people killed after police fire at protest@@ ers in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after demonstr@@ ating the rubber band into a crowd who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , senior district official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were gathered outside a police station , some of them threw those stones and fire@@ bom@@ bers .
Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said , the police have inserted Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then shot in the air before she returned to rubber floor .
20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it wasn &apos;t immediately clear why the rubber floor@@ space used , of which is known to be , but traditionally used to be used as a less deadly alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate .
the conflict was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nep@@ als southern planes where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces they would be formed under the proposed new constitution , to decrease their political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal ethnic group of Th@@ arus , who want to create their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , became in violent disputes since the 10 .
in August , when the four major political parties signed a agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a controversial topic in Nepal , that was controlled by centuries .
the work on a new constitution since 2008 is on the way , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ature have voted this week via specific cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he also feared as many other project critic , that the traffic would be greatly increased by the intended size of the plant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be entire bus@@ ses , thus says Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well @-@ known area of the former gas place , however , is still open .

for slightly overweight di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful .
according to a new study , the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years .
it is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who received non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , which wrote an editorial to the new study at J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss treatment or obes@@ ity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb .
over the years , O@@ bes@@ ity procedures have been proven efficient to treat type 2 diabetes as efficient , but most studies were carried out by people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain level of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that somebody is overweight , and people with a BMI of over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BMI : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have been collected in a study since 2007 and compare two kinds of obes@@ ity - stomach acid and gast@@ ric acid training - for type 2 diabetes for people who were easily overweight .
the average BMI under@@ going this operation sank from 31 to 2@@ 4.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile the BMI remained on the one that received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among those who under@@ went a surgical procedure , the diabetes condition was completely dissolved in 36 % and partially with 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , in comparison with diabetes , diabetes was fully dissolved in only one percent and at only two percent .
in addition , the results were found in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol , &quot; in general , in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also super@@ vised the patient @-@ blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease mortality compared to five years , as leader of Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery Group had more weight lost ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and reached greater re@@ funds in the BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 5.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence of a study of heavier people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , Black@@ stone says from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was subjected to obes@@ ity suffering from obes@@ ity , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group called conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival at surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is soothing for people with a BMI less than 35 which are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this low BMI group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without a high risk of death or kidney illness , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously , once the patient is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we take people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that as soon as they have accumulated this genetic change , they have connected their body with obes@@ ity and diabetes , a conversion is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story playing in the H@@ uns@@ rück

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe couldn &apos;t record all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leader urged to stop the violence in the home countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of prolonged refugee crisis to the beginning of his ten @-@ day long visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which dev@@ otes himself to ethics .
he demanded that in the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the response of Western European countries ad@@ den@@ sely admi@@ ra@@ ble against refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even though the Dalai Lama praised in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to conduct the crisis , he emphas@@ ized that it was a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to care for several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long term solutions , like a real peace and genuine development , mainly due to education that can be created for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we must consider how the killing is decreased in its countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and did not comment on George bus &apos;s action after the terror attack on September 11 and turned out that the non @-@ violent response of the US drew a chain of un@@ authorised inci@@ dents .
after September 11 I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to resolve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence and caused unexpected consequences &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
qu@@ il@@ ateral increase of disinf@@ disinf@@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the past 4 years
tox@@ ins in the USA reports about an almost 400 percent increase in number of children under the age of twelve , which swallowed alcoholic and disinf@@ ect@@ ants such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income of hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants for children under 12 years , has reported to report po@@ isons level , from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are increasingly common to those products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them go in the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN .
he said that several children disinf@@ ect@@ ant drink inten@@ tionally , while some are doing to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ ation of the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ant could drink only because of one cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ant with soft mou@@ th@@ wash water to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be caught by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; one child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are perf@@ umed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ant with stra@@ w@@ berry , wine grapes and orange du@@ les , which are very appe@@ aling for children .
disinf@@ disinf@@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
few sprit@@ zer can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it &apos;s highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; says Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Gif@@ t@@ note speech at the University of Kansas , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t have a drink whis@@ ky but humans leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come from it then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six year old girl , had recently taken four sp@@ lashes of after stra@@ w@@ berry bus@@ ses in school , was taken into an emergency painting .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is deemed to be dr@@ unken in an adult at an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ aved her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the Not@@ ice .
doctors watched her over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , as the girl was fallen by the alcohol and had sli@@ pped the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ahu &apos;s mother , CNN .
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has parents and teachers recommended to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ant disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
over alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were linked to death .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario , after swal@@ lowing of the disinf@@ ect of disinf@@ ect@@ ants , contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities assume that the product was contained in meth@@ anol , a fatal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active agent .
in January they planned three students from the fourth class in New York State , their &quot; reported &quot; teacher , &quot; by using anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says it a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic against disinf@@ ect disinf@@ ect@@ ants . they ban@@ ished them out of their space .
the police acted as &quot; Gesch@@ w@@ ät@@ z &quot; as &quot; Gesch@@ w@@ ät@@ z &quot; and reported disciplinary action to the authority .

the lack of title competition in Scottish football - de Bo@@ er
former Rang@@ ers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic people , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with Rang@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in the Netherlands , they do not show highlights of the Celtic Games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here are not just talking about the return of Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams , and that &apos;s what they are interested .
there is a lot of excitement in Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn the things around , confused De@@ ila .
R@@ onn@@ y De@@ ila had accepted that Celtic people must fight , but the Norwegian conductor sw@@ am to turn things around .

De@@ ila told , &quot; Celtic people had bad times already , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry , or sad about what happens .
we feel it that way - but we must go on .
we really need Celtic , actually the support from Celtic , because that makes players better .
getting together is so important .

why I will be the execution of a execution in Oklahoma
something later , except during a late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is put to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it is not happening , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the case of death in Oklahoma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , if Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is ex@@ ek@@ ed by the tox@@ ins .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was first published in January on his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day was closer , I began to fear myself .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists may see exec@@ utions in the USA , and since more applications as places are available , a mak@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery is held to decide who is chosen .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media slots between 12 and five .
who is selected will observe it am@@ eless .
I can &apos;t do that .
in addition to Richard Glos@@ sy &apos;s finest boyfriend I will sit with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to capture a notebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist in Oklahoma accused me on Twitter to aband@@ on my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of conscience as he wants to and you get access .
I compl@@ ained with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they expressed it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she could have been better form@@ ulating , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she still thinks it is false that I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ s@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I had to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can always remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter is present to write there .
if he dies , he thinks that public@@ ity work will help against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a reputation of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go down here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would blame him to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is no sufficient evidence to just@@ ify a death certificate .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and I will see him from this perspective .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters , in which you can object for it .
what you &apos;ll get from me is what it says , a man to see an unnecessary death .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables and threatened to stop the race immediately .
he aimed at ste@@ wards and the Integration Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race of the year on Wednesday , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy preached Fair@@ fax Media that he always tries to do what is best for racing and he himself was found under difficult conditions as it was about the positive cob@@ alt @-@ rehear@@ sal in Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain .
he had kept back 18 months because of the esp@@ ion@@ age acc@@ us@@ ations and did not want to see it as high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have taken a long time on it , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything suddenly appears suddenly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know they are far reaching .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the effects , and I have to live with it what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I &apos;d like to walk around the head , and I want to think my owners , that I try to do my best for her .
if they begin to think , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more coach .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
before , Moo@@ dy had to go up the bomb during an interview with rac@@ ing.com , trying to spy out his barn .
&quot; before ei@@ ghte@@ en months . Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - who I will name - and to give him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a che@@ at .
if this is the case , they should certainly deal with their n@@ oses , because they have failed to express myself .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , current CEO of the RV@@ L , and Bernard S@@ undry , were aware of that time and are still conscious of this .
should it take me to mind that it will be personally ?
does the RV@@ L be@@ have beha@@ ved and possibly makes people responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside because I &apos;m there .
maybe they have to take my license and put me in doubt , and I have no doubt that what I say , that now is thinking about it now .
but I arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and it makes me sad .
it really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert the pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Train@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is based on the long lasting cob@@ alt investigation with Li@@ bo@@ i and the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching meant that he could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cast his license on the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation for the irre@@ plac@@ eable master of the Black C@@ avi@@ ar , marked the course treatment was &quot; ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied on the pen of the horse , which pushed against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my staff has put it down on the leg .
it could have been like yesterday evening .
it could have been so yesterday the whole day , so it was .
but it had as well on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confron@@ ted by a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package at the race day . an examination of this proposition was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules , know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
man for drivers repor@@ ters arrested
on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a coll@@ ision with a cycl@@ ist and followed @-@ in drivers in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with helicopter to the Royal Melbourne hospital with heavy injuries , after being taken by a car on the Saturday morning on the Murray @-@ Valley motorway .
the police said that drivers continued to stop , without stopping to help the injured driver .
on Monday , a 50 @-@ year old man from Nath@@ alia was the police in She@@ pp@@ art@@ on .
he is expected to be indicted for driver accur@@ sed and because of other traffic code .
the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram left in the hospital . it is in a stable state .
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy proposes to fight ri@@ vals for ring claims
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised criticism of the Tac@@ kling of his Player as &quot; Agenda &quot; &quot; of two Premier League &apos;s favour@@ ites of N@@ R@@ L .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sydney Roo@@ sters coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators of the Storm player &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring@@ ier &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his team have been allowed to have access to the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brisbane Bron@@ ce Trainer Wayne Bennett did a hardly hil@@ ly comment on the Storm Team after his crew scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample @-@ example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two of Que@@ ens@@ land refused to be &quot; good &quot; in the struggle .
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ li@@ mg of his team and told that she just focuses on the tac@@ kling of her &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainer in his team wishes him confi@@ d@@ ently , because they worry about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; that &apos;s always up and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring competitions than they told us 24 : 2 , Bell@@ amy said on Wed@@ nes@@ days .
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing at our def@@ ensive system or techniques in the past six weeks . but in the last six weeks we have made contact with tac@@ kles for a real focus , and this has been the trend revers@@ ing for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not getting used to it , it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny as it always shows up again at this season .
Bell@@ amy has attacked the idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and re@@ minded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ i St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; more boring &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; Bell@@ amy was speaking .
I remember that in 2010 St. George was critic@@ ized as a boring team and Wayne said that he would take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , in particular his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football - not each team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play like this .
I build up confidence because they say these things because they &apos;re a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the g@@ Storm against Roo@@ sters showed a higher result than the game of bron@@ ch@@ ial against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ x was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is it an exciting game ?
or are breaks , and do not find any points ?
for me it is the game boards .
if they mention us , it means that we will come to a stage in one phase .
the Storm team did free on this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening in the final finals at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales start next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200.000 $ deposit to drug an@@ kl@@ days
a man , possibly threat@@ ening a li@@ fel@@ ong penalty , threat@@ ens to come into possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled in Que@@ ens@@ land , has been released for a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested the last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America over V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the J@@ ach@@ thafen in the course of the mor@@ nings and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite an potentially li@@ fel@@ ong penalty for attemp@@ ting to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire quantity and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the High Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of violence at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations to Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
during the pen@@ al matter , he lied to the police above his where@@ ab@@ outs .
his father and step@@ father &apos;s father and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together in order to reach his release .
&quot; after reading the ei@@ vable statements of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a safety of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said judge Flan@@ agan .
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to stop him from it , he warned not .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against the deposit , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ated off his Australian and his Serbian pass , to the police daily and stops at a cur@@ few of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : Dri@@ f@@ house cat@@ ers apart
a truck driver had been heavily damaged during a dri@@ ve@@ way with three trucks along the highway 5 at Karlsruhe .
two of the three participating trucks had slow@@ ed down in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to do@@ dge from the last moment , as the police shared .
the management of the accident property was completely apart .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 pm .
there was a damage amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone number used by girls to enti@@ ce ped@@ oph@@ ile to send pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hi@@ lic used to call the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took on the phone &apos;s phone when this slept , in an online mess@@ aging service , he obtained a number of incomplete pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it , it found conf@@ using news and al@@ arms immediately her mother .
the police acknowledged and saw the five images , analyzed then computers , which were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches , the terms for search of in@@ decent pictures of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g claims towards the official people that he would have done it , because it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educ@@ ators on the internet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he then called &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a polic@@ eman to fri@@ gh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the At@@ tor@@ ney E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction - that he was addic@@ ted to fri@@ gh@@ ten people .
he gave that the search was done on the computer of him , but said it was done , because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ gh@@ ten a ped@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked about his discussions with an unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more pictures .
he told he to enti@@ ce her .
he said he was sick in his head , when he drinks , and said he would like to see pictures of ra@@ pe and murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and crying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they then looked at the un@@ stable images on the phone and con@@ front the def@@ endants .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the def@@ endant computer and Play@@ station used to speak to girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ dee , pleaded not guilty to the Indi@@ c@@ tment charging of un@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June of last year and not appearing before the trial on 24 March of this year .
defence attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g appears not in the Register of sexual offen@@ ders , as it could argue that &quot; no up@@ lifting sexual element &quot; can be found in his failure .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael appeared if the judgement goes to October to obtain background reports about social work .
H@@ og@@ g was given in this case , but hear@@ ings have been kept in provis@@ ional detention for other cases .
he was still admitted to the date of judgment in the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
dro@@ pping soft to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are off at the border tro@@ ll@@ s on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many locks were made from fear of discovery and capture the people increased in smaller fron@@ tier positions
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man said the German police .
along the river river Inn , Vienna and R@@ ott@@ al @-@ Inn have picked up more than 1000 refugees on Tuesday .
they were on foot over bridges and h@@ ubs to the German side .
there they are taken into receipt by federal police officers and forwarded to registration .
according to federal police station in Munich , following the weekend on Wednesday , more refugees met again .
around 700 people have arrived in the provincial capital alone up to 8.00 hrs , said one spokes@@ man on the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the town .
Stuttgart : prec@@ ursor of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest
met@@ e@@ ologists war@@ n in front of the stor@@ er@@ mines in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure range throughout Western Europe , hot sea air flows in the country , the German weather service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart serves .
the strong was the f@@ ooth@@ ills of the &quot; Henry &quot; model , who has drawn the Atlantic ocean over the Atlantic in the last few days .
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected mainly in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , the Black Forest is also available in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Alps and for the water seek@@ er with sheets of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday , the sun can therefore again be seen .
the ground makes it : every two years , the car at the IAA show their novel@@ ties .
in 2015 , it is especially evident in the compact cars , which are particularly well used .
cars from the compact class are currently particularly important : around 28,@@ 1 percent of the new car regist@@ rations accounted for at this segment only in August alone .
this is reflected at the International Motor Show ( public days 17 @-@ 27 September ) .
a lot of new compact models will be presented between all the futur@@ istic concepts and luxury cars this year .
one of the largest premier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at dealers in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the trade fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
the volume model is also well sold , the new Astra is also not much more expensive .
Opel is an introduction to the biggest compet@@ ed Volkswagen Golf in view , starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs € 16 990 .
the Astra boasts a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , H@@ esse will offer additional diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time to include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engine .
unlike the main competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra boasts the Astra in five steps only .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi which is already shown at the IAA .
and what will the Astra be next to the new Opel compact car at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra competition in the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively classified as a five @-@ se@@ ater in a conventional and sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes to the beginning of next year , then also as Kom@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan Racing driver wants to find its position in the strong growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits perfectly into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
in the offer is a diesel with 80 kW / 109 PS or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzu@@ ki Bal@@ eno that celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is measured after production data of 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
the start of sales of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed , the new DS 4 compact class model is to be seen at the IAA .
the designer of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ers installed especially hand at the front part : here the radiator grill was drawn new and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology .
the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system has especially modernis@@ ed the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system , reduced the number of buttons by a touch @-@ screen and first Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play is integrated .
in the compact class , a series of over@@ work and new variants are added to the IAA in the compact class Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cells are deser@@ ted
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the Te@@ gel law firm which was in prison for months in a small cell .
in principle , because of violation of their dignity , In@@ mates are generally eligible for financial compensation when they are accommodated in small cells .
this decision was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
these persons could even hope for their judges if they were locked in only a few days in the confin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner has been successful in Karlsruhe with his const@@ itu@@ ary service : he was accommodated in a single cell with around five square meter floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spatial , not separate .
after that , the man , who has meanwhile been lying on the loose foot , was moved into a larger cell .
his professional liability Clau@@ se because of the un@@ worthy conditions against the Land Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Court over@@ took the judgment of the Chamber of Justice in Berlin and to re@@ prove this case .
they see the man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
chamber @-@ chamber decision therefore decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if for legal reasons only a few days of arrest shall be decisive for the compensation , a compensation regulation was given . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to worry about the legal protection of personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber of chamber must now clear the amount of money .
the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners bound in the past .
they did not say , in April a prisoner of damages , because he was locked in the prison cell .
In@@ cen@@ un@@ worthy is a single deci@@ ding of a cell without separate toilet in 2011 .
moreover , in addition , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed a prisoner in a parallel event in November 2009 , also confirmed an un@@ worthy accommodation .
the then @-@ time K@@ lä@@ ger was over three months from 15 to 21 hours in a lock@@ able cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also gone into the head@@ lines because of lack of staff .
prisoners are always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ sion increases , even to pun@@ ches it should have come because of the cl@@ amped situation .
according to the rule of Justice , 21 positions in Te@@ gel for offspring are not occupied , 19 should drop in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we can do that &quot;
the migration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Germany , about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers come to Germany , according to the according to Viz@@ in@@ anz@@ ler Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to record a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated in the face of the unusual challenge of determination : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes on Germany , gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts between 3@@ 500@@ 00 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Education ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Pest@@ ana Institute ) apartments annually - and the next five years .
that is almost twice as much as ever built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of living space but especially in affordable rental objects : yearly 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 integr@@ ations out of the rental price will fall , and in order to apply these particularly convenient apartments too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Federal Minister of Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double its funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
much too little is that from the sight of the pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 social w@@ astes have to be created every year and therefore , the Con@@ federation would have to invest a subsi@@ dy of 6.4 billion per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agree both scientists and Federal Minister of Law in it that there will also be more tax rul@@ ings for investments in residential construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the estim@@ ations of the Institute for Employment Research , 55 percent of the poultry sector in Germany can be employed .
however , the refugees in Germany would not have sought after their qualification to help them with Claudia Walter , a project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Stiftung .
but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial if they find work in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the est@@ e@@ em in the reception company , but also for the self est@@ e@@ em of immigrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ational Resear@@ cher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the throne there has been a political turn@@ around in Germany : from the Labour ban for refugees to recognition .
while it was previously a working ban for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as resi@@ den@@ ces that asylum seek@@ ers is limited to one residence .
in society , because of the expertise , the evidence of evidence of the task was to asser@@ t that refugees should be faster to access the labour market .
a major hur@@ dle for the access to the job market are the missing German knowledge .
so far there is no sufficient offer of general and based language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often imp@@ art@@ ed by personal contacts .
therefore , the structure of networking is based on the view of Thr@@ än@@ hardt the Royal Path to Labour Information .
the Berlin School Management has noticed that only a few @-@ wing@@ ed parents include their children in the nur@@ ser@@ y , estimated ten to 15 per cent : &quot; for the un@@ earth@@ ed parents it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ gre@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate department .
to convince the advantages of the K@@ ita &apos;s advantages , the management of the management is distributed in several languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators who rise sharp@@ ly through the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of vocational training - by means of higher education .
pupils are prepared in the countries with no German language skills on the classroom .
but they are not always taught by trained teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack of lack , Be@@ ate St@@ ket from the Berlin School of School .
the German Student Framework estimates that around 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
generally , no federal land of asylum seek@@ ers or imp@@ ati@@ ated the study - the only exception to date has been Berlin , internal representative Frank Henkel ( CDU ) , but has now given up his post@@ ure .
study subjects refugees could be reli@@ eved from the university &apos;s approach .
for refugees with a residence or det@@ ach@@ ment do not receive any benefits after the asylum seek@@ ers law , if they begin studying .
the latter basically won &apos;t get BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G as they fall not under the circle of persons .
so far , Ged@@ ul@@ led refugees have had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible to be eligible to use BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G from 1 January 2016 to 15 months .
but this tax gap must be closed , so Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Student work .
students should immediately get BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G .
Islam will be a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually adopt the same rights in Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches @-@ law to develop a new state of state religions .
it would also be important to the creation of an Islamic prosperity that took out professional around the new@@ com@@ ers .
the right hand includes obligations .
so the representatives of Islam have to agree with clear contact persons and to agree with the state in many areas and to give up some control possibilities .
this includes also the read@@ iness to measure the controls against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , went on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany .
those who wanted to go out such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will be much more than today to be a topic of the whole society .
as a result , the majority society needs to change , degra@@ dation of discrimination and rac@@ ism .
indeed , Germany has - as a result of European choices - for a decade a anti @-@ discrimination and a general gender equality law .
but it very slowly lear@@ ns how the NSU @-@ mur@@ ders showed , in the police and authorities ignor@@ ant the rac@@ ist motive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same opportunities for all : what Mig@@ rant organisations and the st@@ ak@@ eholders &apos; rulers are long asking for a long time and what international agreement will become reality in the coming years , if the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens are to benefit - for the well @-@ being of all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally , Germany is capable of providing medical care for so far , commented Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; as for Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create this , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel ) .
however , additional money must flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , in all deriv@@ atives , is required to compens@@ ate on the registration of health cards .
services rendered may be cancelled later with federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term it is most un@@ question@@ able to save so many people with the Limited Product Catalogue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fore@@ see the asylum seek@@ ers law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , doctors have especially to create the language barriers .
until now , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has been detected , migrants are more po@@ or@@ ously fied by their ill@@ nesses than other patients .
not only in clinics , including in physician offices , she would be asked to charge them .
many refugees have also been helped with even more general proposals in the emergency ambul@@ ance .
and with a different diagnostic view .
in the refugee camp , there are clearly more untreated disability , and with the young people it is taking care of HIV recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance .
with the partly other path@@ ologies German doctors come from their education , but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; paras@@ ite diar@@ rhe@@ a or tuber@@ cul@@ osis are not so difficult to identify . &quot; and , as for the p@@ onder@@ s , it may even be a relief in sight by the refugees .
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system , some refugees even have doctors .
in order to practice , however , they would have to prove their quali@@ fications and disp@@ ose of them again .
at least half of the refugees arrive in Germany , according to estimates of the Federal Patent Office ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , psych@@ ically ill : most suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic Stress Dis@@ order or below depression .
Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K , were especially vulner@@ able to refugees .
a recent study conducted by the TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee camp had been traum@@ ati@@ zed in Germany .
whoever is suffering from a post trau@@ matic Stress disorder suffer@@ ers from other things both of the so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with respir@@ atory , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , and death fears .
further symptoms include bed@@ - and concentration disorders , strong ch@@ ival@@ ry and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic , an early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z declared .
so far only four percent of the psych@@ ic sick refugees receive a psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can put an application for a psycho@@ therapy , however , the processing takes usually several months .
in addition , in the social groups , experts or doctors who are not trained for mental ill@@ nesses , decide whether a therapy may be necessary or not .
this often lead to mis@@ evaluations , says Mun@@ z .

&quot; Man@@ e@@ quest@@ ered cocktail with world city fl@@ air , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept .
50 cities on the almost 3 000 km @-@ long tour can now experience this fl@@ air .

Zim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe keeps wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , was down stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the case spread quickly over the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also ref@@ uted by the attacks by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned against the proposed language of Mr Mu@@ gabe with the call .
last month they had hat@@ ched him and interrupted him for his speech to the state of parliament in parliament . this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition leaders have received SMS messages on their phone to inter@@ fere with Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es An@@ unci@@ ation .
&quot; the news comes from a number that won &apos;t appear but she said the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists after Mu@@ gab@@ es speaking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she war@@ ns the parliamentary group members that ends the imm@@ unity in the Parliament and once they leave the Parliament , its parliamentary imm@@ unity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Hewlett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP is later split up into two publicly traded companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a load of more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP said in one explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures will enable a competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair@@ men and Chief Executive , leading the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than it is today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before fulfilling the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual revenue and is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; focusing on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integrated technology solutions for companies &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such a statement of the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;

HP has a massive re@@ structure to manage the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area based on the belief that close @-@ focused businesses a better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed over Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it did not until September and if his rehabilitation is progres@@ sing according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play Christmas again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer at the European Championship is still un@@ certain .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had severely killed the last season following a separate ank@@ le injury , and then had found back to his old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threat@@ ening the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone which has not been healed .
this is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in touch with his an@@ kles , or with the injuries he had before .
that may be true from a purely medical view , but like Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the related danger of further injuries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
there is also an un@@ pleasant patterns .
Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 lig@@ asp@@ ings in the last five seasons .
the wider picture of the ar@@ sen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League clubs .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability of the last season will last .
&quot; sometimes , if you return from injury , you have a time period in which you have to strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he gets through a career of the way he deserves .
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb to the play against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ sp@@ ur on Wednesday , turning a rotation by the team .
chan@@ ger Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not traveled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta is ari@@ oting .
Wen@@ ger can also get started with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need to allow a small embar@@ k for g@@ lowing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal are clear favour@@ ites , by Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the largest in@@ ti@@ fying effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has started during the last season .
the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , and was measured on the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the belief that the ar@@ sen@@ al has moved the doctrine from the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains committed by far away to manage the association to his first European cup of Europe .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked with ar@@ sen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand , I am long enough to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Celeb@@ ration : the com@@ edy show , giving us serious lessons on men &apos;s friendship .
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially in terms of how the need for men to open themselves now has become more des@@ perate as ever before has proven suicide in young men on a 15 year h@@ och .
in 2013 , it was the main cause of death amongst men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the issue , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Meas@@ er@@ ings ( CA@@ LM - Camp@@ a@@ ign against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 was announced as the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture in question if they need them if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ pressed symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; noted that when the suff@@ rage had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; healthy mood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; its chances of recovery doubled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of spiritu@@ ally healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course , one has to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of social media communication , with its focus on substance , the in@@ compatibility of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital life have the need to appear powerful , fun , and successful , even if the isolation is dominated .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologist expressed values ; money , image , social status , everything on cost in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much more deep .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was placed on her head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality that shines through the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments of soccer gu@@ ins in cozy s@@ lab@@ s and the longing of Ross to Rachel , all these came out of the knowledge that men can refer to each case , even if they are often with@@ holding their feelings to explore completely their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the telephone numbers told me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my audience leader for people who are de@@ pressed and killed self @-@ suicide , really showed me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us are often not able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old familiar phr@@ ase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness , if you are talking about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; friends is one of the shows that comes in mind when I try to offer long term management mechanisms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it clearly presents the little moments of men &apos;s friendship .
so very , my objective global status via the phone helps people in moments of desp@@ air might also help . long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely new designed scenery , so why not take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know which difference your friendship may make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ festival
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G , Malm@@ ö to pieces
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani for showing his hits vs Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G talks to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani stopped course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain launched its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League Deb@@ it as PS@@ G players who scored the French masters on their way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head@@ ball at the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in the group A takes Paris a strong start to the Swedish masters since they strive only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ Round only , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ alists in any of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was no classic race of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ h@@ ov@@ ics adapted chances before the gate . he later became in play against his home town team and against the club , with whom he began his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 .
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to get back and relaxed , even if there are certain things we have to perf@@ ected in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; that &apos;s a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in one of three changes in the Paris team , Alex@@ x@@ ovic returned to Paris at the weekend when he held a 2 : 2 draw on its own place against Bordeaux in the first division , but he was cast out in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argentin@@ ean wing@@ ers was called the man who took the PS@@ G on the next level in Europe when he entered the last month of Manchester United when he entered the last month &apos;s pass behind Malm@@ ö &apos;s pass , before he finished Johan Wil@@ net in the long corner of the network .
but if anyone believed that PS@@ G was a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off proposed to reach this level , stood at An@@ p@@ iff with nine au@@ dien@@ ces in the field and was a big opponent with a five @-@ man def@@ ending and two deep in the middle field .
but apart from a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , the far spent on Kevin Tra@@ pp &apos;s posts in the 3@@ 4th Minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , as instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes appeared , with some mis@@ ery and bad connections , not least rolled out by Ibra@@ h@@ ovic , who was pat@@ ched alone in the first half only after Cav@@ allo had put it after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless he showed much more skill when he brought his players into play , and there was a pass of Ibra@@ h@@ ovic , which Di Maria resulted in a shoot that was guided by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the coup ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours @-@ brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . at Uruguay , its sixth part of the season , after Get@@ him@@ ovic reached a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all thought that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent input of wild and no distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result could be low , before substitute E@@ ze@@ qu@@ ill Lav@@ e@@ zzi was detected at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de announced later that PS@@ G played a class on his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then , we played in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level .
the qualifying games do not suff@@ ice . &quot;
hat off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented a change to FC Bayern in 2008
world and European Champion X@@ avi plays for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
only some years ago FC Bayern was shortly before the arrest of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner league tournament , four times champion title champion , two time champion title , two times European champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in the summer , the meanwhile 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now av@@ eng@@ es that he was standing before the departure from Barcelona in front of EM 2008 .
&quot; one told me that Bar@@ ça would sell myself . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything that we don &apos;t tell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s also the symbol of FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have . &quot;
in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .

matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ted the af@@ ro@@ American filmm@@ aker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the diversity and said it &apos;s not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during a series of Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proved this the need of alternative perspectives . in relation to a black prot@@ agon@@ ist in the chosen screen@@ play of the project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not by the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Brown responded to a sho@@ cked dis@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor from The Mar@@ tian starts to consoli@@ date . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the production of Ben Mon@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to think people to think about it - who will be always the director - how to handle the character of the harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line that is beaten by her white side .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of Dear White People set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for direc@@ ting rights at the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direc@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could give us something that we do not want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&apos; American Ninja Warrior &apos; The first champion
pro @-@ sport climbing and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first Ath@@ let that won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which ended just its 7th season , had never seen a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obst@@ acle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten until the finals .
the climbing on a 75 foot @-@ long climb@@ s included in 30 seconds was the last task .
Brit@@ ten ended the task within the time he completed the first athl@@ ete , who finished the stren@@ uous Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended up this challenge for a full three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock about winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or for life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his bunch of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so pretty suddenly .. like I can &apos;t imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood repor@@ ter to discuss the finals and why Brit@@ ten , although he finished the par@@ cours , did not receive any prize money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the rules , the money goes to the quick@@ est person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the quick@@ est time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and the life changes , he receives the great atro@@ ss .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;d he@@ ared of any gro@@ ll .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received numerous awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had@@ n &apos;t changed the roles .
America Ninja Warrior was extended to an eight season - the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers s@@ ne@@ ak past Minnes@@ ota &apos;s Twin@@ s
mint - The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once again they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , now the tiger &apos;s last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as a spo@@ iler , but did play this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minnes@@ ota Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the Twin@@ s gave a chance for Ascension in a half @-@ half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League of wild @-@ card .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F word that was so hard to gras@@ p on a big part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad P@@ m .
tiger Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inside , then in the sixth and then again in ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times in 1 / 3 inside and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was not his third successful start into his final nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; Simon said .
it &apos;s hard to throw any game in the bull@@ pen and so I want to go into the game .
the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had 3 hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit play of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against Seattle in July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has with@@ held the impact on wood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ach@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( kick training ) , looked much better in the bull@@ do@@ zers , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh holiday , the Twin@@ s had their best chance to come into play again .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton completed the inning with a double on the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks got a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over the wall , the only man facing him , was confron@@ ted with the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie bu@@ zz@@ ler Miguel S@@ ano , who gets a Two @-@ Run , where he was appointed for the right @-@ handed ro@@ ok@@ ie .
with a pair of runners and the final run on the second , Ver@@ hagen assigned the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double Play .
it was the most important league in the major league for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe claimed a double play .
after arriving at the end of the ninth inside a Insurance Run , Berlin established a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ rest of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the status of 5 @-@ 4 .
in the right handed , however , S@@ ano is entitled to three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit offered the game start of the game by an even more mobile Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers recorded three R@@ uns in the first two in@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been rep@@ ain@@ ted before the game of the vulner@@ ability after having spent more than one month because of his back .
&quot; obviously not the beginning , which I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt whereas I started and felt that I was creating some fairly good pit@@ cher as in the third inning . &quot;
after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter at the first , H@@ wrote a single second to second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z was born to Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z , who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing Position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single stamp on the right , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he was trying to get to third the threat .
the tig@@ ers used in the second case recorded a one @-@ out double from Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said Twin@@ s Manager Paul Molecular itor .
he has not especially struck well , but he caught the right job .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch Count , no points scored in the third In@@ ning before he was replaced by the Rel@@ ie@@ ver Right @-@ Count A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there came to three R@@ uns in six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes outs .
comments : tig@@ ers R@@ HP A@@ ni@@ bal San@@ chez was out of case of injury to the limbs .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the San@@ chez shoulder in 2007 .

concrete figures she did not called her and showed talks on Wednesday in Berlin .

Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have so far not been able to agree on a common procedure in crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take on Tuesday ( 22 September ) with a special request for a new attempt to add a further 120 000 refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee &apos;s in Germany , the Con@@ federation wants to support countries with the first intake and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Government will manage this together with the Länder , in the late Tuesday evening , Merkel announced almost four hour consult@@ ations with the prime minister in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ line those people who assemble the protection , com@@ bing it too .
but those who have no lead perspective could also not remain in Germany .
this idea has been unanim@@ ously divided in the round .

no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his le@@ ek line will rather not be blocked by them .
because Man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
healthy fruits are still healthy : in them there are B vitamins , as well as vitamins E and C. mainly Man@@ gos eat much vitamin A and its pre@@ amplifier beta car@@ ot@@ ene .
whoever eats the fruits , thus supports vision@@ ing , immune system and met@@ abolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or firm and smell comfortably .
the paint colour alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green man@@ gos are delicious .
you should store in room temperature and are consumed within a few days .
they taste of course pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go gives also heart@@ y dishes a special touch .
they alle@@ vi@@ ate bitter taste man@@ cher Bl@@ at@@ ts@@ al@@ ate such as Chic@@ ore@@ e and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well to fish , poultry , lamb and ven@@ ison .

on Wednesday and night on Thursday the F@@ öh@@ n blo@@ ws partly with the wh@@ ale strength .
after F@@ öh@@ n@@ ende on Thursday morning a prominent k@@ alt@@ z crosses us that brings strong rain falls , wind gu@@ sts , and a temperature decline .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a strong southwest exposure .
on the side of the Alps , the snow falls on Wednesday by the valleys .
as a result , the hair dryer is blown up by Thursday morning in the bo@@ ils from sheets of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .

Rome now has a Martin Luther square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there exists a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of Municipal President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a previously un@@ named place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ formers .
in Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now honoured as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ al of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located right in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the name was applied by the Protestant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome re@@ minded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were often only able to live in secret their faith .
with the square become visible in a symbolic way , that the tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the end of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 in Rome .
he received the city then as promised for a sin @-@ nav@@ el .
his negative impressions will have encouraged him with the view of histor@@ ians in his later battle against Rome .
Luther continued to im@@ press his thes@@ es against the Ab@@ las@@ sh@@ an@@ del .
hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dorn@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main works made by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ mail wrote the introduction writing and Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not by the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with magnificent images .
in the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 different designs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and fan@@ ciful forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but by no means it is equivalent to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary , the particular topics are adapted , it can work quite well .
for three years , Ot@@ mar Alt work on his bi@@ ble @-@ project for which he has taken a subjective artistic selection from the many theme areas of the &quot; Book of all books . &quot;
cycles , such as cross , pl@@ agues , commandments , or f@@ ather@@ less , are formed .
thus , he spont@@ ane@@ ously fascinated several partners : that &apos;s true for the Luther publishing house with his the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his emphasis on art books .
and there is mainly the author of Klaus Al@@ te@@ post , who faced the painting of the Bible with the relevant works of the Bible .
he has interpreted the Bible chosen by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus &quot; Today , &quot; translated into current texts . &quot;
these lyrics are like verbal arrangements .
nestled between the original Bi@@ blical quote from Martin Luther and a proposition by the artist , who has formulated his personal ideas for the particular situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden Let@@ ter@@ s@@ ors .
so the 75 year old is allowing twice a deep insight into his soul , its emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately embar@@ rass@@ ing for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant pastor Order .
&quot; the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane , &quot; reminds himself of Ot@@ mar Alt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have attempted to work for this , perhaps to bear me back with the Lord our father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; his second concern is to help &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more vac@@ ancy qu@@ ities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perception of imag@@ ery is marked by advertising , and that is no@@ isy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being pushed back .
artists have a different desire and joy to show things .
pictures always have something mystery and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt aims to let the viewer go into the pictures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take a look at yourself , discover and feel what strength they have , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for his oppos@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klaus Al@@ te@@ gr@@ is stressed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ ways to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like how he p@@ ushes with his paintings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not observe the Bible completely to capture the Bible , but the myst@@ ical topics , also chosen for him .
&quot; that was not working at eye level , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; here are the pictures , the text simply explains . &quot; arose a picture of the Bible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther &apos;s publishing house this work is an invitation to find &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his life to deep@@ en and freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Images speaks for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( Bi@@ blical ) Language of Love and responsibility .

&quot; I hope this year is still happening , &quot; she said .
then it should be started without &quot; further commemorative break &quot; with the work in the former indoor pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees till 2019 . in the weekend , the Bundesliga sets a clear indication of the weekend .
the football respon@@ ds to the hiding location in Germany and sec@@ ures politics to help in addressing the emerging problems .
&quot; I have been bound that for the greatest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say , that &apos;s nothing about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interested in getting a grip on this subject in the gras@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B &apos;s leader Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am the chan@@ cell@@ or and met the State Minister Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ uz and the Chancellor Angela Merkel next Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the topic certainly will play a central role , &quot; he announced .
the soccer can help and wool .
but the decisive turn@@ outs must be policy .
therefore , the German football league has therefore expanded its refugee &apos;s initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung , we ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; explained kidney s@@ bach on the ver@@ ge of the UEFA Cup in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also some federal states support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 pro@@ fi@@ dent are a clear sign when taking place on the left tri@@ cot instead of the otherwise usual sponsor logo ( Hermes ) . &quot; we help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s Sport@@ s@@ Ful@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) , comm@@ ended the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ comprehen@@ sibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama is every one , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football states , no , we need to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities for helping the many refugees who have been so incredibly pleased to help , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ open@@ hei@@ ms CEO Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent mark of the league . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the EM @-@ Quali@@ fication game against Hungary on this Friday , the women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nier@@ s@@ bach called the support of refugees as a &quot; great joint venture of German football . &quot;
the 36 license packs in their own projects have had its own projects , be great .
just as magnificent is that small and smallest clubs are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we spent , is lived in football .
&quot; this is of great importance , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year the association consists of 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DF@@ B &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the federal government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; after the accident on the staircase in the house of his brother in the USA , he moved to midnight on a water glass that he carried in the left hand over the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic week &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is re@@ leg@@ ated , has been s@@ wo@@ oned , has then dra@@ gged to the road - which he has told us so last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; c@@ ites the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his work .
&quot; early October we meet in the Chairman of the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Pl@@ att@@ ner .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager might be involved with the meeting and &quot; fully oper@@ able . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday &apos;s edition ) , he will return to Germany in October again and will continue to the software group .
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP now , fully in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I understood the whole time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its president Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner , &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t said : &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
he usually comm@@ utes Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually between Germany and the U.S. , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to say with such a personal story to the public , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is important to stand up again when you like it . &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without R@@ EU@@ s against Kras@@ no@@ dar : turn@@ key in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , the hopes of Marco R@@ EU@@ s &apos;s com@@ eback in the first group game of Europe have definitely won .
the National@@ spieler become the table leader of the soccer league in the du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 @-@ 19.00 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot look back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if R@@ EU@@ s will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga top game against Le@@ verk@@ usen the Bv@@ C @-@ Coach says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its trunk to R@@ EU@@ s position .
thus he announced a change on the door@@ way position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ ds takes the place of stem keeper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; praised the world champion .
however , in the future of all European league @-@ games , Tu@@ ch@@ el made it open to all of Europe &apos;s League games .
high probability , he will also deny the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general statement of the player R@@ EU@@ s that the final decision for the Bv@@ B in the Europe league will be the goal for Julian W@@ eig@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It isn &apos;t that wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to retrieve the title . &quot;
Robotics cars : government wants to lead to Germany
Germany shall be at the end of the Federal Government on the conduct of the car technical pioneer .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided to create a strategy of strategy from the house of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , among others , investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the Autom@@ ata International Motor Show from a &quot; new Mobility Age . &quot;
the automated and networked driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also wants to discuss the subject with his counter@@ parts from the G7 states that will also meet the representatives of the industry at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the strategy of strategy of the Ministry of Transport is emphas@@ ized among others the importance of the mobile broad@@ band extension and a generous turn on digital radio broadcasting .
testing of new technology currently generates a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to check out the legal conditions and where necessary to adapt to new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to employ around internationally that the permissible speed limit for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h is lifted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government also wants to deplo@@ y a change in the Convention of Vienna , which so far can only be seen as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver will drive more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras , which collect the environment and process the data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Research , highly automated driving will be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles to public streets are expected to be expected by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value of drivers in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany estimate the authors of the study by 2025 to about 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road transport , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD @-@ road leaders S@@ ören Bart@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the question of liability in accidents and safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars however are scep@@ tical - much more than Fren@@ ch@@ men or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday of the For@@ sa Institute in order to asser@@ t that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will continue in the next ten years , 32 percent believe only in 20 years , 31 percent believe not at all .
in France , 21 percent of those survey@@ ed by 2025 will count on auto @-@ driving cars , 33 percent in the US .
anyway , drivers in Germany are still not ready to leave a self @-@ prop@@ elled car .
after a collection of the digital @-@ banned Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the entire journey on all streets .
on the motorway , the traffic could still imagine 15 percent , at St@@ au 45 percent .
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ work and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
according to present status , Düssel@@ dor@@ fer doesn &apos;t want to fight off the cover from 25 September to 4 October only in the single .
the final decision shall be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo the title , &quot; Bun@@ dest@@ ra@@ iner &apos;s Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head said in Düsseldorf during the course of the EM course .
by this time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term granted sponsor in China .
the 34 years old German champion is expected back on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo the dis@@ advantage is , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who conduc@@ ts the S@@ etz@@ ular List in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , was also remembered by the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Timo Scheider was also missing , and we are European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that is what we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; declared the World Wine List .

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant .
it is a mixture of quite big fashion show and a watch @-@ like hor@@ ror kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Bour@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display man@@ nequ@@ ins , who look human with video projec@@ tions .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great star of fashion scene - and with that he was able to hide men in skirts .
&quot; I can no longer say that I have the en@@ f@@ ant of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it was not easy , in the meantime , it &apos;s real , &quot; Gaul@@ tier said .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , that of September 18 to see in the Kunsth@@ alle of Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a fortun@@ ate that the fashion designer has changed his first revol@@ ting position at a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually , he would have been , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition seemed a bit like death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come into the museum .
the impressive collection had already played in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; it &apos;s going so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hard @-@ looking plant of the man , which has written fashion history without having ever completed an apprentic@@ eship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is a super@@ bly chore@@ ograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , which was used for much effort : to catch the dolls , for example , a styl@@ ist was hired .

the Gaul@@ ti@@ ers old Teddy is also present in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , stylish fashi@@ onable sal@@ utation of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and poor in football ) he dressed his te@@ ddy B@@ HS and clothes , said Gaul@@ tier .
with a doll to play , his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him .
he later taught the design of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashi@@ onable manus@@ cri@@ pts and saw the designs of other designers like Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought these things , of course .
for his first own fashion show he didn &apos;t pay the models .
they got nothing , but they could keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ ush tip as fashion niche
in the past , it was working on long stra@@ igh@@ ten@@ ers in and around Pl@@ auen &apos;s point of making meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ikes occ@@ ured in great quantity for customers , which they worked for example to ceilings and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ ret@@ old Pl@@ auen .
instead , the fashion is important .
in the beginning of the pl@@ unger summit , fashion has played a major role , was then displac@@ ed by the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past sty@@ list@@ ic periods , is an increasing customer potential .
those who are not used in the textiles industry in Germany are no longer available on the market .
with us they already make up half of all orders .
E@@ quest@@ rian pl@@ auen is together with nine other companies member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ let@@ on lace and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they are allowed to wear the registered label .
in the last 15 years , about 80 percent of sales have been cut off .
private business and also the wholesale store are almost no longer available .
our products are barely able to reach customers on this road .
nowadays , the mass @-@ ware in the Asian area will be much cheaper and distributed almost exclusively over chains .
and in addition , exports , current to Russia and the USA are weak@@ ening .
sufficient reasons therefore for new ways .
the industry association seeks to focus on environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer , by embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year we have been introducing a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and soci@@ ally toler@@ ated . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Faculty of Applied Arts at the University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized on st@@ icker and tips .
to counter the competition from the Asian region , one must find high quality and innovative products .
it needs time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a voltage field between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that need to think mainly economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design often varies just slightly , to keep a customer base .
a few years ago Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ uter the historic snow@@ ball point new .
the machine follows small spher@@ es on some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Pl@@ au@@ let@@ in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ se had inspired her : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I was able to do nothing with traditional plat@@ ter tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they use the bulk tip for its jewelry .
in an elabor@@ ate process it character@@ izes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people of the region identify themselves with the theme of pl@@ ump , young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland , mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in pl@@ ush and surroundings and want to mem@@ ori@@ ze mem@@ orials .
with this I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador for the pl@@ ush tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; &quot; &quot; legends should not touch it , but Disney also dar@@ es to make a new film of his classic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Weekly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not possible to re@@ make a new film , but rather a kind of sequ@@ el , who plays 20 years after the first film with the magic children &apos;s ma@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s about the experience of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks &apos; family in times of world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .
but the director is sure : Rob Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; at the cinema .
XI p@@ ushes for opening the economy to open the economy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy has to look wider on the outside to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday a group that was entru@@ sted with the re@@ aring of reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should set themselves to l@@ ure foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business activities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote new start and promote reforms , bringing new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , said X@@ i .
the leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to control the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promoting private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the inhabitants of Mel@@ des@@ immune system .
according to the statement a negative list will be created , which identi@@ fies sectors and companies that are not in question for investments .
the system is gradually tested and tested by testing programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance since it provides a greater role in allocation of resources to ensure a legally established business@@ man and open the market open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government also loos@@ ens inspec@@ tions concerning the powers entru@@ sted to the companies and ensure that companies will decide how to manage their businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to cross new models of cross @-@ border co @-@ operation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
within the framework of a quot@@ a , state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are open for private investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the lawful interests of foreign fin@@ anci@@ ally financed companies and provide better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; promoting the requirements and facilit@@ ates the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to guarantee the lawyer &apos;s right to exercise its activity , and to use professional judge and pro@@ secutor , also discussed in a session .
the meeting also took part in Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Liu Yun@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli as reported in a statement published after meeting .
EU wants to double mercury @-@ value in cat@@ fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wishes to double the limits for mercury in big pre@@ dat@@ ors and thus aff@@ ords a considerably higher dose of nerve damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ ood@@ Watch , consumer organization , dra@@ fted proposals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The risks and side effects of industrial and environmental policy are harsh , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values for large fish are supposed to be lifted up from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish at the end of the food chain .
large pre@@ dat@@ ors , however , are so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury that amounts to approximately 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches based on the still valid limit values .
after dou@@ bling the limit values only 14.5 percent would be irre@@ voc@@ able .
according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to reduce the limits at other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller cem@@ ore fish , such as car@@ p , are most often bur@@ dened as they can already comply with the proposed maximum values today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the sender of Kl@@ einf@@ isch is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dent de@@ fle@@ ction game which only helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a high @-@ toxic heavy metal for humans , which extends over the food chain mainly in rob@@ ber@@ y fish .
accordingly , the federal government war@@ ns that &quot; already small amounts can cause especially in un@@ born damage of the nervous system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Ministry of Environment declar@@ es its website regarding the valid values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health threat of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is driven primarily by coal burning in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of German coal , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bo@@ ck ordered more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total volume produced in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish around Elbe , Rhine and Danube be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cited from the paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , some European war@@ nings of mercury in fish had been added to the common health risks in the EU warning system RAS@@ FF .
