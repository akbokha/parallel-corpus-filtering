between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the Field of controlled Nuclear fusion and Plas@@ map@@ hy@@ si@@ k
the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , below , &quot; Commission , &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and THE Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this program includes the creation of a large test complex , the project J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a shared company after Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - listed below &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common company J@@ ET &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - listed below . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland employs several years with research in the area of controlled core fusion and the plasma hy@@ si@@ cs and is perfectly familiar with the area concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since up to the practical use of the controlled core fusion are still extensive , it is in the interest of the contract parties to prevent their relevant efforts to accelerate their respective research which have gained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis -
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement should be able to deplo@@ y any contrac@@ ting party in the area of controlled core fusion and Plas@@ map@@ hy@@ si@@ k to ensure the common objective of these research , i.e. , to achieve the common objective of these research , i.e. , by using the controlled core action reaction to reach faster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve the objective of the agreement , the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss Programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are associated with the compliance of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme will include long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom programme ; it will be extended or altered by checking new activities in accordance with Article 5 to 10 and article 16 of the present agreement , that may be relevant to the Eur@@ atom program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each time , if the contrac@@ ting parties have a new program , this is the place of the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II to the present agreement .
the association given in par 1 is realised by : - adequate participation in each of the contrac@@ ting parties during the preparation and implementation of the programs of the other party ;
- Exchange of the staff under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and third countries , with which Eur@@ atom concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories which are involved in the Eur@@ atom program ;
- Inclu@@ ding the right to access to scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
within the scope of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Association designated in Article 2 Section 1 of this agreement , the contrac@@ ting parties shall conclude an association agreement , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Association Agreement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which is as far as possible , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Association Agreement &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; herein@@ after referred to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is taking care of the agreement that Switzerland is involved with the date of the agreement on agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agreement on personnel exchange &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

I command myself to confirm the consent of the community in these changes , and suggest you as an appointment for entry into force 1 January 1978 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be thank@@ ful if you would confirm your government &apos;s consent . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be thank@@ ful if you would confirm your government &apos;s consent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a letter change between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobil@@ isation of Member States within the framework of the medium @-@ term financial state
the BI@@ Z could close stand@@ by credit agreement with central banks of the credit@@ ors if the banks issue a relevant application .
the agreements could be concluded up to the total amount of the fee paid by the credit@@ or , and within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds of the member countries .
however , there are already some conditions mentioned below , whose application would be ready to use the BI@@ Z .
with each stand@@ by @-@ credit , the BI@@ Z would initially assume a commitment for two years , with the possibility of extensions best without being crossed for a total of five years .
with the opening of credits as well as their possible extension , the B@@ IS would charge a credit rating .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first bricks are not made prior to the end of a month following completion of the stand@@ by agreement , so the Bank can make the necessary adjustments of their own liquidity .
the pulling would be made available in the currencies available at the end of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to time limit taking into account the means of the Bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those who address the BI@@ Z at the time on similar conditions , i.e. , interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the B@@ IS has to pro@@ cure the required funding itself on the market , then the rate of interest could reach a maximum , which corresponds to a corresponding margin of Libor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would be thank@@ ful if you would share the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ Z could close stand@@ by credit agreement with central banks of the credit@@ or , if the banks provide an appropriate application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be thank@@ ful if you would share the consent of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I command myself to inform you the consent of the Council of the European Communities .

in@@ diluted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum must also cause an easily identified ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells .
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10@@ per cent floo@@ ding of A1 and A2 blood cells , that is necessary when the same attempts have to occur with the back , but un@@ diluted International standard preparation of anti @-@ A blood cells or with a standard prepared of equal activity .
if anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on a slide @-@ up with a equal amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent , the ag@@ glut@@ ination is required within a double time , but if the same attempt is performed with the anti @-@ B blood type of blood cells or a standard prepared Avi@@ dity .
if an anti @-@ B + an anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object @-@ carrier with the same amount of a 5@@ - to 10@@ percent flow of blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination will occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 Â° C .
anti @-@ R@@ h blood groups sera of any specif@@ icity can be one of two types , which is distinguished by the pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ites under which a ag@@ glut@@ ination hom@@ olog@@ er is achieved .
with others that are referred to as &quot; in@@ completely , &quot; a ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be reached with the presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as Rin@@ der@@ alb@@ um@@ in or with the help of other special methods .

the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group may be changed if International Pre@@ par@@ ates are available ( i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood type serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is derived from blood of one or more people who are immune by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human blood cells that don &apos;t contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a tit@@ er of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e &apos;s blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution .
a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the once again , but un@@ diluted International standard prepar@@ atory of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ rh@@ o ) ser@@ ums or equivalent comparison to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , serum should react with blood cells , the Do @-@ An@@ tigen , react .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are intended for use of object portraits according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , have to be mixed in 30 seconds of a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination by 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people who are immune to the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h @-@ Systems .
it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding of human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but not with human blood cells that don &apos;t contain the C an@@ tigen .
these Ser@@ a are therefore only specific to the C an@@ tigen , if the tested blood cells are w@@ alled in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tit@@ er of the Anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 vs C@@ cd@@ dee @-@ blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;

anti @-@ e serum is derived from blood of one or more people who are immune by the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) should have a tit@@ er of at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ e Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object portraits according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and in no form of anti @-@ D ) must be mixed within 30 seconds of a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
the specif@@ icity of anti @-@ D + -@@ C and specif@@ icity of anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood immun@@ ised individuals or can be produced by mixing by anti @-@ D anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both anti@@ bodies have to be effective under the specified reaction conditions at the same time .
is a serum for use on object portraits according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , so the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ time should show any kind of red blood cells that show a reaction , not inferior to the anti @-@ part anti@@ bodies .
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A .
anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ized human red blood cells containing A @-@ an@@ tigen , that means those of the blood groups A and AB including the sub @-@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2B ; it ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ized no human red blood cells that contain no A @-@ an@@ tigen , that means those of blood groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard preparation of anti @-@ A blood cells or an equivalent comparison unit , separated with floo@@ ding of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B red blood cells ( 1 ) .
if anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent , the ag@@ glut@@ ination is required for any in@@ und@@ am@@ ination within the double time , but if the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood type or a standard prepared Avi@@ dity .
